Daily source code for February 22, 2005.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Transmeters?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We don't need no stinkin' Transmeters?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Get ready for the Federation of Rocker!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Podcasting! It's Adam Curry!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, hello from San Francisco!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Everybody, hi!

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Welcome to the Daily Source code.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It is Tuesday, February 22, 2005.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Coming to you from the lovely Adagio Hotel in San Francisco, California.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your Daily Source code, it's about 9.30 in the morning.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's cold out, let me correct that immediately.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's about 8.30 in the morning.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm so messed up.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I didn't have any jet lag in New York really to speak of, although,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was feeling a bit tired around 8 o'clock in the evening,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
only a week of fish in my microphone.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Make sure we can hear each other well.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But you're out here on the coast.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Ooh, yeah.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a little bit wacky.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I went to bed last night shooting.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think I went up to my room around 8 o'clock.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
A big black Angus burger steak for the room service and crashed.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And totally crashed.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In fact, the black Angus burger is still sitting almost like a look.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I wonder what that looks like.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've never really looked at my room service the day after.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All right.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, it's that.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Ooh, yeah.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That does not look very, you know what it is.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Just kind of the fries or the fries are left there.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I woke up before my alarm clock this morning.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I had a set for eight o'clock because I wanted to talk to the girls back home.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Since we now have a eight hour time delay.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You know, when you're hooking up with people you're meeting and, you know,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
it's always inconvenient time to just talk for a little bit.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And the wonderful thing, of course, is that, you know,

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
these days you can talk for hours and hours and hours with anybody you want in the entire world

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
because of Skype.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I use Skype out since, you know,

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Patricia likes just the regular handset and I still haven't completely,

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I still haven't ordered that Skype handset for downstairs.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But even so, you know, what do I pay like,

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
it's like two cents a minute to call anywhere in the world.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Skype just absolutely rules.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, unfortunately though, this hotel, even though they have

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
an amazingly fast connection, it's really nice.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a wired connection.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So you have to, you have to plug in.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's not wireless.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So otherwise I can walk around the room and do all kinds of stuff.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And I have the world's largest cell phone, basically.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And the reason why I can't do that now is because it's one thing that

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mac is done that is really not smart on the power book is you have two

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
stereo speakers.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So you got, you know, speaker on the well, you have stereo speakers.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So one stereo on the right hand side of the power book,

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
one on the left hand side.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The microphone, the internal microphone,

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is actually built into the left hand side of the power book,

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
which is right next to the speaker.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So if you're on a Skype call, you're not wearing headphones on your

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
power book, then whatever the other party says,

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
they will hear that come back to them and kind of like a delay

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
depending on the latency of the connection,

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but that could be almost be, you know, just like an echo.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, not very handy.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So I was wondering how they fixed that with,

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
because I've used I chat, I chat AV,

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which I like quite a bit if you're doing video chats.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And I've used that a lot and I've used it hands free without headphones.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Like, what are they doing?

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What is different?

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You know, is it the software?

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Is it filtering it out?

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Until then I figured it's actually pretty simple.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What they did with I chat AV is the audio from the other party

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that you're talking to comes through the right speaker only

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and they disabled the left speaker.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, that would remove the, that would remove the horrible echo effect

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
for sure, but it's kind of like a, you know, like a, you know,

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
well, it's not a very interesting fix because, you know,

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Skype doesn't know how to do that, I guess.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Maybe Skype can figure out how to chop one channel off.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Anyway, that would be nice if we could get that working.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Because I do like the idea of talking hands free

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and I've been investigating some equipment

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
while I've been here in the States.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Looking for, see, I went into New York.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, first, when I'm looking for, I'm looking for a pair of wireless headphones.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They aren't too bulky to take with you, you know,

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and actually even better, perhaps.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And that's why I went into New York.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I went to Sam Ash, which is a famous store for musicians

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
where you can buy instruments and all kinds of gear.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Managed music stores right next door across the road.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And I'm looking for two things.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
One is for a, kind of like the Madonna headset,

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
which has a monitor there as well.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So it's basically a telephone headset,

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but it would be wireless.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So it have one little box that I hook up to my laptop.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And then I, and I could walk anywhere I want

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and receive the call that I'm getting.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And of course, use the wireless mic.

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I could do the same when I'm recording the source code

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
because, you know, I'm pretty constrained.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have to sit right near the computer

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because of the length of the headphone cord

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
where it's, I love roaming around as much as possible.

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was also looking for a small,

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
yes, a little teeny battery powered mixer.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You know, something that I could just use on the road

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
because I stupidly forgot my eye river.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I have the yep here, but the quality of what that records

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
is nowhere near what I could do with eye river.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can't believe I forgot to bring.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I thought I had everything with me.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So I haven't really been able to do any of the outside stuff

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
that I was, you know, potentially planning on, on, on doing.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And I couldn't find it.

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I could not find the little mixer.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There were lots of, you know,

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
a little bit bigger mixers, which would actually work quite

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
in a nice state home.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But I want something I can take on the road.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And I was talking to Madge Weinstein, who was in Florida

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
talked to her for a couple of minutes the other day.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I said, Madge, you know, what are you using?

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And Madge is using a mixer from radio shack.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I went, yeah, I got to hit the radio shack.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The radio shack always has exactly that plug

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
that you never thought existed

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
conversion cable that no one would ever dare make.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And if not, they've got all the, all the plugs in the wires

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and the solder and the soldering iron

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
for you to put it together yourself.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hmm.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I'm taking a sip of tea here.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In the room, they have a,

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
it's a nice hotel, by the way.

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They have a little beverage center.

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So of course, you got a mini bar.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But then they have a coffee and tea.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And you can set that yourself, which I always like.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I really, really enjoy just being able to make my own coffee

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and not have to order up or tea.

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Because I like drinking tea a lot.

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And what happens inevitably, usually in US hotels.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't know about San Francisco.

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But in most hotels in the States, if you order up a tea,

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you have at least a 70% chance that the tea water

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
has been put into a container that held coffee

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and it just tastes like shit.

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So it's nice that you can, you know, kind of control that yourself.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So daily source code.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Today, we want to talk about commercialization,

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
because that's been what a lot of my trip has been about.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I want to talk about radio, because I've gotten so much feedback

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
from so many smart people, particularly in New York,

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
about the future of radio, where they think it's headed,

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you know, just, well, the future of radio, where they think it's headed.

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
They're not enough.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And today, this afternoon, or I think, yeah,

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that's probably a cocktail thing or whatever,

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
but this afternoon, this evening,

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
are the, the wired rave awards.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So I was planning on

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
gussying up a little bit and going to check that out.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And just a chat a little bit for the next half hour.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000

00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,260
But why isn't it working here and I have another cell phone which is

367
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:02,900
That I carry with me usually if I go to Holland because it's my Dutch cell phone and that does get a network here

368
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,800
So I'm kind of pissed that the Virgin for some reason. I don't know they just don't have a

369
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,740
If they don't have a Rome I mean why don't pick up a network? It would that doesn't make sense that

370
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,980
Well, they just don't have a network that they roam with they be that is indeed the the

371
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,980
The problem what's that?

372
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,980
Yeah

373
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,560
I thought I heard some interference. I just put fresh batteries into the wireless set

374
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:33,460
So that shouldn't work fine for a while, but you know, I think if you've got a city where your airplane airplane's fly from

375
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,500
And Virgin Atlantic flies from San Francisco twice a day

376
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,780
Then perhaps it would be kind of smart to have

377
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,820
Your mobile telephones work in the city, but maybe it's just this particular area of the city. I don't know

378
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
So I want to talk to you bit

379
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,500
about

380
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,140
The future of radio and what I've learned what the feeling is from people

381
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,420
Particularly who are either in radio or a different forms of radio or

382
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:06,260
Or an advertising and advertised for radio and I think I can sum it up from our

383
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,580
Conversations in New York with and again advertising folks that I know

384
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,180
Radio people marketing people who sell sponsorships and advertising for radio

385
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,460
They're pretty much scared shitless

386
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,620
I can't say it any other way. Well, maybe not scared

387
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:31,340
Well, yeah, I think scared is probably the right word because they know they know and everyone who's in radio knows

388
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:38,740
That there is a whole generation coming up that does not give a shit about radio doesn't care doesn't listen and

389
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:46,460
You know, and we think about it. Well, yeah, that's my daughter. My daughter is part of that generation and anyone who has kids

390
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,100
And if they're let's say anywhere between like 11 and 14 or you know

391
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,460
If you got pre teenagers or teenagers and listen to radio the way you use to they've got a whole bunch of other things

392
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,460
They're doing they have MSN that they're on all day

393
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,180
They have their iPod that they're filling up and and maybe they're not even listening to podcasts

394
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,700
But they have an iPod that's how they're enjoying their entertainment. They've got an Xbox

395
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,900
You know, there's all this stuff that is basically detracting from and in this case

396
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,860
I'm just going to talk about radio, but because of course television has pretty much

397
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,500
You know the same issues and the people that do listen to radio

398
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,140
I think that they're pretty disenfranchised that's at least what we've you know what we've kind of in our

399
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,380
In our little informal studies have seen is that you know, wow

400
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,860
People are bored. They're running away

401
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,860
There's there's not a lot that they'd like to listen to everyone knows it's there and everyone has the radio on at some point

402
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,420
And it may be just a backdrop for for you know, like a soundtrack to your life

403
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,380
But you know that's what people are basically choosing to program themselves

404
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,820
You know setting up their own playlist and I have to say by the way

405
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,900
I don't think that many people use playlist features on MP3 players and to prove that

406
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,820
I guess or the proof would be in the pudding is why Apple came out with the shuffle

407
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,380
Because that is pretty much a thing what everyone was doing

408
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,700
And at the beginning you set up your playlist and of course you've got a playlist that is just right to get everyone in the mood for

409
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,460
Something sensual or something fun or if you want to pick me up or you know a rainy day

410
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,260
Played list, but after a while you get kind of tired of it because guess what it's like fucking work

411
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,260
You know

412
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,660
I

413
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,680
Actually once made a playlist generator. I should dig that code up. It was pretty cool

414
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,000
Cuz you know radio stations have have a format and the format is well first of all

415
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,240
There's probably a genre most radio stations have to have a genre

416
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,240
So we play the best of the 60 70's n80's everybody. Oh, we play today

417
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,800
Racking it or we play the light only the light or all talk all the time

418
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,920
But let's just take music for a second even within those formats. So let's take a

419
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,040
60 70's 80's mixed station or 70's 80's 90's or what is it 80's 90's and today?

420
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,600
So basically that could be my my iTunes or my my iPod could be 60 70's 80's 90's and today

421
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,160
But you know what it does a format do well a format is a clock

422
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,920
And if you would take a clock and split it up into sections let's say

423
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,360
Five minutes sections that would pretty much equal what just about every single radio station and on the planet has is their format

424
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,880
And oftentimes the format is of course a secret formula for success and no one really talks about their format

425
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,720
But a station may start off the top of the hour with a big hit golden old

426
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
And these are all tagged by the way in

427
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,120
Programs that radio stations use the most prevalent one is called selector and

428
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:51,440
They have all kinds of tags, you know, it's like if it's the tag would be female artists tag would be sunny song happy song up tempo

429
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
You know

430
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,040
Probably well obviously the the date range so there's a whole bunch of ways that that songs are tagged and I wish we could merge

431
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,480
some of the professional stuff that is out there

432
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,960
Into more like a prosumer version because all the all the study that on the stuff has been done, you know

433
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,320
It's it's all been developed. It's just in very expensive packages that we really can't access as podcasters

434
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
But so that format will say all right

435
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,160
We'll start off with a song from the 60s that we want to hit a

436
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,640
Recurrent which means something from the past five years then we want to go with an 80 song

437
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,120
And we'll do another 80s but a

438
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,880
A slow song and then from that slow song will go into an up tempo. So that would be the format and what I created

439
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,560
many years ago

440
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
Was I had all these tags. I'd basically tag my music

441
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,720
But I did it just simply first by a tempo and by a date range and

442
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Had a format which would say exactly that I want to start off with this type of song that song will be next

443
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
And please make sure that you don't repeat a song right so there's no repetition within the hour

444
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't repeat the artist and it would just delve into my iTunes and and pull out songs and create a

445
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,760
Format for me and it would start playing and when it was almost at the end of that playlist

446
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,400
It would create a new one so I basically had this automatic and this loop running throughout the house now on your iPod that's a little more complicated

447
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,720
But really, you know, who's gonna go through all that trouble of tagging their music and doing all that?

448
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,960
You know, it's it's not what you do is you put it on random and if it hit it the random hits the song

449
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,640
That you don't like you just you know hit the the the the the skip button and you go to the next one

450
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
So there's a big

451
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Big opportunity I think

452
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,680
How do we how do you even start on talking about this about the randomizing okay?

453
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,480
Well, so anyway, yeah people are randomized and creating their own stuff and and they're really

454
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,800
They're probably manipulating more than actually creating there's always die-hards

455
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,320
But I think the majority of people don't bother creating playlists

456
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
The point being that

457
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,640
Radio sees that it's in trouble now of course

458
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,360
Several years ago and I didn't even realize that this was like goes back to you know

459
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,720
Almost more than 10 years ago is when the satellite guy started to figure out this exact problem and

460
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,280
That you know, we they would have to figure something out to you know to be able to either offer more programming or different programming

461
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,360
Or and this is all pre iPods when they set up these satellite radio stations which is supposed to be the big alternative to

462
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
terrestrial radio broadcast

463
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
There were no iPods so they thought that they would be the shit. They would be the bomb digity and that how all these

464
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,440
You know these pre-programmed channels which would give you a format, you know very much like what we see

465
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
in our playlists

466
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,680
And of course those markets crossed each other and then they went oh shit, you know, we've got to come up with something else at the same time

467
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,840
I think the satellite guys also realized that you know users were defecting listeners didn't want to

468
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
Stick around anymore. They're bored of what they're hearing and

469
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
And

470
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,720
One of the biggest misnomers by the way if we it's of course obviously this comes into a Howard Stern conversation because radio can be all kinds of things

471
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,520
It's not just music. It's not just all talk. You know, it's it's radio is a technology. Okay. It's you can't put

472
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:16,240
Podcasts in a box and say this is a podcast, you know, there's this is a podcast and cover villas a podcast and a skinny on

473
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,040
Sports as a podcast and rock roll kick shows a podcast and match wine is a podcast and wine seems a podcast and Don and Drew is a podcast

474
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,680
Everything's a podcast. It's just a technology that's being used

475
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
And it can be a for profit podcast and not for profit podcast and none in

476
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
podcast, you know fucking understand

477
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,080
you know it's just a technology so

478
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,080
The big miss understanding I think about Howard Stern and of course I want to talk a little bit about his move to serious radio

479
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
is that

480
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,480
serious which has no

481
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,680
FCC regulations or not regulated by the FCC they are regulated interestingly enough by the digital millennium copyright act

482
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,200
Which gives them some other hurdles they have to address

483
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:08,240
Anything goes so you can say whatever you want essentially very much like a podcast because it's not regulated by the FCC

484
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,520
People who think that because Howard Stern now can say shit piss fuck tits count motherfucker cock sucker

485
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,480
Whatever the seven dirty words are that all of a sudden, you know, this is gonna be like some big

486
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,760
Revelation, you know other people are saying oh, you know, maybe he'll be like Lenny Bruce and once he gets all this freedom

487
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,960
People won't be as interesting anymore and I say nay to both, you know, this is not what Howard Stern is about Howard Stern is not about

488
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,960
Saying dirty words or or being indecent Howard Stern is about honesty and

489
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,920
This is something that I learned a long long long long time ago when I started first moved to New York

490
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,360
It started listening to him is that he would just he wouldn't put on the fake voice. He wouldn't you know

491
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,480
Pretend to be someone else although that is obviously always a bit questionable

492
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
for everybody me included

493
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,680
But he was just telling stories and telling talking about his life and and talking about stuff that interested him and and guess what?

494
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,440
You know in all honesty in all honesty many guys like to talk about

495
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,960
sex

496
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Is it a surprise to you

497
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,880
So if that's what people want to talk about and they can talk about it honestly and openly and use the words that I mean

498
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,360
Look life is indecent life is indecent

499
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,040
I've said this before the way we talk the way we communicate with each other are actions

500
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,320
What we write it just everything it's indecent by today's FCC standards

501
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,240
I don't think it's indecent I don't care what you say to me how you say it

502
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,360
But it is deemed indecent by the broadcast regulations

503
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,440
But it's nothing so it's not about the language it's about being honest and being able to say

504
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,160
Whatever's on your mind and starting a debate and if it's about lesbians that's fine

505
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,600
You know Howard Stern is not always about lesbians either

506
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,280
So I completely believe he will bring

507
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,720
An enormous following he has about eight million listeners now. He claims a bit more, but eight million

508
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,560
I'd say he's a pretty fair number across the US and he has to bring one million subscribers to

509
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,520
To serious and then they basically make make money. You know, he's making hundred million a year

510
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,760
If he brings in a million subscribers then they have then they're probably gonna do

511
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,320
Just on the Howard Stern deal. They're going to make a minimum of 20 to 30 million dollars a year

512
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,360
Pre-tax because Howard brings in enough to cover it up. You know a subscription to serious radio costs was at 12 or 14 bucks

513
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,000
12 bucks a month so you wind up paying 140 bucks so do that times a million want you

514
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,960
You see that you're at a hundred and forty million dollars and if Howard Stern cost a hundred so there's you know

515
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,000
30-40 million left over so that makes total sense

516
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
The question is

517
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,920
Since Howard Stern can't make the move until 2006

518
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:08,240
Will people start defecting to other avenues before then can they wait that long or are they finding that podcast or delivering a lot of

519
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
Because that's what I keep hearing people say over and over they say

520
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
I don't know why I listen to it

521
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,720
You know this person doesn't have a great voice or you know he says um and uh and the quality sucks and you know

522
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,600
What what is it it's about the honesty and please make no mistake. It's not about the amateurism of

523
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,840
The podcast that can be a part of the entire vibe and people don't really give a shit

524
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,480
I think that's what we're finding out you know it's like college radio

525
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,800
You know I don't give a shit if you if you crack the mic the wrong time

526
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,320
I just want to hear what you have to say and it's kind of funny you know and I think that

527
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,200
The amateurism and the unprofessionalism that you might hear once in a while or all the time

528
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,480
Doesn't matter whatever podcast you're listening to it. It's just it's exciting to hear something you haven't heard you know

529
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
so after a while after

530
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,680
we're all

531
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
You know we're used to listening to crappy

532
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,840
Non-professional podcast then the occasional one that is produced a little more slicker

533
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,160
Well, that'll be exciting. So that's just what we're used to

534
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,440
But it's about the honesty. It's about hearing people talking and and you can almost

535
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,800
Sense that they don't have to hold back. There's nothing in the back of their mind that they can't talk about

536
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
There's no you know corporate

537
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,600
I was like what we talked about the CBS

538
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,840
When I was interviewed by CBS for CBS evening news by the way

539
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:36,880
They're holding back on releasing that report. This is great because they they want to do the report about podcasting in conjunction with launching

540
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
CBS news is own podcast

541
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,320
I feel a bit used but it is kind of exciting so that'll be cool to see that happen

542
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
So

543
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,360
You can tell and that's what's getting everyone hooked on these things because

544
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,800
You know you can tell and of course after a while if it's not interesting or it's not entertaining and a tune out no matter what which is why you know

545
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,120
I keep my time in check. I don't want to do more than 40 minutes

546
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,920
I have my balls aren't big enough to say I think I can entertain you any longer than a 3040

547
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
30 or 40 minutes that I do every day

548
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,800
So in the conversations in New York we talked a lot about

549
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
ways to move

550
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Advertising money revenue

551
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,680
From radio where it wants to leave because the numbers are dwindling into new areas

552
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Now with serious it's an an XM I should mention them as well the two

553
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,880
Satellite radio networks in the U.S

554
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,920
They're doing a combination mainly subscription

555
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,120
But they will also be doing advertising and how it's turn will carry advertising as well

556
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,800
So you're going to pay a monthly fee and you'll be subject to advertising by the way

557
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,680
I don't have a problem with advertising. I like listening to it if you know I like

558
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Being marketed to I like hearing about new products if I don't then I'm gone. You know, so you can lose me really easy

559
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,000
But it's not you know, I've nothing against advertising. It's a fact of life. You know

560
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,480
So there are people looking to to move into the new market now. We don't really have

561
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,880
The eight million listeners that Howard Stern has you know, we don't you know, I have

562
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,480
What we up to like you know, well we're well over the 50,000 mark that I had several months ago

563
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,760
But you know, it's still if if you look at it, you know, they use something called a cost per thousand CPM cost per meal

564
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,280
To determine you know how much is paid per

565
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Per advertisement and that's just not going to work. That's like you're trying to shoehorn the wrong thing and to you know

566
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,680
It's kind of like what happened with banner ads, you know, and now

567
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,880
You know, all everyone cares about the banner banners of the same size and it's just it's it's

568
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,480
It's not very innovative. It's not the best use. I think of you know now we have all this freedom

569
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,360
We can do it every one what a revolutionary concept

570
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,840
Maybe we could make commercials interesting and not having be just 10 20 or 30 seconds maybe we can integrate them into

571
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,560
Into programming and I've really and I've really thought about how and and that was part of my point of being out here in San Francisco

572
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:19,840
I want to talk to a lot of the top podcasters and get their feeling for you know, what are they looking for and and what's been interesting is

573
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,040
I've been talking to a lot of people out here on the west coast

574
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,440
Every single person wants to make money on what they're doing

575
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,400
I think everyone's very realistic and understand that it's no one's going to be making a

576
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
billion dollars in any type of

577
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,880
You know any type of new media venture just because

578
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
You know the numbers it doesn't add up, you know

579
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
It's unlike the old

580
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,960
centralized model where you'll have a few people who have all the viewers and all the listeners now

581
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,600
We have a much larger scope where you're going to have your 15 listeners or your 150 or maybe your

582
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,480
5000 you know it all depends on what you're doing and obviously the more

583
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,080
People that are in there the more interesting will be for advertising but it's not just about advertising because we you know

584
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
I've been testing a couple models

585
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,080
I have to say that I am just tickled pink about this whole San Seo deal

586
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,880
So, you know, here's a way you to make money with a podcast

587
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,760
You like something and you talk about it and then all you have to do is make sure you give people an opportunity to check out that product and go buy it

588
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
I like lots of stuff

589
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
And actually what I've noticed with the Amazon associates

590
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,840
You know, I'm gonna associate with Amazon and I've been talking about the San Seo coffee maker because I like it

591
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,680
I use it. It's a great product. I wish I had it here with me on the road and by the way

592
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,360
I thank you everyone so much for all the emails and the pointers on how to create your own coffee pods and

593
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,680
Fill them up with other things besides coffee

594
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,440
Next time I'm an Amsterdam. I'll be sure to create a really big pod that I'm gonna try it out

595
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,320
You know, and people are interested, you know, look at coffee futures

596
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,160
You know coffee is a big ass market lots and lots and lots of people drink coffee. So

597
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,760
I'm talking about something as a product. I don't even make, you know, if I made the product it would probably be better and if my podcast was only about coffee

598
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,120
I would probably sell more of them but just through the fact that I'm talking about this great coffee machine that I like that I use

599
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,760
And I want you to be able to have the same wonderful San Seo coffee pod experience

600
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,920
You can go to curie.com

601
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,960
Click on the on the picture of the coffee machine and you'll be able to buy it now because you buy something

602
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,880
I get a percentage and right now I'm beginning like five percent or something, you know, that's Amazon's deal

603
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,040
So I'm not really feeling extremely happy but what if it were my product? What if it were my CD?

604
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,040
Like the lascivious bitties. They're gonna be doing their bitty cast. It's already started. So

605
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,480
They're gonna be talking about themselves and on the road and you'll get hooked or you won't get hooked and

606
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,160
And you'll want to buy the CD. It's just the way it works, you know, it's on television. They have a word for it

607
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,000
It's called an infomercial now of course that conjures up all kinds of images of really bad actors and

608
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:01,200
Overdubbed voices of you know with beautiful bodies who have these wonderful machines that could make you as tone and fit as well

609
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,320
But it is a bit that's very successful, you know for companies that make or or

610
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:14,800
Market those products so very much I guess I have to admit like what Dave Weiner has said many times on how to make money on weblobs

611
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:21,920
Only now it kind of you know we've opened up this whole new area of of creativity and opportunity for people who just aren't writers

612
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,640
I'm not a I'm not a writer. I'm not a good writer. I'm a shitty writer. I don't you know, just don't I'm not good at it

613
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,440
I always fire stuff off and just post it up to the blog

614
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,800
I don't really think about it and go back later and think oh, I could have committed that better

615
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,800
This is my my arena. I love doing this. I love doing audio. I love talking. I love experimenting with it

616
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,480
a lot of construction going on today by the way. You probably hear that in the background

617
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
So there's

618
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,520
There's ways that will be able to do that and we need some infrastructure obviously to make that happen

619
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,800
So that if you have an idea and you want a podcast first we should make the podcasting part pretty easy you know

620
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,040
How about just click record click done

621
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,360
Or pick up the phone and call a number and hit pound and it's done and you've got your feet and you've got your your archive and and show notes

622
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,440
This is going to be important show notes is going to be important. I'm really happy that I started out by

623
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,680
Doing it in OPML even though it's really had it's made no sense up until now

624
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,880
But a lot of people are doing it and I really appreciate you following along

625
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
Because

626
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:35,200
The next thing that's going to happen is we're going to have to be able to find stuff based upon the content inside the podcast

627
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,600
So you know these directories like we have at ipod.org and other ones that kind of take the ID3 tag information

628
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,880
It's not going to be enough

629
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,640
We have to add extra metadata to the podcast in order to make them indexable searchable

630
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Got a couple of ideas about that

631
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,240
And then on the sponsoring sponsoring advertising. I think are two different things

632
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,320
And I've been listening around to a couple of podcasts my my favorite example is WGBH in Boston

633
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,520
WGBH a WGBH is morning stories are sponsored by ipswitch and ipswitch is a

634
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,880
Provider of downloading tools connectivity

635
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,240
It sounds like a provider. I'm not quite sure but I remember the name right and

636
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,240
So in a perfect NPR model which to me just sounds like it's commercial

637
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,760
I don't see any difference between this program brought to you by ipswitch for morning stories or you know this program brought to you by

638
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,680
MS mobiles for Don and Drew. I don't see any difference there, but apparently there, you know, it's I guess there is

639
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,640
Maybe because the show maybe that's a throwback to the to the good old days where if a show is interrupted by

640
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,400
Commercials then it's a commercial show but if it's sponsored by the beginning in the end and you're not

641
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,000
And you're not interrupting the flow of the program then it's not commercial

642
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,720
So anyway, I'd call that sponsoring or underwriting and we're seeing lots of that happen already and I and I and I encourage that and what you're gonna get is you're gonna get people who are specifically

643
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:12,640
Underwriting a podcast for the content of the podcast or the audience that will be listening to that to that podcast and it's like you don't really need numbers to prove it

644
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,240
Because the sponsor intuitively knows

645
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,880
The people that I'm gonna reach there are the ones that I want to reach because it's just clear

646
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,080
It's not based upon the shotgun approach of I've got 8 million listeners, so you know

647
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,640
You just want to buy a spot with me because you're just blasting it out and you're always gonna get someone you want

648
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,600
There is a way to do that by the way, and I'm not against it. I think it's a very

649
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,960
Interesting idea, but we have to bond together and this is the long tail that people talk about you know

650
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,680
So we'll have if we have a couple hundred podcasters just like the you

651
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,720
Weblogs, so there's a couple weblogs that everyone knows about and get get shit loads of traffic

652
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,520
But then there's this millions of weblogs that all get little 80 bit of bits of part of of traffic

653
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,360
And if you can find it if we can find a way collectively to

654
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,640
Use each of those smaller audiences to aggregate them into a big audience

655
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,360
That will create something that the advertisers who understand the shotgun approach and that's what they like to do

656
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
It was just you know fucking load on baby

657
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
We'll get someone

658
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,680
We can do that. We can totally do that. So I think a combination

659
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,640
By him I have to say most excited about

660
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,000
Being able to talk about a product or maybe just you know going to a store how about that

661
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,800
You know if you just if you just go into an online store and say I really like that product and I want to sell that

662
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,240
I want to advertise that we could turn this whole fucking thing around think about that so instead of

663
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,360
You determining you know saying okay, you can come and advertise with your cell phone, right?

664
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
So the virgin mobile

665
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,160
Says I want advertising your show. Why don't I

666
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Have an opportunity to go to some place

667
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,280
Where I can go through a whole bunch of products and services or I can search for one that I perhaps like already and know that I want to talk about

668
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:07,120
Because I'm passionate about it if I like something or a particular cigar that I smoked and go and get

669
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,840
The the automatic right to market that product that would turn it all upside down and then the

670
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:19,360
The longer I'm on this plan at the more I'm seeing in recent years that if you turn the model upside down

671
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,280
It's usually exactly what people are looking for

672
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,320
I don't know why but it seems that way it's like you know instead of streaming

673
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
We're gonna do

674
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,800
We're gonna do caching basically and put stuff on your on your machine that you don't know about and tell you about it later

675
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,760
I mean everything if you turn the paradigm upside down it usually starts to make sense in our new world

676
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,480
And so I'm pretty excited about that idea of just being able to go into it into an online store

677
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,200
Choose a product that I like or search for the product that I like and as I talk about it on my podcast

678
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,440
Send people back to my website my weblog whatever wherever I post my podcast and say, hey, you know click on

679
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,720
Click on that link and get some more information about it or buy it, you know, then all I'm doing is I'm just I

680
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:04,480
Become the market or the advertiser and I determine what I'm going to sell and I can hone my skills with my advertising message

681
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,600
To my audience like Michael Butler

682
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,600
He had did a sponsorship or a commercial someone

683
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
I think I think they were basically going to give him free beer

684
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,680
Which is fine? That's that's what Michael wants right now. You want some free beer

685
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,320
Heinrich and you idiots you idiots

686
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
You know talk about that later

687
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,800
And he on the spot he made up a song and sang it for him and that was it, you know because he knows how to talk to his audience

688
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,920
To anyway hey let's play some pod save music and I still want to do the hit you know what or

689
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,840
I'm going to save the pod save music because we're 38 minutes already. It is time once again everybody for the hit

690
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
The answer that is test 10 bucks. I got your answers

691
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Time for Adam Curry to take the hit test

692
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
With y'all polette

693
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,000
Hi Adam. Hey on it's time for hit test number 13. I'm ready my brother again. There are some changes

694
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,640
Okay, in the format the clips are very short. You'll you'll hear each clip two times

695
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,800
And right after you'll have five seconds to think about it. Oh, here we go. There's clip number one

696
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
And once again number one

697
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
And how are you gonna five seconds to think about it

698
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,720
Okay, I don't like this new format young. I'm not good at it. Time for number two

699
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Once again number two

700
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,720
Sounds like a Mr. Mr. Okay, five seconds for you

701
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,680
And sound like Mr. Mr. But again, and this is number three

702
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,280
It's very short one more time

703
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,240
Okay hold on hold on all right young

704
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,000
This sucks at least I suck. I can't finish five seconds for you to think about it

705
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,880
My goodness, you know when I hear these songs I'm going to say oh, yeah, I knew what it was right it's too early

706
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,240
Maybe for me and I would start for the answer section number one

707
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,640
It's gross, but that's a 90s soft. I don't know so much about the 90s, you know, I need some old fit

708
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,200
Okay, I would never guess that even if you played it for an hour

709
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,520
And the second answer in today's hit justice

710
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,040
This curiosity killed the cats. Oh, man

711
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,560
This is down to earth. Okay, I could have known that that's like 83

712
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Song

713
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Me

714
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
And the third and final answer

715
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
It's a richy family

716
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,440
With me a break and cowbell to boot

717
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160

Yumpolets got his hit test podcast going check them out

732
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,040
Yumpolet.nl thank you very much yum. No, I think it's great the four minus great

733
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,120
Could I have ten seconds or so two things one I'd like ten seconds to think about it

734
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,520
And the clue well first of all, I wouldn't have gotten these I a curiosity killed the cap

735
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,960
Nost and my brain is too fried for that richy family

736
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,880
It wasn't one I mean because you know what I know so many songs because I've played so many songs

737
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,760
Over and over and over again on the radio and that's just one that you know, I've never played curiosity killed a cat

738
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
I could have known and

739
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
What was the I even forgot the first

740
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,280
So now I just suck this time, but give me yeah give me like ten seconds in between that's great

741
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,400
I love the I love hearing you know the snipers the the snip's

742
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
twice in a row

743
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,760
What's always hard though is to is the clues of the hardest things because you want people to be able to guess

744
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,760
You want to have you know give me a little bit of a chance

745
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,560
I we did this on the radio back in the 80s mood play like just like just like a

746
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,440
Not even a second worth of audio and people would still get it so I think the length of the clips are good

747
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,480
I just yeah, and I just suck what can I say I'm looking forward to tomorrow's though

748
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,080
