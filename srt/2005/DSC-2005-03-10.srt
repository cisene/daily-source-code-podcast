00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Daily source code, March 10th, 2005.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh boy, we got some stuff to talk about today.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm probably already overmodulating in your headphones because of it.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm not gonna be, yeah.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let me adjust a little bit here. There we go, that should work.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's the source code for March 10th, 2005.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm actually pretty pleased with myself.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've been doing dual duty today, working with an entire team of lawyers who were in court

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
on my behalf today. That was interesting.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I always run the know that lawyers are talking to each other.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Both parties of lawyers are building you.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But also I worked on my setup here at the cottage.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You've almost had castle. It's starting to feel a bit like the castle.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
All this gear all over the place.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So we're talking about the setup.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I got, you know, a mashup lined up and just normal stuff to talk about.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And it was during preparations for today's show that I noticed that I really had no more promos.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And I guess tomorrow will be my big suck to Gmail account dry day.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, that's second. Let me just ensure that I'm not gonna turn off the recording here.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So I hope you're enjoying the sound.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I've worked on this most of the day trying to figure out different ways to route audio.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And I have completely resorted to using outboard gear, which means boxes that are not native to software.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Although just about everything that I purchased certainly does integrate perfectly with my max running OS 10.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And if you hold on, I'll be happy to tell you all about it.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
First, let's crank it up with a mashup for you off.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I mean, just easy top by themselves and be crying, right?

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But now sprinkle a little bit of pink on top.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You've got the sharp dress party on this daily source curve.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000

So I hope you're enjoying the sound.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So I hope you're enjoying the sound.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,120
It's an unfortunate sharp dress party that was ZZU top versus pink here on the daily source code.

69
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,400
And hopefully you heard the sound was like kind of consistent now for the first time.

70
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,760
Let's talk about that.

71
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,080
First of all about my test yesterday.

72
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,240
I did the new mobile test where I jacked the iPod and the microphone together into a

73
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,880
single wire splitter that went into the iRiver as a recording device.

74
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,200
It actually worked okay.

75
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,960
I mean the sound was reasonably shitty on the microphone and sounded a bit overmodulated

76
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,160
and just wasn't quite coming through right.

77
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,680
But it also brought down the output volume significantly.

78
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,800
Until of course the iPod turned off and then, well, I got a lot of emails like the

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,480
following one.

80
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,440
This is from Axel.

81
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,160
Hello Adam, please refer to your regular hardware setup.

82
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,880
Please, I listened to the daily source code via my power book hooked up to my stereo

83
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
home cinema setup.

84
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,280
I thought my speakers were going to explode.

85
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,640
Please don't do this anymore.

86
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,440
It really sucks.

87
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
It really does.

88
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,480
One of the things that made daily source code stand out or did until yesterday was it's

89
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,280
a good broadcast quality.

90
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,640
Okay, so I do apologize.

91
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,000
It was, yeah, I was just kind of messing around and testing it out and that clearly

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,400
didn't work out too well.

93
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,000
Everybody complained about it.

94
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,160
So the morning after I dropped Christina off at school, I'd already done my homework

95
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,480
and checked out their website.

96
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,320
I went to Anderton Music, which is a really great music store in Guildford, not far from

97
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,200
Christina's school, actually, which was nice.

98
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,560
I went in and I bought, first of all, I bought a whole bunch of cables that match the

99
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,880
three and a half inch jack, the six inch jack, or whatever.

100
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,040
All mixes and matches of different types of wires and connectors.

101
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,560
In the music world, or in the professional audio world, they use different jacks than we

102
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,160
use on our computers and our headphones.

103
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,600
So I just needed some, you know, some adapter plugs.

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:12,880
Then I also purchased a soundcraft compact 4 mixer, which is, I had, I had spec this

105
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
one out before.

106
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,280
I looked at this mixer, I'm using it in a very simple setup, basically I'm just pumping

107
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,240
the microphone in and that is coming straight out, but it's better than any other mic

108
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,520
in version that I've used, you know, I use the breakout box.

109
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,200
These breakout boxes, even the fire wire, they just don't cut it because you get this

110
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,720
latency and this latency builds up and you just, you know, you just can't get rid of it

111
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,280
unless you, you know, re-regrab the interface and it just becomes unbearable after a bit.

112
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,960
In fact, doing the Patricia Pride podcast, it took us a good 20 minutes to set up and get

113
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,640
the levels right so that Patricia would actually, could bear having the headphones on,

114
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,640
listening to herself talk, she said, you know, it's slowing me down and it is.

115
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,400
I got used to it and, you know, now that I, that is gone, and I'll tell you how I solve

116
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,360
that, I'm really digging it.

117
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,840
So here's what I've done.

118
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,080
Here's how I've set it up and there's more gear to come because now I'm starting to

119
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,400
get the hang of all this and I'm getting pretty excited.

120
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:24,120
Basically, I have my wireless mic, the receiver is going into one input, a mono channel

121
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,000
on this mixer and the mixer is outputting a stereo signal which I'm putting into the line

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
in of my power book.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,400
Now I had, why did I differently earlier today, where the output of my power book was

124
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,360
routed through the mixer as well and so I could play back stuff, anything on the computer

125
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
that I wanted to and then I could mix the microphone and that audio signal, I actually had my

126
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,160
iPod hooked up to it as well.

127
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,880
I could mix those together.

128
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,080
Now what happened is I really started to miss the signal processing.

129
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,360
You know, I work so hard on getting the reverb just right and, and, and getting the

130
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,200
equalizing just sounding right and a little bit of compressor and I've got all these great

131
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,240
effects in the computer that I'm affecting, I can't use in that setup.

132
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,240
So I'm piping the microphone now into the, as I said, into the line in through the

133
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,240
mixing board and I'm just using the hijack feature of audio hijack pro so that I can

134
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,240
use all of their effects and basically put a chain together and the music of hijack

135
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,240
that, as well, basically hijacked the line input and of hijacked the, the quick time

136
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,840
player which I used to play my, my little clips of audio or mashups and so I've been

137
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,960
able to process them both individually which is really nice and the recording I'm doing

138
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
on my iRiver.

139
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,400
I've decided this is a great recorder, because you just gobs and gobs of time, 17 hours

140
00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:01,640
to record it very high quality sample rate and so basically it's just recording the,

141
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,640
it's getting its, it's input from the headphone jack on the power book and I just tried

142
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,280
out where I brought a Skype call in and I hijacked the Skype application as well so

143
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,280
I can process that so and then I, I can do VU meters for each individual channel so it's

144
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,120
finally starting to look and feel like a studio and that for a, you know, like a $100

145
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,680
mixer so I'm very, very happy with this setup currently and I'll keep you in the loop

146
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,400
on what I, I might even go for some external effects on the microphone that might be something

147
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,200
I could do, that might be cool.

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,640
Actually, I'll just give you a little demo here, hold on, let me decouple from the headset.

149
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:50,680
So I can actually turn this microphone off and now I have the other microphone on which

150
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,880
is my sure.

151
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,400
I need a mic stand for the sure so I can use it while I'm sitting down on the couch

152
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,680
so that's why I'm not using it today so I'm just using the, the lovelier so I'm

153
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,720
going to switch back to the lovelier, okay, I could make some, I just have it set up so

154
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,320
I could hit a button that turns the entire channel off so are we, are we recording now

155
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
is it working?

156
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Hold on.

157
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,800
Hello, hello, hello, hello, yeah, okay, good.

158
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,240
So very pleased with this, with this current setup, I'm loving the no lag feature, that's

159
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,720
really, it really makes a difference, you know, I got to be honest, it makes a difference,

160
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
not having that.

161
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Looks like we're still going to be moving towards external gear and I have received

162
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,080
hundreds, literally, hundreds of URLs to different portable mixers and there's about

163
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,480
three of them that pretty much do the job of just being portable, being able to add a

164
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,000
sound source and a microphone and then out.

165
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,240
So I could now essentially take my wireless microphone, my iPod and my I River and I could

166
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,240
do, and a mixer, a little mixer and I could do a complete mobile podcast, but of course

167
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,120
it's completely stupid because it should all be contained in one device, this would

168
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,240
just be one device that says here, give me, you know, jam a microphone in here or use

169
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,120
the built-in mic and if you want, you can mix in another line input, so if you want to

170
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,720
hook up an external sound source, but you can also write there from the interface, mix

171
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
in and be three.

172
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,640
I mean, it's software, I know it can be done, it's just, you know, I don't think we can,

173
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,160
we can't do it on the iPod because we don't know how to write software for it.

174
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,800
Maybe the Linux guys will get there eventually, but I think it's still quite a ways off,

175
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,840
but that's what we would need and it would be just perfect, you know, if we could do that,

176
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
really would.

177
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:48,280
So I haven't had the opportunity to email everybody back to thank them for all the links

178
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,520
to these portable mixers, there's quite a bit out there and, you know, the more I look

179
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:58,760
at it, the more I'm convinced that we will definitely be working with, you know, professional

180
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,040
sound gear from music stores like Anderton and Gilford, you know, that's, it's just

181
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,240
where they've got the stuff, they've got most of the stuff we need.

182
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,080
So I was even considering, I think I just said that, you know, buying an external effects

183
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,240
bank, I don't know, I'm just going to play around.

184
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:20,200
I really want to, you know, just get the best sound possible and I love the, the lavalier

185
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,240
microphone because it does give you a lot more ambience of the room, which I think a lot of

186
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,680
people like, you know, if you, probably just a shut up for a second here and I can actually

187
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:37,640
crank up the volume, you can even hear the TV downstairs, I would so loud know that my

188
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:45,400
mic is almost getting feet, I have a feedback on my ear buds, anyway, okay, so we're back.

189
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,080
Okay, so I did the mixers, oh, you were say today article, actually I should grab that,

190
00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:00,600
we can talk about it and now that I'm not recording on the Mac itself, that's going to be a lot

191
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:10,680
easier. Because the processor isn't so overloaded that I can almost, I can just probably

192
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:18,760
end up with it in no life. I can use my, my browser, nothing slowing down and it's all just

193
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:27,480
happily recording away on the I River IFP 799. So the, what does it, music fans reach for the

194
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,840
stars? It's a pretty long article, but I guess kind of the gist of it is that what's happening

195
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:42,360
online and what's happening through file sharing and what's happening through, you know, groups like

196
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,680
what is it, association of music podcasting, the independent music feeds, you know, we've got

197
00:15:50,680 --> 00:16:00,280
accident hash, we've got in some near radio, 300 with a $250 million radio show. I mean, there's

198
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,640
all these different independent outlets and podcasting, of course, is going to really, you know,

199
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:12,760
grab a hold in that arena that it's becoming more influential than MTV and, you know, kids are

200
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,200
making decisions on what they want to buy based upon different recommendations, you know, it's not,

201
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,840
it's not just the traditional channels, so there's a lot going on here, I'm really excited about that

202
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,880
because I'm pretty sure in the new venture, I've been telling you a bit about, that's one of the things

203
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,760
that I really look forward to, is helping people like, like the listidious bitty, you know, it's

204
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,440
perfect and I've, I've already been kind of doing some of that with them, you know, they're going

205
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,640
to be going out on tour soon. I actually did a South, was at SWSX, that's where they are right now

206
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:52,360
and they're doing their podcast and they're selling music through their, you know, which they're

207
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,640
retaining, you know, a large portion of the direct revenue. I mean, it's, it's really a good system.

208
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:07,000
We're getting to something here and, and, and mainstream media is starting to take notice,

209
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,880
which I guess is something they should be doing, so I'm just pretty, pretty jazzed about all that.

210
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,160
So you got an email here from Eric, Eric says, hey man, just curious, what exactly you do?

211
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,200
I just got into podcasting, you've heard that heard about you, so I've been listening lately,

212
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,520
but what is your daily job or career? I just started listening, can't really figure it out.

213
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,760
I'm on your site right now as well, and I'm trying to see what you do. I think you develop software

214
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,880
I potter, I believe, but just curious. Well, Eric or Eric, it's a CH is the way you spell it, Eric.

215
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,680
Um, well, first of all, thank you. I, uh, it's very, very nice of you to think of me as a software developer.

216
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,520
That's great. Um, my entire claim to fame is the iPodder script, so I think I appreciate it.

217
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:02,280
But no, I, um, I don't actually, this is all I'm doing right now. I, um, I had a, my previous

218
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,640
company, well, I had a couple companies in between with my previous company in the United States. I sold in

219
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:16,440
1999 with my partner, Ron Bloom, and, uh, you know, semi retired, although I, I was working on a lot of

220
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,320
similar stuff, actually, the podcasting, but completely in video and, uh, based on job-a-platform.

221
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,600
So what I did then was basically burn a lot of money. I've burned a lot of money in helicopters too.

222
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,240
But, um, you know, since, uh, July or August, um, this is what I've been doing, and I'm a radio geek

223
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,760
from way back. So I've been doing lots of radio, and this is so right up my alley, you know, the first

224
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,280
day I saw an internet connection. I said, ah, that's something we can broadcast over. And it was at the

225
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,760
wired rave awards that I hooked up with Carl Jacob, who I knew, uh, back then he contacted me

226
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:59,240
he was working at Sun Microsystems. And we actually, uh, started, uh, on ramp, uh, in the very,

227
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,120
very early days together. And he was out in San Francisco and, uh, the servers were in his apartment.

228
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:13,720
And, uh, I think it was when the 9600, uh, bought modems rolled around, that he, um,

229
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:23,000
transmitted an audio signal via the PCM codec, uh, from San Francisco to my, um, my home in New Jersey,

230
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,200
where I had a 64K frame relay connection, I believe, um, and it actually worked, you know, it was,

231
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,280
of course it was a single stream and it was really inefficient and it was pumping the bit straight

232
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,480
through, nothing like, you know, what, uh, it will not much later after that. We, uh, saw things like

233
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,680
was it progressive networks, which later became a real audio. Um, and, uh, you know, we were just

234
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,880
thinking back to, uh, to those days and now, you know, look at, look at what's happening. This is just so

235
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,200
incredibly amazing. That's what I said the other day when I realized that I was talking into a

236
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:03,160
little stick of plastic, like a, the size of a cheese stick, a cheese snack and knowing that after,

237
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,200
you know, a little bit of messing around on a keyboard and, uh, you know, some file transfers and

238
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,640
some clicking of the, the mouse that, uh, all these people would be able to hear this, you know, that's,

239
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:21,080
uh, that's definitely part of a dream come true. It's really, yeah, it's, uh, I'm digging it.

240
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,840
So anyway, so what am I doing now? Well, I'll tell you one of the things I'm working on,

241
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,920
is I'm working on getting the Gilmore gang back on the air because my weekends have been total

242
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,680
crap without the gang. Um, I'm, um, really, you know, I'm like totally bogged out about this. I've been

243
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:41,160
talking to Steve Gilmore, um, you know, have also been telling him a bit about our plans. And, uh, so

244
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,360
help me, uh, I want to get the Gilmore gang back on the air very, very, very, very, very quickly.

245
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,240
This is the hit test podcast. Yeah, test podcast featuring the hit test, heard on the daily source

246
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,800
codes. Hey, who are you on? Hold it. All right.

247
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,360
This is the opener of the hit test podcast. I'm working with a weekly podcast featuring an extended

248
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:08,040
version of the hit test with five intros for you to identify. And of course, I will be talking about

249
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,800
my favorite subjects. And that would be me. So check it out. Hey, y'all, let's dot to know that

250
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,400
J and P.O.L. E.G. doesn't help. And I'll just see you for the next hit test podcast. All right.

251
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,280
Time for Adam Curry to take the hit test. My goodness. I'm already tired.

252
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,760
Well, I Adam, this hit test number 21. Hey, uh, and this is the last time I will mention the number

253
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,040
because it's like it's very interesting for the listeners. Whoa.

254
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,760
What keep you proud? Uh, you're able to identify which hit test it is by looking at the file name.

255
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,960
So that will be enough. All right. This is number one. Okay. Here we go.

256
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:02,520
Once again. I got it. But I'm about to get ready. Okay. That's talking in your sleep by the romantic.

257
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,800
And this is number two.

258
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,120
Oh, once again. It sounds like a hairband ballads.

259
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,000
Wow. Now you've got me on that one, y'all. I'm definitely stumped. And the final one. Number three.

260
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,680
One more time. Try.

261
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,680
Oh, man.

262
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,920
Y'all. I think you've stumped me. I only got one out of three as far as I know.

263
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,680
Time for the answers. This is answer number one. Okay. That was romantic. That was romantic.

264
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:07,160
I'm here. The secret facts to keep talking in your sleep.

265
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
All right. Let's get to the number two.

266
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,640
Here it is now. And answer number two.

267
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,040
What was Boston? Oh, and a sunny styled Amanda.

268
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,560
Oh, but of course.

269
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Oh, but it's the intro. It's like all our members, the decor. It's a nice, solid, sweet.

270
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,640
Can you read the man?

271
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Okay, not entirely a hairband, so.

272
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,560
And Amanda is number two in today's hit test.

273
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
And this is answer number three.

274
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,400
It's an oldie by Sharon Brown.

275
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,600
I specialize in love. Oh, Jesus, you're kidding me. Oh, I never want to pray that.

276
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
I love this song.

277
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:40,600
Yeah, and this is really my kind of music specialized in love. Sharon Brown.

278
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Well, this concludes the hit test for today.

Let us see you next time for another edition of the hit test. Bye-bye.

283
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
All right, buddy. Thank you very much.

284
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,880
Young Polette with his infamous hit test.

285
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:20,680
Well, what we're going to talk about. Oh, yes, I want to demonstrate the Skype phone to you.

286
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:29,320
I ordered this cordless telephone, which you hook up to a PC. Of course, it only works on a PC.

287
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,760
So I hook it up downstairs on the Christina's PC. And basically, it gives you a Skype,

288
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,840
it hooks up to your Skype account. So you have to be online with Skype.

289
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,240
And when someone calls you, it rings like a telephone. You pick it up and you use it like a telephone.

290
00:25:49,800 --> 00:26:00,360
Which is just really fucking cool. And if you use it to call out, then you can go to the

291
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,240
phone book and it shows you all of your contacts that are online. You can scroll through and just hit

292
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,640
the dial button and it'll call them. Or you of course can use Skype out. So I immediately set

293
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,720
Patricia up with a Skype out account. And now she's calling all over the world that these wonderful

294
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,120
rates, which is a penny and a half per minute, which is just unbelievable. I mean, that price is

295
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:29,160
that's cheap. That's really dirt cheap. And now she's hooking up her sister's getting hooked up.

296
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,400
And once she's got Skype installed and all working, then we send her one of these Skype phones.

297
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,720
And then it can just basically call like they're using a telephone. And with this particular model,

298
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,760
you can plug it into the regular phone line. And you can choose which phone line you want to use,

299
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,240
and it'll ring for both for both incoming calls. So I'm telling you, man, Skype is going to be the

300
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,000
phone company. It's just amazing. I want to demo this to you. So how should I do this?

301
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Well, first link, I'll tell you what, why don't I call downstairs, Christina's probably on the phone.

302
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,920
So let's just listen to the quality of it. Okay, I'm hijacking Skype now. And I'm going to ask,

303
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,960
this of course is a big, I'm going to ask Christina to come upstairs with the extension. You never know if a

304
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,960
teenager will do that, right? But let's see. So it should be ringing. Oh, it was ringing.

305
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,960
Hello. Hey, Sparky. Hey, Dad. Hey, I'm doing a podcast. I wanted to test the Skype phone.

306
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,040
Oh, what works. Yeah. Well, can you do me a humongous favor? Sure. Would you mind coming

307
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:45,480
upstairs and bringing the handset with you? Why? Well, so I can demo it. I want to let people here

308
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,000
the ring. All right. Hey, Dad. What do I have a whole bunch of people on my Skype list with the name

309
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,440
Gothenett? Uh, with the name Gothenett? On your Skype list? That's Mom's Skype list.

310
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:08,600
Yeah, I have no idea. Oh, my God. The name Gothenett? All these jeans and stuff in it.

311
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,480
I don't know. I'll take a look later, but you can just close that window. That should just be closed.

312
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,040
All right. Bring the phone. You want me to bring the whole thing with the plug?

313
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,840
No, no, no. Just you're on the phone now, right? Yeah. Yeah, no, just bring the phone up. Just walk

314
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,040
up and talk to me while you're walking. So I can hear you walk up the stairs. The sound is great. It's just like

315
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,880
a real phone, isn't it? Yep. Well, it kind of sounds like you're in a cave, like the back cave.

316
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,400
But it's all right. Oh, is this any better? Wait a minute. You're listening to me. I don't even know

317
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,400
how you're hearing me. Who knows? Oh, here you are. Hello. Hi. Oh, there's a little delay, isn't there?

318
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,880
Yeah. Yeah, hold on one second. Hang up. Okay, hang up. Okay. Now, I want to call you just so people can hear the ring.

319
00:28:51,880 --> 00:29:04,120
Hold on. Take up. What's up? Cool. Okay. That was a thanks baby. All right.

320
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:19,160
I love you. Oh, can you close my door? My gosh. Thanks. Five. There you go. The Skype phone.

321
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Inaction sounded pretty damn hot, didn't it? And, you know, the Skype out feature is just it's great. I love it.

322
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,240
And I haven't looked at the book yet, but I'm sure there's a way to even do the conference calls. And

323
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,320
oh, man, it's just so smart. And, you know, these guys are just cell and phone minutes. You know,

324
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,680
it's working. I totally, totally dig it. Hey, you got another mashup lined up for you. It's actually,

325
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,680
it's not a, it's not really a mashup more than like, well, it is, it is kind of a mashup. You know what?

326
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,920
It's not just a mashup. It's the king.

327
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,640
Give me another start.

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,100
And see, I think that we may even do another Patricia Pi podcast, I've kind of been

339
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,100
hinting that people like it so much, and I haven't received a couple of songs through

340
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:05,100
email MP3s and a like of stuff that Patricia has done in the past, and I think we'll

341
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,100
be a big surprise to her.

342
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
What's going on?

343
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Yes.

344
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,100
The joke contains an old content that is brought to you by the letter 8.

345
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Yes.

346
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Yes.

347
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,100
This is the whip report.

348
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Now, why am I going to play this for you?

349
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,100
I thought I couldn't sound welcome to the show.

350
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,100
This is the whip report on your host, my name is Whiplash.

351
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,100
Coming up later, an exclusive whip report first interview with Murphy, and how he

352
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
was about having his own law.

353
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:45,100
The interview goes okay, but if something can go wrong, it probably will.

354
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Later, we'll chat with a man who has convinced that two poxikours are Jewish holiday.

355
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
First, at these top stories.

356
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
You should listen to that, the whip report.

357
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
Find it on ipotter.org.

358
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Hey, by the way, the directory, I saw that Marcus was working on the static rendering, so the

359
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,100
directory is going to be a lot faster now.

360
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Just about every single node has now been distributed, which is just great.

361
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:13,100
I'm still working on getting some people's opml working a little bit better, and pretty soon

362
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,100
I'm going to put in some interesting stuff for the node managers.

363
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I'm going to give you a couple more tools to work with, so you can really build out the node.

364
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:29,100
And there's also going to be some money making opportunities.

365
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,100
But that's for another podcast, my friends.

366
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:39,100
