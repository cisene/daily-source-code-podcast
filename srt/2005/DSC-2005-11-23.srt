1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You know the weird guy in the corner of the office who always has his headphones on?

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's you!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hot show!

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Been the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And no everybody how you're doing come and you from Curry Cottage in the affluent series

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
about some sort of suburb of Gilford with the source code kicking it off of the American hot breaks

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Christmas song.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Down my Christmas tree, don't remember anything.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The waiting for my phone to ring.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Wake up that I'm freezing.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Drinking doesn't kill my thing.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Children spinning at night windows must be Christmas time again.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No stars in my bed.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No one shines for me.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I live as Christmas never came.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Every year the same goes night.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself with my.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself with my.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm gonna be by myself with my.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm gonna be by my life again.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It breaks the night, yeah.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You can be a odor better or a night we dead by Christmas.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Anyway the world's Christmas party.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're the only other way.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And we show it never before.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The only Christmas day.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's gonna be the night.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No stars in my bed.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No rush out to me

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I wish there was never a game

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Every else I say

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
For the same thing

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm gonna be

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm gonna be by my side

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But get through

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm gonna be

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm gonna be by my side

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm gonna be by my side

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But get through

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm gonna be

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm gonna be by my side

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But get through

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm gonna be

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm gonna be

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm gonna be

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm gonna be

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm gonna be

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm gonna be

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
airesÂ´mas day

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,680
oh

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,040
tech

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We Christmas time is getting

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
See you at the Christmas party with you

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's all of the year

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I wish I was never born

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
See another Christmas year

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There's no tomorrow

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And no one shines for me

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I wish Christmas never came

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Every year's same looks like

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Christmas

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Christmas gift

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Christmas

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be alone

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And no one shines for me

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be alone

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No one shines for me

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be alone

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No one shines for me

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No one shines for me

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No one shines for me

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No one shines for me

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's American hard break on the source code

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's gonna be so lonely for them

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This Christmas

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
American hard break of course

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Michael Butler's band

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The Rock and Roll Geek

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Rockrogeek.com

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Woo

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
For those of you who grew up in Europe

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And probably grew up on mud

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's gonna be lonely, this Christmas

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That wasn't another one

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There's been a couple of, well, a couple of really

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Rock and Christmas songs

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is outro place at least one of them

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
For sure

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Really, really dig it

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I logged onto the pot

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So music now work this morning

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And look at the top, the top pod

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The place of the day

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Which I don't think is, is released yet

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, we're getting all that, you know, the story

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We're getting all that ramp top

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In fact, we're gonna talk about

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Resources for the pod

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Same music now work in a job cast

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Number three today

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Michael Butler roaming around

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
To the pod show offices

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And, and talking once again to

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Actually, they go to the new offices

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Which we were not in yet

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And they also talked to

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He talks to Brian Longest about

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Positions that we're looking to fill

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Which include those for the pod

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's Wednesday, mighty

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm feeling a bit better

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Had a massive bouts of coughing last night

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Which kept Patricia up

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Of course

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But otherwise, we're all really pretty happy today

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Things are going well

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The mist is not cleared up

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not gonna go away

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Here in just south of London town

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And we had a good fun last night

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Patricia and I had a play date together

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No, yeah

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Get your mind out of the gutter

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The play date we had

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Was to work on the Christmas song

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The pod safe music

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Artists extravaganza

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We need to come up with a name for that

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Actually, this is the thing that

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I made a shout out for

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And people jumped on and

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Slaw, of course, it's his song

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So he's coordinating this

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And producing it

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
CC Chapman on board

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wrangling people around

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm not quite sure

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I thought that there was something

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But the pod said music network

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where you could click the link

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And find out how you could contribute

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I may be wrong about that

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Some people sent me email

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That they couldn't find it

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So I'm not quite sure

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But I really want to try

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Trying to stay as hands-off as possible

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
From the entire project

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
From a management standpoint

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But we did want to contribute

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And Slaw asked if Patricia would contribute

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
A couple of vocal tracks

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So now the podcast complex

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Is set up entirely for podcast

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Not for multi-track recording

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Certainly not

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
For multi-track recording

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
With proper monitoring

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because when you're singing

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You need to be able to create a separate mix

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
For the singer

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Then what you're hearing in the

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Quote control room

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Which of course is well

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Separated by two feet of carpet

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Because basically Patricia was standing there

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
With a mic next to me

173
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Also we discovered that

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The Hile, it's a Hile, isn't it?

175
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, I heard someone say a heal

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But it's not, it's Hile

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hile

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
See, Kyle doesn't like her

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Fun

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The PR40

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Which I love for the podcast

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Not good for Patricia

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The minute she starts to whale

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The whole mic just closed down

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Almost

186
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I had to break out the AKG for

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now what I did is

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I ran into all the problems

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I've heard Ron talking about

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Conflicts, the external devices

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not working

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And then deck just decided to crash

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Continuously that was fun

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So that didn't work either

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Obviously

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And then I resorted to

197
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Of all things

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The garage band or garage band

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
As we say here in the UK

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And actually

201
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When using it for

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Specifically for

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm opening up garage band here

204
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
When using it for

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
For multi track recording

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It actually, it kind of worked

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I was quite proud of myself

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
To be able to create these separate mixes

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And stuff, so let me just

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So this is

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is the guide track

212
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This is the slow central

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Long

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let me see if you

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Right, so that's

216
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's the chorus

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now this

218
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The song

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't know anything about this

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've never done any multi track

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Engineering

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I think like that

223
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But apparently

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's not in Patricia's key

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Which means that she had to go

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So low that she really

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Just couldn't really do much

228
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And so she decided to do a multi part

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Harmony for the chorus and then some wailing at the end

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And actually let me

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So we have three

232
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Three parts of the chorus that she did

233
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She touched me and told me a lot here

234
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Listen to this

235
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So that's three voices

236
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's two of Patricia's voices

237
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Now take one out

238
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There's the second one

239
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Now listen to the third

240
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The third one for the harmony is pretty interesting

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How to sound

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And it's really interesting doing that

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because if you listen to just that one

244
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That one harmony

245
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
By itself

246
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It sounds like ass

247
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think the official musician's term is

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let me just move forward

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes

250
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We make all our dreams come true

251
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And with the other way

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We're every day

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I thought that was pretty cool

254
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then she did something at the end

255
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I definitely want you to hear that

256
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll just play this bit with the

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll mix it back and forth

258
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
She did two tracks

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So I'll kind of mix back and forth

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Give the illusion that I'm here

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Helping the production of the song

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll check it out

263
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
All right, cool

264
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So I sent those off to SLOW

265
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Of course I neglected to remove the reverb

266
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
From the track so I had to do it again

267
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But okay, so hopefully that'll be a contribution

268
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That can make it into the final product

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm really excited about this

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is so cool

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The possibilities are really limitless

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you can start putting together

273
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You know bands

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And by the way Patricia's looking for a nice combo

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If someone out there wants to cut some standards

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She's ready for you

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
She's ready for you

She's ready for you

Whether it's politics, religion, business, family, sex

306
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Or encounters without of control celebrities

307
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I've screwed it all up

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So don't do as I do

309
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do as I say

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000

We find it a whole series of slides

We find it a whole series of slides

1018
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
We're definitely looking

1019
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We have been for quite a while

1020
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We've interviewed quite a few people

1021
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And we're looking for some more

1022
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I mentioned Ajax's

1023
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Ajax's really

1024
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And I should call it an

1025
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Interactive web application development environment

1026
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So it's

1027
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, those sort of things

1028
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And how they interact

1029
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So anyone who lately has had a lot of experience

1030
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
With Ajax would help quite a bit

1031
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Of course, always communications

1032
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
In terms of RSS indication and XMLRPC

1033
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And the lastly, I should say two other things

1034
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Manipulating file formats

1035
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
MP3, audio files, WMVAAC

1036
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That would help quite a bit

1037
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Someone who has had a lot of experience doing that

1038
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Sounds like a lot of great things are in the work

1039
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm still like a office company man here

1040
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But it really does sound like you guys have a lot of things

1041
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah, I should mention one more

1042
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Web application APIs

1043
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So anyone out there who's actually helped

1044
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
In terms of opening up a connection with

1045
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Their current companies infrastructure

1046
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Someone who's created APIs

1047
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Created a developer environment

1048
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So we can actually go out to those and say

1049
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Here's how you can hook in

1050
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Here's the APIs, here's the function calls

1051
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And support that

1052
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm sure there's people out there that have created these environments

1053
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
They're extremely interesting

1054
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And it's a great interaction between

1055
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Programmers and other companies in our own

1056
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So that's something we're looking to build as well

1057
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I should say actually so would we cover

1058
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Some filled positions recently and now we're looking for

1059
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
A number of individuals with any of the above experience

1060
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay, I didn't catch what most of those technicality terms are

1061
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Because I'm not well versinepa

1062
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
If you go to where what's the website again to find out

1063
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
If you're just going to podshow.com

1064
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And currently under the about us page

1065
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You'll find it in the upper right hand corner in the Nav bar

1066
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And if you look at those you can actually click

1067
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
To respond to a particular job description

1068
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Which is nice because it puts the job description in the subject line

1069
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Or they can just send directly to jobs at podshow.com

1070
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And any of the experience that I listed or skill sets

1071
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
If they could put that in the subject line

1072
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Or in the body of the email

1073
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That would help tremendously

1074
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Are you looking to hire maybe before Christmas or

1075
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, we're looking at resumes right now

1076
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I mean with this is coming out right before Thanksgiving

1077
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So if people could obviously start sending them in

1078
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Because over the holiday will be feeding our faces with turkey

1079
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But we're always working

1080
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Alright well there you go job cash number three

1081
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And if you're out there looking for a job

1082
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Good luck to you

1083
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Thank you very much

1084
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I should also mention these are in San Francisco positions

1085
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Right

1086
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
We're always looking for people that send from out of state

1087
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's perfectly fine

1088
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We look at them we take a look

1089
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Some people want to relocate

1090
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But these are corporate positions here at the offices

1091
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Some San Francisco

1092
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Now if it's the right person

1093
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You might help out with relocating costs

1094
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah, we'll always look into that

1095
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Absolutely

1096
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Alright, well this concludes job cash number three

1097
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
This is Michael Butler with Brian Wong

1098
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Thank you Michael Michael

1099
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Right on

1100
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I really like listening to those because

1101
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's kind of a sound seeing tour effect

1102
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You know you're really there

1103
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Although I think they could have done a lot of the talking

1104
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
About the positions available on the walk from

1105
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The temporary office to the new office

1106
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But that's just me you know if I'd been producing it

1107
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But I wasn't asked

1108
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay feedback on lots of things that

1109
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Talks about yesterday

1110
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I made a big boo boo yesterday

1111
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Who will ma'am

1112
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And did I hear about it

1113
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Dash in a space

1114
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Come on Adam

1115
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
God damn it

1116
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Don't even let people think they're doing that's okay

1117
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Unless it's a

1118
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Unless it's part of their name like

1119
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Don't net rocks or five questions

1120
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That's a stupid

1121
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah, it gets you to the top

1122
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But it's a it's a crappy cheating idea

1123
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If that's indicative of the kind of crap

1124
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We're trying to get away from

1125
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So maybe if people would put as much thought

1126
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Into their content as they do into these stupid little tricks

1127
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Then they would get the listeners that they deserve

1128
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I love you, ma'am

1129
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But come on be responsible

1130
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Go puff on a fatty and think about it for a moment

1131
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And then keep on doing the nice work that you're doing

1132
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
At least the rest of it's nice I think so

1133
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm Michael Karina from the digital media cast

1134
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Experiment and carry on

1135
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But just don't tell them that crap anymore

1136
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm sorry

1137
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm not even going to tell you what that was about you left to go listen for yourself

1138
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I caught myself when I was saying it

1139
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You know I did I'm sorry about that

1140
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah

1141
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You don't a big fan of lost the lost

1142
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Television series and I get them through iTunes on my iPod

1143
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh, I guess I can get it to

1144
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Maybe I can get it today, right?

1145
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It doesn't air Tuesday night, which means it's available Wednesday

1146
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It doesn't. It's gorgeous

1147
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And I really sit down on my coffee and my split and get ready to watch it

1148
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I usually watch it on my power book full screens

1149
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just fantastic

1150
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I discovered a lost podcast

1151
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Which is actually produced by ABC

1152
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This thing's really good

1153
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And the host interviews people, the producers of the show

1154
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That was a pretty interesting episode actually

1155
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And actors on the show

1156
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And of course because it's done by ABC

1157
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It really all kind of

1158
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Connects you know so they have the access to everybody

1159
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And I'm just sitting here going like

1160
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Dude I'm totally totally enjoying this

1161
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You've got to be sucked in

1162
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm loving that podcast

1163
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm loving the show

1164
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm paying a buck 99 per episode

1165
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What are you doing with all those stink and transmitters

1166
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You guys don't need that

1167
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You know you could scale down a lot

1168
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You know you don't have to feel the air

1169
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
With all that crap just give me this kind of stuff

1170
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Give me this

1171
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'll be very happy

1172
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Dennis Petiz

1173
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This Thursday thanks getting the lost producers

1174
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Are doing a special 48 minute podcast

1175
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
With commentary on the collision episode

1176
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh that's shown today

1177
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Tonight is the collision episode

1178
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And then I guess tomorrow

1179
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The show will be available

1180
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So if you get the episode

1181
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Sink it with the podcast

1182
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It should sound just like a DVD with commentary

1183
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh man, cool is this

1184
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So if I'm able to start both at the same time

1185
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Then I can get kind of like the directors cut

1186
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Of course all we need is for someone to really sink it up professionally

1187
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But then

1188
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Dearer and we'll get in the way and you can't distribute that

1189
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And bloody bloody bloody bloody well

1190
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That crap anyway

1191
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I think it's very cool

1192
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It works

1193
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The podcast it's great

1194
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Lost good show

1195
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Hey Adam, it's Liam

1196
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh, hey Liam

1197
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Hey baby

1198
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Hi I was listening to you talking about feeds

1199
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And sometimes if one goes down

1200
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
They're gonna lose all these listeners

1201
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And I wanted to ask you a favor

1202
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
If you play my comment to let everybody know that

1203
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Currently one of our

1204
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Our feeds on iTunes

1205
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Isn't functioning correctly

1206
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And it only has like 31 episodes on it

1207
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Where is the videos of publish something like 36

1208
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So there are people out there who think that

1209
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
We haven't put anything out in weeks and weeks

1210
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And it's making me really sad

1211
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Chris McIntyre over at Pod Show

1212
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's already working on it

1213
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He's totally awesome

1214
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Doing his best to help out

1215
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But until it gets fixed

1216
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It'd be great if people could just go to

1217
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
BittyBlog.com

1218
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
B-I-D-D-Y-B-L-O-G

1219
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And sign up with the feed that currently functions

1220
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm especially sad because if they're the current thread that we're on

1221
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It treats the vehicle that we rented most recently

1222
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Which we lovingly dubbed

1223
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The excuse my French

1224
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Cock-On Wheels

1225
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So Adam

1226
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Thanks again in advance

1227
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And podcast listeners

1228
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Once again, it's still the serious BittyBlog

1229
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
B-I-D-Y-B-L-O-G.com

1230
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Thank you, Liam

1231
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Doesn't she sound like an angel?

1232
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I love the Bitties

1233
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Tomorrow we're picking up our cock on wheels

1234
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
He, he, taxi-Erika's coming over

1235
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
He's in fact he probably just landed on EasyJet 51-40

1236
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Whatever it is

1237
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And he'll cab it over here

1238
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
He's staying overnight with us

1239
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And he's going to drive the Audi A8 back to

1240
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The Netherlands where it has to be delivered

1241
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Because I had that release company lease

1242
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And then tomorrow hopefully if all goes according to plan

1243
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
We pick up the new curry cruiser

1244
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah, email from Brad

1245
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This isn't email he actually sent to

1246
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I said he had been having trouble downloading album of the year

1247
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
By Brother Love on iTunes for days

1248
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
He's more iTunes problems

1249
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh man

1250
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So he sent off whatever problem he had

1251
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh that's right

1252
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You got like iTunes would say

1253
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That song or that album is being modified and cannot be downloaded

1254
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So we sent off a comment

1255
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Apple and got a reply

1256
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Dear Brad, thank you for contacting iTunes

1257
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Music store

1258
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
We take the quality of our products very seriously

1259
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Please do not attempt to download this title again

1260
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Within the next two weeks

1261
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
This will give us time to resolve the issue with the title

1262
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Or remove it if we need to

1263
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We hope that you continue to enjoy purchasing

1264
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Music from the iTunes Music store

1265
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That's really weird

1266
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Two weeks

1267
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It just dries up

1268
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I mean what I'll do to sales

1269
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Now I'm glad that Brother Love is not in the middle of an advertising blitz

1270
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Or anything like that

1271
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I mean that's totally fucking sucks

1272
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But it's a big infrastructure

1273
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I think they might have met enough a little more than they can chew

1274
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
By adding the podcast to the iTunes Music store mix

1275
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't know

1276
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I think that now all the little

1277
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The interface is great

1278
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And it looks beautiful

1279
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But now I think people are starting to catch on to all the little buggies

1280
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And the stuff that we could do so well

1281
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
In kind of in the open community you speed back

1282
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And you have a place to go and talk to them

1283
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But that's as we discussed

1284
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That's not really within Apple's DNA to do that kind of stuff

1285
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But I am seeing more and more of those problems crop up

1286
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You know that does leave the door wide open for competition now

1287
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It doesn't

1288
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh shit

1289
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
How soft is this

1290
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And you had an audio comment from Melinda

1291
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Regarding the iPod

1292
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The MM50 and Scratchers

1293
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And I just thought I'd drop you an audio comment regarding the products I bought

1294
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Quite recently

1295
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And just you know I really need to paint this product

1296
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Because it's really a very good

1297
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Very good creation

1298
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Basically

1299
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah there's a company called Invisible Shield

1300
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Their website is www.theinvisibleshield.com

1301
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And they sell a whole plethora of different covers for different things

1302
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Including iPods

1303
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And other MP3 players

1304
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Things like the PSP

1305
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Mobile phones

1306
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Digital cameras, screens

1307
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And also some other portable devices

1308
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And they are really really good quality

1309
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And a very very good investment

1310
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
To protect your iPod from Scratchers

1311
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I bought an iPod Nano

1312
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Shortly after they came out

1313
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Primarily to listen to podcasts on

1314
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And the

1315
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They sell a full body protector

1316
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And a body protector with the wheel cut out

1317
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And what they are is thick

1318
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Sticky back plastic

1319
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Not the stuff they use on blue Peter

1320
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
For any of your British listeners

1321
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But really strong stuff

1322
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That can't get scratched

1323
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And once you've applied it it stays there

1324
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And you can quite easily operate the click wheel

1325
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Through the plastic

1326
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And it's really good

1327
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Because it means you don't actually have to have another case

1328
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
All your accessories work reasonably well

1329
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
For people who have FM transmitters

1330
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Or the Lanyard headphones for the Nano

1331
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And they are relatively cheap

1332
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Compared to the protection you get

1333
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
For me, anyway, they cost

1334
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Do this

1335
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Your audio just

1336
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Less to get

1337
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Bites so incredibly much

1338
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I tried to pump it up

1339
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay, so that's

1340
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I think the bottom line here is that

1341
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
These things just scratch

1342
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I think there was even another audio comment about this

1343
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I am listening to the DSC 284 right now

1344
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And one of your listeners had just asked you a question

1345
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
About the iPod screen scratching

1346
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
In the MM50 speaker system

1347
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Dude

1348
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
More cowbell

1349
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
To which you had the following reply

1350
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You know, first of all your iPods going to get scratched

1351
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
This crap

1352
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I have the black

1353
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
A video iPod

1354
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah, I used it three times

1355
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Maybe and it was scratched all over the face

1356
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So just get over it

1357
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's going to get scratched

1358
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm not going to get over it

1359
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And I don't think you should either add them

1360
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Because there's a simple solution

1361
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And with that I don't mean putting a protective case over

1362
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Because I find that the protective case

1363
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Is that you can buy

1364
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Very frequently

1365
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Cause

1366
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Just as many scratches

1367
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
As if you didn't have the case on

1368
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So my solution comes from the PDA world

1369
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And they are the PDA screen overlays

1370
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Now they're pretty basic

1371
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
They're just matte tack

1372
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Thin film

1373
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
With an adhesive side to it

1374
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And you just trim them down to the sides

1375
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You need them

1376
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Put holes in them with a pair of scissors

1377
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Or however

1378
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
For the controls on your MP3 player

1379
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And then you carefully stick them onto the screen

1380
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Your MP3 player

1381
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Now you want to make sure you don't get any bubbles under there

1382
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So

1383
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Doesn't this dude sound a lot like

1384
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Toby Radloft, the original nerd

1385
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Doesn't sound just like him listen to it

1386
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So dude slowly and carefully

1387
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And now your device is protected

1388
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
These screen overlays

1389
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
We'll now take the impact

1390
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Of keys or change or whatever

1391
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Would normally scratch your iPod

1392
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Or whatever device you choose

1393
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And when they get scratched up

1394
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You peel them off turf and put a new one on

1395
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Very simple

1396
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Very cheap

1397
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Very effective

1398
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So

1399
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Don't get over it

1400
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Get a screen overlay

1401
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Available at pretty much any office

1402
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Supply store

1403
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Now if I may

1404
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Short plug for my show

1405
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The Uberad G pod

1406
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Which is a podcast

1407
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Where I talk about

1408
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Scenarios and solutions

1409
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Such as this as well as other stuff

1410
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It is

1411
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The tagline is 80% tech

1412
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
20% everything else

1413
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm now also including

1414
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Shotsafe Music

1415
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And the website is

1416
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
UberadGeekpod

1417
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
DotBlogSpot.com

1418
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Anyway, thanks a lot

1419
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'll talk to you later

1420
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And

1421
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah, oops

1422
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Sorry

1423
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Dude, I wonder if his whole podcast

1424
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Is with that echo

1425
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I think that would

1426
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Trip me out

1427
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Can you imagine just listening to that for half an hour

1428
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think you might get hypnotized by it

1429
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The MM50 name

1430
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
That product contest continues

1431
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Lots of submissions

1432
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Austin Chen

1433
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Says

1434
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Those MM50s looks sweet

1435
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
How about these names

1436
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Sound Cyclone

1437
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Pod Blaster

1438
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Concert Hall

1439
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
In a box

1440
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Sound tsunami

1441
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I like that one

1442
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Sound tsunami

1443
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
That's cool

1444
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Wave sound

1445
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Wave Blaster

1446
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Logic Blast

1447
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Audio Max

1448
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Audio explosion

1449
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Audio pump

1450
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Sound pump

1451
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Audio pounder

1452
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Audio pounder

1453
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Audio pounder

1454
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That works for me too

1455
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Very cool

1456
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay

1457
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Let's see

1458
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Oops

1459
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
We have my kind of submission here

1460
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
What do you say?

1461
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I coostick

1462
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Hmm

1463
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay

1464
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I still like porta potty

1465
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That's still the best

1466
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Port high potty

1467
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Or the boom dock

1468
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Okay

1469
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
That's pretty good too

1470
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
That's from Scott Ruben

1471
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Um

1472
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
What I like most of course is audio feedback on the topic

1473
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Hey Adam

1474
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
My name is Brian

1475
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm coming to you from Central Pennsylvania here in the States

1476
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Just thinking about the MM50

1477
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Speaker nicknamed contest

1478
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And I figured I would send you a couple entries

1479
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I guess I'll just go down the list of what I have

1480
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I mean one of my friends had set around

1481
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And these were the best ones we came up with

1482
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
First one would be the eye castle

1483
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I think when the eye pot is in there

1484
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Kind of looks a little bit like a castle wall

1485
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
The second one is eye wave

1486
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Third one is eye sound wall

1487
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And the fourth one is eye speaker ethic

1488
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Hope you're doing well

1489
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Keep the daily source code coming

1490
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I love this podcast

1491
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Popty later

1492
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Bye bye

1493
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I do thank you very much

1494
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Now I still think porta potty is doing the best for me

1495
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Remember you got to think about the movie

1496
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What's in there?

1497
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
What's in there?

1498
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
What's in there?

1499
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
What's in there?

1500
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
What's in there?

1501
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What's in there?

1502
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
What's in there?

1503
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What's in there?

1504
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Let me in your iPods and MP3 players

1505
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I just don't know where it is

1506
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Okay?

1507
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'll go look it up for you

1508
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Listen to some potsafe music from

1509
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Music.potshow.com

1510
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You want some jazzy shams

1511
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Baby, we've got it here for you

1512
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Robin Stein never should get by

1513
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I will give it to you

1514
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You give me a lick They stare

1515
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Twice they turn yourï¿½ï¿½er away

1516
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Should I go or show it as t

1517
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I didn't even know you're only me

1518
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Just a hug, just a kiss in a darkened away

1519
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I said, it's what made it better

1520
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Samarine play you

1521
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
You didn't even know me

1522
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
We were taking a chance

1523
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Well, this could touch my lips

1524
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I gave you a world your heart, I'm through

1525
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Right before my eyes

1526
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
We're new, we've never say goodbye

1527
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So I was told to take you home

1528
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Show you things you never know

1529
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Till my beating heart was still

1530
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I had my fill

1531
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And you never tasted wine so sweet

1532
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
When I let go, you're about to hold

1533
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Such a story, never told

1534
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
My son lives here the way

1535
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You can't believe the things I see

1536
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I can't believe the things we did

1537
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
My day and a chance

1538
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The romance can touch our lives

1539
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I gave you a world your heart, I'm through

1540
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Right before my eyes

1541
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
We're new, we've never say goodbye

1542
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Just a bit of twisted faith

1543
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Right back in the day

1544
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I wanted you up to

1545
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I began to breathe

1546
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
When you say

1547
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I've never loved the girls we

1548
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You are taking a chance

1549
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Well, this could touch our lives

1550
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I gave you a world your heart, I'm through

1551
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Right before my eyes

1552
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We're new, we've never say goodbye

1553
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
We're new, we've never say goodbye

1554
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
We've never say goodbye

1555
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
We've never said goodbye

1556
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Robin Stein from her

1557
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
CD Day Dream

1558
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Never say goodbye

1559
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Under Daily Source Code

1560
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That comes to you from the Podsame Music Network

1561
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
That's the place where podcasters

1562
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And independent artists come together

1563
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And exchange vows

1564
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So I will be diligently reporting that

1565
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Okay, I was thinking of Michael Keaton

1566
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That was dumb because it was of course

1567
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Dudley Moore, the movie was crazy people

1568
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Co-starring Darrell Hanna

1569
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And Paul Reisers in that as well

1570
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
If you've never seen the movie, please go and see it

1571
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Because that may be the advertising model for the future

1572
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh, what?

1573
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Honesty

1574
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
What a freaking concept

1575
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Hey Adam, just a quick note from my list of

1576
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Today's source codes in the Netherlands

1577
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I got the iPods video just a week ago

1578
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Two weeks ago, maybe

1579
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And I really loved the device

1580
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I worked right to work in the morning

1581
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And I were back in the afternoon

1582
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And I loved listening to podcasters in the car

1583
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And it's so cool to watch video in traffic jam

1584
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Don't really, I'm careful

1585
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
One downside though to the iTunes

1586
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I found scratches

1587
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Was that I wasn't able to install a UK version

1588
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I had to install a Dutch version of software

1589
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And I don't like Dutch software

1590
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It says CD, I'd wrap up instead of just eject

1591
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So I had to install the Dutch version

1592
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Because with the UK or US version

1593
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It wouldn't take my credit card in the iTunes store

1594
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Okay, I deinstalled my iTunes

1595
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I installed the freaking Dutch version

1596
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And then they would take my credit cards

1597
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I deinstalled the iTunes

1598
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I reinstalled the US UK version again

1599
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And it was working

1600
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But I still end up in the Dutch iTunes store

1601
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And there's no way I can find any episodes of last

1602
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Any episodes of desperate housewives

1603
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And a lot of other stuff

1604
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I just can't find it

1605
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Now maybe I do something wrong

1606
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But I think I just can't buy anything

1607
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
A US customer can buy on iTunes

1608
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So that's right

1609
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I have to be in my content

1610
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Let's go back to lime wire

1611
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And that kind of stuff

1612
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But I do want to pay for it

1613
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So maybe this is an announcement to Apple

1614
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Please make that possible

1615
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So I can just pay for my episodes of Lost of Desperate housewives

1616
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
By the way, great show that daily source codes

1617
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I enjoy it every day

1618
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
On my way to work

1619
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And back, keep up to good work

1620
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
All right, buddy, thank you very much

1621
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Well, what you're witnessing here is not Apple's fall

1622
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
This is the conundrum that is international rights

1623
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Because they make money off of these TV shows

1624
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Believe it or not

1625
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And they don't want to compete with the local markets

1626
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And have to get clear

1627
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And says it's the same thing with the regions on your

1628
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
On your DVD disk

1629
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
The only way to do it is to get a credit card

1630
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That has billing in the US

1631
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Which I now have, thank goodness, thanks to the company credit card

1632
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Who doodifully pays for my 1,99 episodes of Lost

1633
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
All right, everybody, I got to get out of here

1634
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
My buddy, taxi, Eric is coming tomorrow

1635
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We pick up the credit cards

1636
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh my god, trash is sticking in here

1637
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I wasn't quite ready for that

1638
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Tomorrow we pick up the credit cruiser

1639
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
We'll be talking, have a happy Thanksgiving, everybody

1640
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Interesting, they don't really celebrate it over here

1641
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I wonder why
