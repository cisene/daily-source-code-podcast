00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charley 2-6-2

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
On Show.com make no claims regarding the quality of its hot chillers or the sanity of its producers. Listen at your own risk.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There are no secrets.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Only information you don't get out of.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Adam Curry.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We don't need no sticky and greasy.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is Adam Curry.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's the 19th of October in the year of our Lord 2005 good morning.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First time in weeks I could say it ain't all that sunny.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Everybody how you doing.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right in early here, Northern California coming to you from the Curry condo.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It is the Daily Source code.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's a bit of the week. It's Wednesday.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Cloudy, rainy and the sun is just coming up over the horizon.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's a little bit before 8am.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Of course means that a lot of you.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A lot of people listen to the source code.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's enough for hours.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
These codes.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You pay.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Other parts of Europe.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh man.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sorry about yesterday.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Apologies.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There was just no way I was going to be able to make a show.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I spent a lot of time.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Was it Monday evening talking to Andrew Grumman?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Andrew was leading developers on iPod 11.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Just talking through life and stuff.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know when you get talking through life and stuff like that before you know it's 11 o'clock.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yesterday.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think I told you that we had to go.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ron and I were going up to Redmond to pay a visit to Microsoft.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And the flight left.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think the flight was like 7.15.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I was up at 4.30.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh man.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's just a way to early for me.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So of course I'll tell you a bit about our travels.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Beware.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Of course I'll have to shoot you after I tell you everything right.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So a show full of things to talk about.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Promos.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Plenty of European promos as well.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And of course pod save tunes and a mashup.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This one I've been kind of holding on to for a couple of days.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's titled Fat Boy Betty.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can't help it.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh yeah.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is a waking up.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nothing else.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's Fat Boy slim versus.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Be polycliffer.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
For mashup town.com.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

Yeah.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,500
Yeah.

96
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Yeah.

97
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Yeah.

98
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,000

Right.

103
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah.

104
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,400
And tell me where it's coming from, what you're making, everything's gonna have so much time to try to get it out

all ready, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you all have an awesome comic screen, our favorite leather advertisings's design, well, all right, we'll see you next time.

120
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,920
There you go. I apologize. I hadn't put up the the picture of the beautiful sunrise yesterday that came up over the MM50

121
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm a logitech speaker set. I just had no time. Yeah

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,840
Yeah, I have one of those

123
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,800
What's it one of those is it a Casio camera thing of a Casio camera doesn't it I wish it had blue tooth because

124
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,200
You know to hook up hook it up to the Mac and get it into iPhone

125
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,620
Oh, and then export it and do all that stuff is just too much. I got to set that up. Well

126
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,700
So here's the thinking I've been through this. I told you that I'm you know, just struggling along here with the power book

127
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,080
I think hopefully before the week and otherwise in the weekend. I'm gonna get TV's

128
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,180
I got to get an I Mac up here

129
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,540
Which you may actually turn out to be one of my TVs at this thing can maybe just get one of those adapters you can go from the cable box into the

130
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,260
Into the Mac so I'll might do that and

131
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,780
Somewhere between five minutes ago and

132
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,820
Four hours from now the cable guy's gonna come so I'm kind of well

133
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,660
I hope he shows or she shows up

134
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Before 1030 because I really have to go Ron and I I'm gonna go see

135
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:25,380
Ray Lane one of one of our investors. It's you know, we try to do that actually we try to do that almost every week. There's so much going on and

136
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,940
And it's kind of cool to go get advice on stuff

137
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:36,840
So yesterday we went up to Seattle. I have to say when Ron and I travel. It's actually it's actually quite nice because

138
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,500
Once wheels are actually once we're in the plane

139
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,700
There's no one that can interrupt us. You know, there's no phones. There's no one saying you kind of just ask you one question

140
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,040
And it's great and especially if flight like that which is under two hours, I guess it would like an hour and 20 minutes or something like that

141
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,360
Oh, man, do we get the jam? We're like we're like like we've been married for 15 years, which is almost truth

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,080
But oh, man, it's great. We bigger each other the whole way and now this won't work and how about this?

143
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,680
And I think it should be this and it's so it's very very it's early

144
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,080
But it's it's an extremely creative. So actually everything went pretty smoothly flight was good

145
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,360
got up to Redmond and of course the person we were seeing there the

146
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Was my buddy Eric Hirsch

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
he is

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,440
I don't even know his title actually, but he sits at the head of the table. So so I guess he's in charge of something and we got a demo

149
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,080
And we had a lot of conversations of course and met a couple other people who were part of the windows media team and got a

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,920
demo of the new windows media player and

151
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
I'll tell you

152
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,920
If I could tell you, I would but I'd have to have to shoot you later on

153
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,880
So that was without a doubt very interesting being up there. It's still it's just not for me. I'd kind of tell you

154
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Redmond is no

155
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,440
Now that of course is not too far from from Seattle and before we left we had a couple other

156
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,720
couple other people to see couple other Seattle company. So all in all it was a very

157
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,160
Very fruitful day and of course when we got back to the airport typical if you're flying out of sea

158
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,960
Tag, you know, I was like well, you know, the flights delayed for four hours

159
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,960
So

160
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:32,880
Switching around jumping from carrier to carrier and you're supposed to go in Alaska and airlines and and wound up going on United and it was really cool on the way home

161
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,640
And I actually saw I was looking out the window. I'm like man is

162
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,200
You know, above the clouds, of course, and it was a full moon which is absolutely beautiful

163
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,920
Just blanketing across you know, this beautiful glow of the moon across these clouds that we were flying above and underneath the moon

164
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
I thought at first it was

165
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
It was a star

166
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,400
But I could look at it. That doesn't make any sense and there were no other stars to be seen strangely enough

167
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,360
And sure enough the the captain came on the inner com and

168
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,400
Said, you know, if you look out the left-hand side of the aircraft you'll see you see the moon

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,440
Okay, duh saw that but underneath that it's a planet. He said that's planet Mars and apparently

170
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
This is the closest Mars

171
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,360
Got to or has been to the moon and I subsequently I guess the earth in 60 years

172
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
I I'm I really should

173
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm hand maybe this lack of astronomy podcast that's more info on that was you definitely find out because

174
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
There was some kind of

175
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,120
Astronomical phenomenon going on that's for sure, but it was really really really beautiful

176
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Let me see I wrote down

177
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
a whole bunch of things here in

178
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
In my blackberry to talk to you about

179
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
See we talked about

180
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, they're telling you that safe weight. Did I tell you that safe weight delivered?

181
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
They delivered all of my

182
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Actually that was that was Monday night so I haven't told you yet

183
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,640
They delivered my my groceries which I'd ordered from the UK which was kind of cool. You know, so I set up the delivery time

184
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,640
And

185
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,560
Once again everything went well, I think somewhere someone else has milk had burst open and and it leaked a little bit on my stuff

186
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,000
But that was okay nothing. I mean, you know a little bit of milk won't harm anybody

187
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,720
But what they do is if they don't have a particular item then they'll make a decision the decision is whether they'll

188
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,960
Replace it with a different similar item or if they'll just say hey, sorry

189
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
We didn't have this and we'll credit your account for that

190
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,680
So what I'd ordered was some lovely even nilla French vanilla roast coffee

191
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,240
Which was out of stock now here's what they did

192
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,160
instead of

193
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Giving me a different flavor or

194
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,760
Well, I guess that they could have said well, we don't have it and you know will hook you up next time instead they gave me

195
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,680
decaffinated French vanilla roast now

196
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,280
If you're not a coffee drinker, you know stop for two seconds before you do something like that

197
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,560
There's a big difference between the taste and what it actually the drug itself does for you, right?

198
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,040
Huh

199
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040

Hi Adam my name's Paul. Do you remember this daily source code for Tuesday April 26 2005

209
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,400
I sure do that was the first podcast I ever listened to I know you bought my

210
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:05,360
Many I bought about two days before and I wonder what all this podcasting was all about and that was the first one I listened to

211
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,160
I've listened to every single one and when you don't do one I feel like something's missing

212
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm walking to work in this like

213
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720

224
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,280
The number 12 is sitting there. They're so technically a net they haven't been able to program the VCR clock to say the right time

225
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,000
Now your keys were on the outside of the vehicle. Oh my god. Now those are kind of automatic blocks over

250
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
No, I wanted for my armpits

251
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
I

252
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,680
Was going to a pentacosal church at the time hold my hands up

253
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,840
Brandy I was ordained I had become an ordained minister. I'm pouring them down rumming coke

254
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:52,720
Marjorie in beer everything. I had no idea. I started working in Christian radio. I was preaching in assembly of God churches or as I like to

255
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,640
Preface them ass of God churches. I am flying high to room spinning. I'm still way loaded. I was hardcore about Jesus

256
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,440
But not in the way that you would think they start she grab as a plastic bag it starts throwing up in it

257
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,080
I got involved in board again Christianity because I desperately wanted to lick this girl

258
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,320
And I begin to laugh as hard as I've ever laughed before the blind leading the stupid

259
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm in shack off del

260
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:28,080
I'm Harry short-rear. What you come with a Michael Antony shut up Chris pool us that I cannot help myself and

261
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,280
I already have become an ordained minister

262
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,560
You guys are nuts, man. The stuff you're putting in these promos these days out of control

263
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,720
What is there a lot of UK promos that I got what happened what happened over there was there

264
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,960
something that that made that everyone go and make podcasts and make promos? It's just it's amazing

265
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
My Gmail box was full of them

266
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,800
Speaking of promos, this is one of the things that that Ron and I you know as one of the the duets of

267
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,080
Of arguing in the air. We know we are the Kenny Rogers and Dolly part of conversation

268
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:11,040
Is about the podcast Expo the portable media Expo and because we have a couple of damn announcements we want to make

269
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,400
And you know we've we've got some information and we're looking at this and

270
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
We just don't think it's the right venue

271
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
To do that so we're

272
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
Gonna think about how and when we're going to make some of these announcements

273
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,840
Which we're very exciting we got some some pretty awesome stuff and leading up to that though

274
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
I'll tell you now that

275
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,120
Within the next two weeks maybe three weeks

276
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,360
We'll be ask I'll be asking you actually

277
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,520
Podcasters out there for I'm gonna call it an audition

278
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
And what we need you to do if you're interested and of course

279
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,800
I'll tell you more about what that is in in the next couple weeks

280
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,080
Be kind of gear up for it is we're going to be asking for promos

281
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,160
Because we're going to be

282
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,440
Listening to just as many podcasts as we can for for this thing that we're going to be doing and

283
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,080
Obviously the best way to hear about a show is not to listen to an entire show and see if you like it

284
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,560
Or that is a great way of course

285
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,440
If someone recommends it to you, but perhaps it's a little easier if you make a promo what you just heard and and of course

286
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
That's that's an art by itself, you know, and

287
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,360
If you're not quite sure what to do you know you can just

288
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,720
Record a minute or two minutes

289
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,480
I don't really care how long it is as long as it's entertaining and and and talks about your show and explains what you're about and

290
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,040
And we'll give you a special email address to send that off to so if you're gonna if you're interested

291
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,160
Then oh here comes the sun do do do do do I'm not gonna take a picture because I just won't put it up on the show notes anyway

292
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,000
So you could start working on your promo so information on that forthcoming for sure

293
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
What else was I gonna say about that

294
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:02,000
Man, I am so fuzzy I really am oh I can't wait until I have my my connectivity up here

295
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,360
This is just killing me you know so last night when I came back I was you know

296
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,120
I have to put the power book on a on one section of the couch and kind of lie down and only then

297
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,560
Do I get the connectivity because all of my free networks have gone away?

298
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,600
So and I think I did mention that that the idea I had about

299
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
If you have a Wi-Fi

300
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,920
Access point and you want to leave it open and have people connect and you could put up a web page and put up some instructions and control who comes in and for how long and for what reason

301
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,080
That actually it exists it exists in the open source firmware of links is

302
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,640
So if if you're interested in in doing something with that

303
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,160
I'll make sure that there's a link on the show notes if you're new to the daily source code by the way the whole concept of show notes is that

304
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,080
When you hear something on the show whether it's about whether it's a promo or a mashup or a song or just something I was talking about

305
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
You can go to daily source code.com and you'll find a link there

306
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:06,480
Which will take you to the show notes and so you really have have to remember one URL one internet address and anything else that you were interested in will show up there

307
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,440
And the show notes of course are done in great detail by Michael and and anyone else

308
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,840
That's kind of the cool thing anyone else who wants to add any piece of information to the show notes

309
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
So they got in pretty detailed

310
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,360
Including time codes when when I start talking about something or when a particular segment played on the show and the ending time codes

311
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
It's gotten very very detailed

312
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,440
One thing we're not doing though is is giving away the answers to the backtracks podcast or the hit test

313
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,520
Because of course if you look at the show notes first and you kind of blow the surprise

314
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,640
I have hit test number 66 lined up and ready to go is from Jan Paul out of course in the Netherlands and

315
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,760
Obviously haven't listened to it yet. He said I can see that it's it's longer than usual

316
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,800
He actually sent in his email. He said Adam this one's a little bit longer than usual so

317
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,680
That either means Jan has got something to say or he's done something freaky again. Let's check it out

318
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,120
I suppose you think you know I do

319
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,160
Hey Adam this hit test number 66 and again it's a hit test in which the three songs have something in common

320
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,120
And so I hope you can figure it out because is number one

321
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,920
For my shirt right said Fred by the way I'm wearing my white beater today. So it goes along with the test and this is number two

322
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,040
Do you remember and Michael Jackson do you remember and the final one is number three

323
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,680
What are that? Well the three have to do with each other and time stops down did you figure it out?

324
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
These are the answers

325
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:14,240
Hello Adam. It's Dave Fox your old accessories are from the Adam Curry top 30 hit list

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Let me listen what he has to say

330

These three songs were number three two and one on the weekend of March 6

331
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:46,640
1992 oh my god you predicted that right said Fred would be heard from again as he had fallen from number one to number three on his countdown

332
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,400
Recounted the story of Michael Jackson offending certain countries in

333
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,440
Can you hear listen to his voice man? Dave has got some pipes on him. He's the guy that does

334
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,960
Podcasting it's wait a minute. Do I have that here hold on I think I have I think I have

335
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,840
Let me see if I can let you hear that for a second here we go

336
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,760
This is this is who Dave Fox is I think yeah. Oh, okay. That didn't work

337
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,240
Oh, no don't scan for missing files. Oh, man. Why am I doing this?

338
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,800
Oh, stop. No, no, no, no, no, skip all go away cancel cancel. Oh shoot

339
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,560
I'm sorry I never should have done this. Let's just continue with Dave if it'll work even

340
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:36,480
Africa by touching his nose and predicted big days for the group missed her big and they're so into be with me

341
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:45,600
It's getting the crunch time on his list. I'm Adam Curry and the closer we get to number one the

342
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,720
Tess you can tell my testicles had not dropped yet in 1902 tougher it gets last week's number one

343
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Smash drops down to number three this week falling out of the top spot. I'm 260 it's right said Fred

344
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,480
I am 264 my love 264 my love love's going to lead

345
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
264 my shirt

346
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,440
Laughing all the way to the bank right said Fred. I'm two sexy number one last week

347
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,080
Downs number three this week. I don't think we've heard the last of right said Fred

348
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,000
hanging in the Hitler's day to cue. This is Adam Curry looking for the new number one song of the week and playing another

349
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Smash that came very close

350
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,880
This is the latest from a superstar who cut his trip to Africa short because the people there thought he was

351
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,240
dissonant and Michael Jackson was visiting several places in Africa shooting a video and just passing out some of that

352
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,680
Jackson goodwill but it turns out the people thought he was thumbing his nose at them literally

353
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,960
You know it seems Michael has a habit of touching his nose. Just something does when he's a little nervous seems harmless enough right

354
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,680
Now to the people of Africa they thought it was holding his nose telling them that their country smell

355
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh, not so obviously says Michael's people Michael Jackson touches his nose and the people get upset

356
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,200
Imagine what they would have thought if he'd grab himself

357
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,600
Michael's up to where places this week to number two with remember the time

358
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Time

359
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:01,760
Looking for a second straight number one Michael Jackson and remember the time all the way up to number two on the top 30 hit list

360
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,280
And for the past three hours we've been counting down to the biggest hit in all of the free world and we have finally arrived

361
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,320
At this song in the first ever chart hit for a band that once tried to make a name for themselves by using a pretty strange gimmick

362
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,040
You see they actually tried playing the guitars on stage with electric drills

363
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,320
Then gluing picks to the drills and then cut loose on the fenders produce some wild sounds the trouble was

364
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,280
It produced some flying guitar picks and often got their hair tangled in the spinning drills

365
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,320
Being a hair person that gives me nightmares so the guys decided to concentrate on making music instead and it worked

366
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:44,640
Climbing two points from three to number one at the top of the hit list is Mr. Big to be with you

367
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,880
Just to be the next to be with you

368
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Yeah, I'm gonna get you for this man

369
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:23,040
What's your chop? They finally made it I knew they could do it to be with you for mr. Big the brand new number one

370
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:30,720
Smash in America on the top 30 hit list and can Mr. Big stay Mr. Big and hang on to the number one spot for a second straight week

371
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,320
There's only one way to find out, of course be right here next week same time same station

372
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
So how did you do really?

373
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,880
I have to say before I go that this was some of the most fun production I've ever been involved with and I want to thank you

374
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,240
For making it happen for me and to young for contacting me and making this happen on the hit test

375
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,200
Well, thank you Dave you made it happen for us today. Thank you for working with me on the hit test

376
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,640
Well, Adam I hope you enjoyed this one and oh yeah, I hope you had them all

You can find information about the hit test at yompolet.com j and b-o-l-e-t dot com

379
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,640
Well until the next one until then bye bye bye bye buddy

380
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,280
17 years ago it's unbelievable oh

381
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,920
My goodness that was a great show to do that was in 1992

382
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:37,920
FM radio was still blasted you know we had top 40 radio was just through all over the place and and here's how they're worked

383
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,360
I created a

384
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
syndicated program which means

385
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,480
Yeah, thousands of radio stations around the country when most of them were still independent or smaller entities

386
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,640
It owned a couple of stations because that was a law back then that's changed quite a bit hasn't it and

387
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
and

388
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,120
So the concept was and it worked very very well is and you deliver a show to all of these stations once a week a three-hour show

389
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
We were delivering on

390
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,040
CDs so every week we'd have you know thousands of CDs made up for all these stations a pack of three at a time

391
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,480
And then the stations can play it whenever they want for free and I didn't get paid and I didn't have to pay them these days by the way

392
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,480
I think for airtime like that for deals like this you have to pay the radio station. It's gotten so bad

393
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,880
And what they do is they could insert an X amount of minutes of local commercials in every single hour

394
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,880
And then I would go and sell national commercials to like Pepsi and Reebok and and companies like that because you know

395
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,680
It would be on on hundreds of different stations and so you'd have a fairly sizable audience all before the infrastructure in fact

396
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
We didn't have

397
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,680
Trying to think well of course we had the internet

398
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
But it was

399
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,160
Kind of like that was go for time, man. I was using go for and text and and die. I was at

400
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,880
You had to have a PPP or a slip connection. I remember those days and

401
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,320
So Dave was working at Z100 and he was the production director and he'd put together

402
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,080
Well he started putting the show together on tape. I mean, there was that was it it was

403
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
It was magnetic tape to track tape

404
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:13,920
Man, you can hear all the little bits and the things that you'd put in there. So he was splicing his ass off and it was just around that time that I had received

405
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,440
A I had a Mac to from from Apple

406
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,800
Excuse me Daniel Paul was the guy it was hand in those out Apple used to give machines away to people

407
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
I had a whole division which was

408
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,120
Which it's it's so intense was to give away machines to people in the media and there was this little company in

409
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,640
New Jersey

410
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
There was just starting up and

411
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,680
They had a product called pro tools and

412
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
And

413
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:46,720
Through I guess through what they'd seen me talk about stuff on MTV. They they found me and they said well, would you mind beta testing?

414
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
And that changed my life

415
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,200
You know overnight it changed Dave Fox's life overnight. I mean, he had never really even used a computer except for like a

416
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,560
DOS command line thing so we sat for hours and hours and optimizing you know

417
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,960
OS 8 to make sure that it wouldn't crash out on pro tools and

418
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,000
And then the way we would do it is I would tape all of my individual breaks

419
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
You know all the things I was going to say

420
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,160
Like Sunday night I think it was and then Dave who live not far from me in Jersey as well

421
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,600
He'd pick up the tape for my mailbox a dat tape remember those

422
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,840
He'd pick up the dat tape and he'd take it to the studio

423
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,080
He'd then you know have to spin that off in real time

424
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,600
onto onto his hard drive and then he'd start assembling the show

425
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Great to hear from you Dave. Of course

426
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,320
We've been working with him for the past months once again

427
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Because when we when we decided to put the pod finder together for iTunes

428
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,840
Yeah, the first guy that came to mind was Dave and you know Dave on the whole exactly what what to do and how we want to put it together

429
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,760
And so but we don't really talk all that much it's just like you know

430
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,720
We send stuff back and forth through email and FTP and it goes so incredibly fast these days and and Dave has become just a freaking wizard man on

431
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
I think he still uses pro tools which is

432
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:08,080
Obviously a great for the digital realm. So good to hear you man. Thank you very much. Y'all for embarrassing me. Love it

433
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,880
Hello Adam this is Mike Dell of the Benzoyed Report podcast

434
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,360
podcasting is made a really big impact on my life

435
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,040
It's pretty much got me away from listening to traditional radio sad light radio

436
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:29,200
I back sound that serious so I can't listen to podcasts and I'm sad light. No, that's not true

437
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,080
But the other thing that's made a really big difference in my life over the years is ham radio

438
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,240
And to that end my self and John Martin KF8KK are putting on a ham radio class

439
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960

440
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,160
Pied class if you will and that will teach you everything you need to know to get your technician class

441
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:58,240
ham radio license from the FCC and such your in California part of the time

442
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,080
You've got a California mailing address the FCC would be more than happy to give you a license

443
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,400
And then when you get to England get your license here you can apply for reciprocal operating privileges in England

444
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,640
The Netherlands and probably Europe wide I didn't really sure how that works

Is now we're Bjork is from Iceland cool got a concert going on there

472
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,840
I've I know couple pilots who've flown up to Island

473
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,280
Interesting very very interesting. I had no idea that there was a podcasting community in Island there you go damn

474
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,240
This thing is really global. Oh, there's something I want to ask if anyone's a doctor out there. Hold on a second. Let me just grab

475
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,000
I can't find it. Remember I had my insurance test

476
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,360
Well, I passed the test, but there was I got the results. It's actually is interesting

477
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,360
I first time I've actually received results back from from a medical now I'm looking for it

478
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,320
Ah, shoot don't tell me. I oh wait, it's here it is

479
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
I'd already show prep this um

480
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,200
So they gave me the results back and I had a question about it

481
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
So everything is normal normal normal normal normal normal then it comes to the cholesterol

482
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,760
I don't I just don't know anything about cholesterol so it says here so you can the the results can be low normal or elevated

483
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,920
So cholesterol 200 and three milligrams per dl whatever the dl is deciliter or something like that

484
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:56,000
I don't know so there I have an elevated level then you have your LDL cholesterol which has no result next to it

485
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,720
Then the HDL cholesterol is 34 mg's per dl and that is considered to be low

486
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,880
And then I have my cholesterol HDL cholesterol ratio 6.0

487
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
Okay, here's the

488
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,080
Okay, oh I got it here says the normal clinical range for cholesterol is 140 to 200. Oh, okay

489
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,960
So I have 203. Okay, so that's just a little bit elevated and then on the

490
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,960
HDL cholesterol normally it should be

491
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:45,760
Greater than 40 mg per dl and I had 34 so it's slight variations but it should I be concerned and is the HDL cholesterol the good cholesterol or the bad cholesterol

492
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,640
Doctors out there listening help please let me know if I'm gonna live

493
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,360
I want to try

494
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,120
Beyond play when you're asleep is my die

495
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,800
I need a little more tree

496
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,800
With your arms around me

497
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,960
And I feel better not your heart

498
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:31,200
If you get on my hip breathing a little too cold

499
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,840
But I'm all again thinking about you

500
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,200
I need a little more tree

501
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,360
With your arms around me

502
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,960
And I feel better not your heart

503
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,240
I feel better not your heart

504
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,840
I feel better not your heart

505
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,840
And I feel better not your heart

506
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,800
I need a little more tree

507
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,960
With your arms around me

508
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,960
And I feel better not your heart

509
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,560
And I feel better not your heart

510
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:54,320
And I feel better not your heart

511
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,480
The muffs

512
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,280
Little luxury

513
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,080
Potsafe on the daily source code again that mega segment I really got to work on that it's fading stuff out way too soon

514
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,320
That's from the potsafe music network music dot pod show dot com and

515
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:17,520
And I'm just looking in the in the blackberry here because if you're listening to us on a serious satellite radio

516
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Then there is

517
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,160
Shoot man maybe if I start to fire up the browser I'll be able to to let you listen in on this hold on a second

518
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,520
Shoot that's not gonna work anyway

00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,520
There, so that's all it's all podcast coming up in the next

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
New sponsor I'll talk about that in a second

Podcasting with the east side of Philadelphia. It's the groggy java show my name is Ken Irman and I am groggy java

528
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,880
Google yet, but you'll man your show's what got me so inspired to start making podcasts and mashups in the first place

529
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,560
And now you've let me know that I must be doing something right. Thank you listen

WWE WWW dot ruckyjava dot TV is the place if any of your listeners want to check in

531
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,440
The show was talked with pod safe music and as ostensibly about me being a work at home stay at home

532
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,680
Dad, but usually ends up being a sloppy mess of narcissistic drool doing a lot of yo

533
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,560
I'm making myself late for work to get this promo out the door so I got a jet but I'll be back in touch later

534
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,760
Thanks, dude. Escarggy java dot TV and tell you listeners. I said hey yo, thank you so much. I'm out

Hot show content that will make you squeeze the dog and burp your mother

537
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,400
Hi, this is fam from the Dutch band Dr. Flexito

538
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:18,960
We played a funk in our own language so we can say whatever we want without raising suspicion with our friends the Americans

539
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,640
With this promo we would like to share with you some of the beauty of our language

540
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,520
So if you want to feel all European and cool for a moment, I'll just teach you the number one pick-up line

541
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
Every tourist in Holland needs to know

542
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,520
So here we go repeat after me

543
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,720
The poscoose puts the poscoose met poscoose puts once again

544
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,720
The poscoose puts the poscoose met poscoose put

545
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,200
Well, that was it so hard was it now keep practicing that line and maybe if you did it right

546
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,480
We'll teach you how to order a beer on your next promo in the meantime visit

547
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,320
If you want to know more of the Dutch language or just listen to our great music see you and

548
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,480
Don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't

549
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,520
Don't know that's a great

550
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,880
So those guys signed up the pod save music now where you can grab their tunes

551
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,120
Offer there. I wanted to play you one of their songs because actually it's pretty very funky good stuff

552
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,560
But because of the connectivity I could actually get a song to download

553
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,880
They also put their promo up on the on the PMM music dot pod show dot com

554
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,240
Which is great because you get an instant feel with these guys are about so they have their own podcast

555
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,000
By the way

556
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,480
Suggestion I wouldn't use what they suggested as a pick-up line that might not get you very far

557
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,200
Happened to be able to understand Dutch it is now

558
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,600
Almost eight forty five still no word from the cable guy

559
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,600
So that's gonna be a pain in the ass for sure

560
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,120
But I can tell you that the weather is changed in in the past

561
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,320
Well during this show literally the sun is just you know is beating down from

562
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,600
This coming up in the in the east obviously and to the west it's still you can see over the mountains

563
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:16,080
It's it's foggy Jesus Christ. I need to do a video cast when I get the I probably here's what I promise while I'm here in San Francisco

564
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm gonna do one of these and record it all on video so you can see

565
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
While stuff is playing you can see what I'm doing

566
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,880
Which of course has nothing to do with you with the podcast? I'm doing all kinds of other stuff

567
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,080
So you'll be able to watch I guess and then we talk about stuff

568
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,080
I'll just swing the camera on you be able to see it

569
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:37,520
I I could do it with my eyesight and the power book when I'm afraid that there's just too much data going through to the fire wire drive

570
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,280
So

571
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,840
Certainly by Monday if not earlier depending on when I can get the get all the stuff together

572
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
So when we were in New York

573
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:53,840
And we were meeting with the sponsors and marketers and advertisers and companies who were interested in getting into podcasting we

574
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,160
We met with the company well actually one of the the sponsors has bro and

575
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,880
I'm talking a couple weeks back now and has bro has this new product called an eye dog

576
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
I don't know if you've heard of this or if you've seen it

577
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,680
Unfortunately we only have one at the office and Chris McIntyre the Prince of podcast

578
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,160
Immediately appropriated it has a very unhealthy relationship with this toy and it's not really a toy because what it is

579
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,120
You plug it into either your you can plug it into your computer

580
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,480
You can plug it into your iPod or you can just keep it on your desk. It has a built-in microphone and

581
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,560
Essentially what this thing and helps us speakers in it. So essentially what it does is it

582
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,360
It's it's on your desk and it's it's a kind of a cross between a neopet

583
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
a

584
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,320
One of those Sony eyeballs, you know the robot dogs and

585
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,120
And yeah and speakers and and it's it's really cute. I have to say and I remember going back home to

586
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,920
To Guilford to the cottage and telling Christina about this

587
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,160
No actually I didn't tell her about it. She said hey dad

588
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,800
You know it's really cool. I said what you said that I dog and when I first heard about it

589
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,240
I was like is that really is that cool? Is that gonna be an interesting thing

590
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,840
But she thought it was cool and she'd never seen it she'd only heard about it or seen the picture and when Christina said something's cool

591
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:14,080
I usually pay attention because I am certainly not the not the thermometer of coolness

592
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,080
And it's really really it's really entertaining

593
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,480
You can pet it on its head and it responds and if you don't say anything then it'll start to bark and when they

594
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,560
It moves around the music. It's got lights in its head. Do you want to know more about it? Check it out at
