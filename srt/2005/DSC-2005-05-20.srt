1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's your daily source code, show number 180, something remarkable is happening here.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,240
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,880
radio is invented.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,440
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,440
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,440
That's right, it's show number 180 and it's Friday everybody, thank God.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,440
I've actually had to restart the show three times. My Mac has been acting up like a mother fucker.

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,440
I don't know what's going on. I think it's something to do with the file system and

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,440
they can say trying to rescan stuff and God knows what's going on.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Basically, I've crippled everything, turned off file sharing, turned off the

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Incernet on the Mac and it's working so far.

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Knock on wood, will you please for me?

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,440
I don't want to start all over again.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,440
So the past couple days have been a dreary in the UK.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Of course, this show coming to you from Kroy Cottage in the effluent London

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,440
suburb of Guilford, actually more a city.

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,440
And today this guy's decided to open up, so it's raining and it's perfect for the weekend.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Although I am off to the sunny west coast once again, we're talking about that today.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Also, I'll talk a little bit about the pod show on series.

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,440
I've got some excellent pod safe music coming up.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Of course, some promos and awesome email.

23
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:46,440
I really have to talk about the Eurovision Song Contest, which happens tomorrow night

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,440
as the finals being held in Kiev this year.

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Last night, there was a semi-final for kind of all the loser countries that

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,440
were below the fold on last year's show.

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Also, in order to participate, they had, I think that they had to pay like 150,000 euros

28
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
just to participate.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
It's really fucked up.

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,440
I'll tell you all about this Eurovision Song Contest later on today.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Let's see.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
What else was it going to happen?

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
It's just all kind of stuff going on.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm a little bit tired.

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
It's been a long, long week.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Finalized the first week of the pod show on series.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,440
So now I'm ready to relax for a day before I get on a plane and listen to

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,440
8 million pod casts at 8 miles high.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Literally.

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
But first we got a mashup for you.

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,440
It's DJBC.

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
I'm fine.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,440
When another week makes, what's opera doc on the source code?

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, Wabbit 2, W

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm going to kill the rabbit, oh mighty, I thought the world will be quiet at least, how can you do it, my darling, why are you asking?

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:37,400
I will do it with my speel in magic helmet, your spear in magic helmet, magic helmet, magic helmet, magic helmet, magic helmet

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,400
magic helmet, magic helmet, magic helmet, magic helmet

50
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:16,980

51
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,700
Who are they'all are blameton?

52
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:34,020
I've killed the rabbit too little bunny, poor what a weirde

53
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:52,400
No, what did you expect in an opera, I had the ending?

54
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,200
Oh man, I love that.

55
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Fantastic.

56
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,320
I could tell you that DJBC, you know, I don't know what he's doing, if he's doing drugs,

57
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,160
he'd better share some of that because he's got some great stuff going on.

58
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,600
It's a daily source code on a Friday, show number 180 as calculated by the people who track

59
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
that kind of shit.

60
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,240
I have lost count so long ago, we're going to pick it up, this is officially show number 180.

61
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,560
Want your promo or your pod safe music featured?

62
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Well...

63
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,240
Godfather, forgive me for troubling you with such a trivial matter.

64
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,480
I have come here to pay you tribute, and to ask you for a small favor.

65
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,400
I have a pod cast that I believe most people would find enjoyable, but I'm having trouble

66
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
reaching these people.

67
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,240
Podfather, you are a man of great influence.

68
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,640
Please, Podfather.

69
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,440
If you can find it in your heart to help me promote my pod cast, please tell me what I must

70
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,520
do to gain this favor.

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,120
Well, my son, it's quite easy.

72
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,080
Really, just go over to iPodon.org submitted in a couple of categories that you think

73
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
would fit.

74
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,160
Podcastali.com, another great place to submit your pod cast, or if you want to play it

75
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,280
on the source code, or on the pod show on Syria satellite, send it to submit at podshow.com

76
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,040
if it's pod safe music, send it to podsafe at podshow.com, and if it's a mashup, like

77
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,680
DJBC's been doing, send it to mashup at podshow.com.

78
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
It's been great.

79
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,640
I've been exposed to so many new podcasts and promos with a serious show.

80
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,280
It's just been fantastic.

81
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,880
There's plenty of room in those four hours a day, so send in your stuff.

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,480
Hello, this is Franklin McMahon from Media Artist Secrets.

The show's main goal is to get you rolling, get you activated creatively, but where

92

your creative career is now, and getting it to where you want it to be.

93
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh, and it's fun.

94
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Did I mention that?

95
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Oh, yes.

96
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
It's fun.

97
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160

We can also check out our inspiring articles, the video tutorials, pictures, and much more.

101
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:24,160

Alrighty.

108
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,080
Um, a couple of guys I met at the LeCipiusBitty Show at Joe's Pub and New York are

109
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,760
going on the road and they're going to start podcasting it and I believe it kicks off

110
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
today.

111
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,520
May 16, 2005.

112
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,480
Welcome to the Dutch Hupto podcast.

113
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,840
This is a test podcast to see if the system is working correctly.

114
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,880
So Friday, May 20th, I'll start a daily podcast covering a two-week road trip across

115
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
the USA.

116
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
See you then.

117
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Alrighty.

118
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,960
For more info on that podcast, check out the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

119
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Radio sucks.

120
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Listen to pod pirates.

121
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
I had a, I'm Johnny Fickery.

122
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
How about playing this promo?

123
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
I want you to sign up.

124
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Whoa, sorry about that, Adam.

125
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Once in a while the pod pirates get a little, uh, out of control here and, uh, you know,

126
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
sign up and I can do about it.

127
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Anyway, as I was saying, my name is Johnny Velcro and I'm the host of pod pirates.

128
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,080
And twice a week, we try to bring you the best independent music.

129
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
And we try to add a little bit of humor.

130
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Some people call it humor.

131
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Some don't.

132
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Fuck them.

133
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Anyway, uh, you can reach us at jvilcro.blogspot.com or gestures tier.lips.com.

134
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Or you can go to podcast alley and, uh, look us up and we're there.

135
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
So, uh, give us a shot.

136
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Give us a listen.

137
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
You like what you hear?

138
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I promise.

139
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Yeah.

140
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Later.

141
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Okay.

142
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Promises promises.

143
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Alrighty.

144
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
That sounds cool with me.

145
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Uh, look at in the email.

146
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
I got some fantastic email yesterday.

147
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,080
When I was, uh, like 15 or 16 years old, and I was really into radio.

148
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,080
This is just after I had started at a pirate radio station in Amsterdam called decibel radio.

149
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,080
I was 16 years old, um, except I had an, and I was a totaled wee nerd, excuse me,

150
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,080
since I say, oh, my goodness.

151
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Um, not popular at school, but, uh, once people found out that I was actually John Holden,

152
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,080
that was my air name on the radio, I suddenly became very much involved.

153
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,080
And John Holden, of course, was a big black guy from the States who drove a hearty

154
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Davidson through the, uh, through the streets of Amsterdam.

155
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,080
When in reality, it was me, the gauky little teenager who wrote a moped.

156
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Um, but one of my heroes at the time was Scott Shannon.

157
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,080
He was, um, let's see at the time he was on Z100 in New York.

158
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,080
And he had really crafted the, the zoo format, which was very popular in the 80s,

159
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,080
which, of course, is, you know, um, there's so many different rip-offs of it.

160
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,080
But it wasn't so much the form, oh, yeah, no, I have to say, was the format of the show,

161
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,080
you know, and they had, you know, the Claire, the news guy and news guy.

162
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,080
The news guy, uh, Jonathan B. Bell, who was community services director,

163
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,080
and then they had coach Mike for sports, and then there was Ross Britten, who was the sidekick.

164
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,080
But Scott Shannon really had an uncanny sense of timing.

165
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,080
And, uh, but he also knew how to really break it down and, uh,

166
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,080
and use music to really portray a sensitive point.

167
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,080
And one thing, because I, um, well, get to that in a second.

168
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,080
One thing that I learned from him was, you know, you should let the room breathe once in a while.

169
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,080
You know, silence can be beautiful too on the radio, and he was really good at that.

170
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,080
And not a lot of people have, you know, who have recreated the zoo format

171
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,080
have really glomed on to that, and it doesn't all have to be, uh, a rim shot.

172
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Um, so after Z100, he went to, well, first of all, when I started MTV in the States,

173
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,080
um, I did a personal appearance at some mall somewhere in Jersey.

174
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
And, uh, a part of that appearance was also Scott Shannon.

175
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,080
So I was like, oh, man, big fan of yours and have been, you know,

176
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,080
ripping your shit off and translating it to Dutch for years.

177
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,080
And, uh, we exchanged the phone numbers and turns out that we actually lived, like,

178
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,080
one street away from each other in Montclair, New Jersey.

179
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Um, then he got me basically started on the radio in the States,

180
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
and helped me up with the right people.

181
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
And this was just about the time he was leaving to start something called

182
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Pirate Radio in Los Angeles, uh, which didn't work out.

183
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Uh, just, uh, for a number of reasons, I thought the idea was pretty good,

184
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,080
but it just didn't quite work out the way he wanted.

185
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,080
So Scott moved back later, um, and has been on WPLJ, 955 in New York for the past 14 years.

186
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,080
And all of a sudden out of the blue yesterday, I get an email, which is an all upper case,

187
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,080
all caps, which is very typical for, uh, old school radio guys,

188
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,080
because that's how they type all the liner notes and all the, you know,

189
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,080
basically whatever is typed by, you know, someone like Scott Shannon,

190
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
it's going to be right on the air.

191
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,080
So it does sometimes, uh, help to do it all in upper case,

192
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
just because it's easier to read.

193
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Uh, so I just want to share this with you because I'm so, I'm so happy,

194
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
and so proud, really, to have received the team and I say,

195
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,080
my god, man, I should do the Scott Shannon voice.

196
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
My god, man, you're seem to find a way to make something happen.

197
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
I love what you're doing.

198
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,080
I'm still put putting along in New York doing the morning show on PLJ 14 years.

199
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Now my daughter's going to be a sophomore at the University of Virginia,

200
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
and we live in Purchase, New York.

201
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
I read that you have managed to hold your family together all as well.

202
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Send me your phone number.

203
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Let's talk Scott Shannon DJ USA and your former neighbor.

204
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I love it.

205
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,080
That, that really, that made my day.

206
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
That is just, is cool.

207
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,080
So, um, hopefully, um, next time in New York,

208
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
it won't be this trip, uh, it's either tomorrow,

209
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,080
which will be Saturday, maybe Sunday, uh, someone else has invited me

210
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,080
to stop by the house over the weekend, um, up in like San Diego, I think.

211
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Uh, so I may go earlier, but I won't be back until probably Thursday or Friday,

212
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,080
and I don't think I'm going to have a chance to stop by New York.

213
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
At these days, it's pretty wack.

214
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
You know, I'm, I'm booking tickets all one way,

215
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
because you just never know what's going to happen.

216
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,080
And of course, you know what happens when you get, when you book a one way ticket, right?

217
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Uh-huh.

218
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,080
You get that big quadruple F stamped on your ass,

219
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
and you get searched and searched and researched,

220
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
and supplementary search.

221
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Man, it's just ugly.

222
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
Hey.

223
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Hey, Tom.

224
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Hey, buddy.

225
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Okay.

226
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Yeah.

227
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Right on.

228
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Okay.

229
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Yeah.

230
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
Oh, okay.

231
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,080
That's a very good question.

232
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Actually, um, we're still contemplating how to do this.

233
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Um, we think that's going to be a couple of different versions.

234
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Um, currently cast blaster, which only works on Windows, by the way.

235
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Um, saves your podcast locally to your hard drive.

236
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,080
The next obvious step is what we're creating now is so that we have an API,

237
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,080
which is, um, it stands for application programming interface.

238
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Oh, God, this insane was hitting me today, folks.

239
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Um, and which, of course, will open up to other developers of podcast recording software.

240
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Or if, you know, they have recording software already, it would just be a,

241
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,080
a reasonably small addition to add that in to be able to get whatever you've recorded right up on,

242
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,080
on, um, on podcast or come, uh, you know, as your own podcast with your own podcast feed,

243
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
and you don't show notes, et cetera.

244
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,080
But we are also contemplating a release that will enable you to, uh, basically use the software

245
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,080
with any hosting service that you prefer.

246
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,080
So, uh, don't have an answer yet, but we'll very soon as we're about to, I say,

247
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
what does it like two more weeks, maybe, maybe less.

248
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Uh, we'll be going to a much wider, more public beta of cast blaster.

249
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,080
So stay tuned for that one.

250
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Next.

251
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Yeah.

252
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Well, let's talk about Bitcoin for a second.

253
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,080
I saw a beta release that came out yesterday, which is now, uh,

254
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,080
what does it the tracker list, uh, bit torrent, which means you no longer have to have a server,

255
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,080
set up with special software, uh, to basically, you know,

256
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:37,080
hand off the information on where to download for all these individual bit torrent, uh, clients.

257
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,080
So in theory, you could basically bake all of them.

258
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,080
I mean, I know that most of the, um, most of the iPodder software out there already understands bit torrent.

259
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,080
So I don't know if they have to upgrade or, or put anything in it,

260
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,080
probably not put any additional software in or change the software to work with this tracker list system.

261
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,080
I haven't experimented it with it yet, but it seems like something that we might even

262
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
bake into cast blaster just, you know, to have it there.

263
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Of course, the, the real problem is, you know, are you going to do multiple feeds for, um,

264
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,080
uh, for your, for your pod, you know, for your podcast feed, one with bit torrents and one with

265
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,080
regular web downloads and, you know, what happens, uh, if someone just clicks on a bit torrent link.

266
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,080
I mean, there's all kinds of things to be considered because as you know, really of the,

267
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,080
the iPodder traffic that I'm seeing, it's really only 20% of the people who are actually

268
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,080
listening to the show a lot of them are probably.

269
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,080
And if, you know, let me know how you're doing it, but I think a lot of people are downloading

270
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,080
the show when it comes out and either listening to it at their computer or they're dragging

271
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
over manually onto their, onto their MP3 player, not quite sure.

272
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Um, so, um, I don't know.

273
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
I'm very interested in, in bit torrent.

274
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Uh, it would be very cool if, if indeed we could turn that corner and make it work.

275
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,080
I'm just not sure how and, you know, that's like, guess that's what happens is once you

276
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
establish something so firmly, which you've done that with podcasting, you know,

277
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
people are going to, you know, they get used to it.

278
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
It's used to a certain way of working.

279
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
So I don't, I don't know if there's like a, under the covers way,

280
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,080
we can make that happen and make the switch and the hand off and so all of a sudden,

281
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
not, but I would certainly love to hear from my techy geeky friends if they have any

282
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
ideas.

283
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
And third.

284
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Oh, okay.

285
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I don't mind.

286
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm not, you know, there are lots of people who sit in the first class,

287
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,080
which I only sit in first class these days from upgraded, because I just, I, I think,

288
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,080
don't think it's worth it, but since I travel alone, I often do get the upgrade, because

289
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
these flights continuously.

290
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,080
I'm not one of these people who hates screaming children, not at all, not at all,

291
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,080
but man, there are some arrogant motherfuckers who do, I tell you that.

292
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
What's this now?

293
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Oh, yeah.

294
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
This is a, a long-form problem.

295
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,080
We're back when, when we didn't have to think, come on,

296
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
and don't be sick.

297
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,080
The boys on the bar, let me in and on,

298
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,080
on the banks of Chuck Creek, Chuck Creek.

299
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Hi, everybody. This is, uh, this is Dave from Chuck Creek.com.

300
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I just wanted to send out this note, because if you're not listening to Chuck Creek,

301
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,080
you're really missing out, because, you know, on our show, we make,

302
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,080
our own music, we make our own comedy skits, we make our own, whatever it is,

303
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,080
we need, you know, we do that, and we do it for you guys, and it's, it's all for you to

304
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,080
listen to, and we do it from the heart, you know, and, and here's a song,

305
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,080
I think this is from one of our first episodes, maybe one or two or three, and

306
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,080
it's one Gary wrote, and, uh, it's one that I really believe in, and one that I

307
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,080
thought, uh, probably his crowning piece, uh, and it's called,

308
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,080
I don't give a fuck about that toaster, and I wanted it to do not.

309
00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Well, you said to me, I think it was this morning, with this really, really,

310
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:36,080
really disgusting, don't in your voice, it sounded as though you were almost joking,

311
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:52,080
I'm a great big ball of friend, oh yeah, so anyway, you yelled at me with this disgusting

312
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,080
voice, that sounded like you were choking on a great big ball of thumb, and you said,

313
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:14,080
why don't you fix that toaster, it's always burning, burning, burning, burning

314
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:28,080
my toast, and I thought you were talking about your toast, but then again,

315
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:38,080
you were talking about your toast, and I should have known that because your voice was so

316
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:58,080
awful, yes, it was awful, and it made me sick, and I, I don't even know how,

317
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:24,080
to fix a fucking auto-steer, anyway, but then anyways, you came up with that amazing idea,

318
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:52,080
so we are in the trunk, after we planted all of our vegetables in the garden,

319
00:22:52,080 --> 00:23:12,080
we had like peas, and spinach, no kinds of other shit, it was quite the word glow,

320
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:30,080
it was quite the word glow, but then it was back to your idea, we got in the trunk,

321
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:50,080
my big trunk, my big trunk oh yeah, and you're idea wants to go to the coffee and don't

322
00:23:50,080 --> 00:24:10,080
just shut, we've got so much, it come in, because I wanted a coffee, just like you and I wanted to get my mind,

323
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:26,080
I've got a fucking toast, and I wanted a donor, and who cares if your toast gets burned,

324
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:35,080
I don't give a fuck any more about fucking toasters and burnin'

325
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:56,080
I love to have a donor with you, because we planted all kinds of vegetables and it was a long long day,

326
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:07,080
okay that's just one example of how hard we work for you, and I want you to do me a favor if you enjoyed that, send an email to Gary,

327
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:17,080
because in all the hundreds and hundreds of people that have heard that, have downloaded our show, not one person has emailed him to congratulate him about that song,

328
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:24,080
so I'd like you to do that for me, it's Gary at chubcreek.com, thanks for listening everybody.

329
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:31,080
So that immediately makes me want to have my own theme song, you know? I'd love to have one.

330
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:41,080
If you're sitting around strumming the guitar then make me a theme song, I'd love that, I really would.

331
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Okay, let me see a couple of emails I wanted to talk to you about, this is from Ronnie Roach, great name, by the way Ronnie,

332
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,080
says, hey Adam, I've been to subscribe to the Daily Source Code for a couple of months, now I love it, thank you very much.

333
00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:01,080
By the way, if you just click on the show every single day and download it and put it on your MP3 player manually, it can be an automatic process.

334
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Go to iPod or not to org and look for download iPod or go to podcast alley, and there's all different forms and versions that can run on anything from Linux to Mac to Windows,

335
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:19,080
what does it, Windows, mobile, I mean there's all kinds of iPoders, and it'll just basically you subscribe to the show,

336
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,080
whenever there's a new one it'll automatically show up on your player, which is very cool.

337
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:30,080
So back to Ronnie's email, I'll live on the outer banks of North Carolina and my wife and I helping out with the program that encourages youth to learn about aviation.

338
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,080
If a fifth grade student completes the program, they get to fly a sess now over the right brothers memorial.

339
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:44,080
I was wondering if you would consider coming to the area for one of the first flights or the right brothers anniversary celebration, seeing how you're a celebrity in all,

340
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
and also a flight enthusiast, I think would be a great fit.

341
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Well, I already had some more correspondence with their Ronnie, that happens in December.

342
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
Boy, what I love that, are you kidding me?

343
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Have you awesome to, you know, during the right brothers celebration, the guys like invented this shit?

344
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Yeah, that would be very, oh, by the way, there were people who flew before the right brothers and I guess, you know,

345
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,080
there's a whole invention thing.

346
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Another one from Brian Deamer, yet a story you wanted to share.

347
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,080
He says about a month ago, he was shopping at the Apple store in Soha Manhattan when a woman with a video camera asked him to answer a few questions.

348
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
He said, sure, did his thing and then went home.

349
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Well, he says, last week I got a call from a production company in LA, Apple might want me to be in the next commercial.

350
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
How cool he says.

351
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,080
So on Monday, Apple flew me to Los Angeles first class with about 50 other Mac geeks first class.

352
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,080
We all had a casting call and about 30 people got picked. Unfortunately, I wasn't one of them.

353
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
But the lucky ones are filming as we speak.

354
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,080
We all received a free iPod shuffle 512 for our time and it was great and a great LA experience.

355
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
I'm excited to see the new commercials.

356
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
I know every single person who'll be in them.

357
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,080
All in all, it says pretty good Mac geeks story, thought you would enjoy.

358
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Yeah, and I always wondered if they were actors or if they just picked people off the street.

359
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,080
But apparently, if you see someone video taping in an Apple store, could be your shot at fame.

360
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Maybe the next round right after they do this one.

361
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Eurovision song contest. That's the final thing I wanted to talk to you about.

362
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,080
This is something that's been going on for probably, I think it's 30 years.

363
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,080
There's a consortium called Eurovision.

364
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,080
It used to be, and I think it still is, all the public broadcasters from each different country in Europe.

365
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Once a year, and they had their own semi-finals and pre-rounds.

366
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,080
It's the precursor to idols, obviously, in their own country.

367
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
And then they send off a delegate.

368
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:38,080
That delegate will compete against delegates from all the other European countries in the union for the best song.

369
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Now, mind you, it's about the best song, not about the prettiest dress, the best outfit, the wackiest stage show, or the best singer.

370
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,080
And it's always been a very, very political thing.

371
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,080
For instance, the Netherlands, where I live for a long time,

372
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,080
will probably always vote for Belgium, who are their neighbors.

373
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
And the Belgians will probably vote for the Netherlands.

374
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,080
And then you've got a whole bunch of East Black countries, which, you know,

375
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,080
I think we created 20 more countries since the wall came down.

376
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
And they all kind of vote for each other.

377
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,080
It's also culturally, you know, you just may have more affinity with a song that sounds a little bit like,

378
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,080
you know, it's from your hood or from just around the corner.

379
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,080
And because these broadcasts were so long, they decided to chop it down, and if you'd lost,

380
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,080
or if you didn't make the top, I think the top 20, top 15 or top 20, I can't remember,

381
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
maybe it's even the top 10.

382
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Then you weren't allowed to participate in the next year's show.

383
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Unless you go through a special bonus round, which was held last night in Kiev,

384
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,080
that's where the finals will be held tomorrow night.

385
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,080
And I believe actually, they have to pay 150,000 euros or something like that.

386
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
It's very complicated.

387
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,080
And really, it's, it's a lot, right?

388
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,080
And mostly these countries take it very, very seriously.

389
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,080
In the United Kingdom, Terry Wogan, who does wake up with Wogan, it's a morning show,

390
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:59,080
which has been very successful for a long time here on BBC Radio 2.

391
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,080
He has a very dry British just fun sense of humor,

392
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,080
and he does the voiceover on the telecast.

393
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
And it's funny.

394
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,080
I mean, you're literally wedding yourself because he's just taking the piss out of every single contest.

395
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,080
And except, of course, for Britain's entry, right, if they actually make it into the final round,

396
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
which I think they are this year.

397
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,080
And so we watched yesterday because Glen is Grace, a Dutch girl who we know,

398
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,080
who actually had an unreality TV show, Adam's family two years ago.

399
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
And she's a fantastic singer.

400
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,080
The resurrection of Whitney Houston, I'd have to say, just really good great song.

401
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Well, she didn't make the cut last night, which was, it surprised everyone, actually.

402
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,080
Even, it wasn't Terry who did this particular round,

403
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
but even the voiceover on the BBC was like, well, you know, Holland didn't make it in.

404
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,080
And I think this has far reaching implications.

405
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,080
I believe that the Netherlands, and I was reading the newspapers this morning online,

406
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,080
I think the Netherlands is saying, what the fuck, man?

407
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,080
You know, this is the way we're getting treated in Europe.

408
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,080
We're definitely going to vote no on that referendum coming up next week,

409
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,080
which is about the European Constitution I've talked about this before.

410
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,080
If the Dutch say no to, you know, and this Constitution is, yeah, it's about liberties and freedoms, etc.

411
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,080
And, you know, work rights and shelter rights and you name it, human rights, basically.

412
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,080
But it's really about who has control of, you know, of what in the European Union,

413
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
which country has the most to say?

414
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Is it the guys who put the most money in, is the guys who have the most population?

415
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
You know, how does that work?

416
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Very complicated set of rules, and it doesn't sound very clean to me at all, at least from what I understand.

417
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,080
But, basically, all the members have to vote, yes, and say that they're for this,

418
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
and the French are coming up on June 1.

419
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:47,080
If the Dutch say no, the French could say no, and that could basically, you know, put the European Union back in the freezer,

420
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
which, I mean, that's going to affect everything.

421
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,080
It's going to affect economics, it's going to affect trade, it's going to affect a lot of things.

422
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
So it'll be very interesting to see.

423
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,080
And I truly believe that the Dutch who were already very disappointed with their own government

424
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,080
and probably going to vote no, just to punish their government, who, of course, you know, they all want, yes,

425
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,080
because they want, you know, to see the expansion mainly for economic reasons,

426
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,080
and which still have to be proven yet, I have to be fair.

427
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,080
I think the Dutch are going to be really down on the European Union right now,

428
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
all because of this silly ass song contest.

429
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,080
And, you know what, one of these days I get Patricia back on, we'll do another PPP podcast,

430
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,080
and we'll talk about her days participating in these song contest, which used to be very common around Europe.

431
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:37,080
You don't see him anymore, other than what's happened now with the reality type based television programming like idols.

432
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,080
That's kind of the only, the only thing we have left, but it's not really a national thing.

433
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,080
It really used to be, it's our country, and we want our country to win, and, you know, the whole voting thing and the call-up.

434
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,080
Hello, Moscow, may we have your votes, please?

435
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Ah, so exciting.

436
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Okay, how are we doing on time?

437
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
33 minutes perfect.

438
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,080
This is a song that CC Chapman turned me on to.

439
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,080
CC does the accident hash podcast.

440
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
You can find it at accident hash.com.

441
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,080
He's also working with us on setting up the pod safe music network, which I'm really excited about.

442
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
We've talked about that a couple times.

443
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
This is a guy whose name is Chance.

444
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:17,080
You can find him in my name is Chance.com, of course you'll find all that information in the show notes.

445
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
It's not entirely pod safe.

446
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,080
It would actually work very well on Coverville, because as long as you're paying an AskCap or BMI license, then it's all taken care of.

447
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,080
And you have permission by the guy himself, Chance, in this case, who doesn't have a record label, you know, he's independent.

448
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,080
As long as you have that permission to play it, then it's okay, but it's kind of borderline.

449
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
But the song is great.

450
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:45,080
It's, I think, I calculate the song is 21 years old by now, but it's still, it just, it kicks ass, particularly in this version.

451
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Here's Windows Cry.

452
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:27,080
And the most striking reasons for this, that you late, that you between me and you, you just leave me standing.

453
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,080
Alone in a world so cold.

454
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,080
Maybe I'm just too demanding.

455
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:43,080
Maybe I'm just like my father to go, maybe I'm just like my mother.

456
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,080
She's never said it's fine, never said it.

457
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Why do we scream at each other?

458
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:03,080
This is what it sounds like when does cry.

459
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Touch if you will, my stomach.

460
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Feel how it trembles inside.

461
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,080
You've got the borderline as all tied up.

462
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Don't make me chase you.

463
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Even though it's a pride, just being standing.

464
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,080
Alone in a world so cold.

465
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
What so?

466
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Maybe I'm just too demanding.

467
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Maybe I'm just like my father to go.

468
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Maybe I'm just like my mother.

469
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,080
She's never said it's fine.

470
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Why do we scream at each other?

471
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,080
This is what it sounds like when does cry.

472
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm just too demanding.

473
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,080
I'm just too demanding.

474
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Alone in a world so cold.

475
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Maybe I'm just too demanding.

476
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Maybe I'm just like my mother.

477
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:28,080
She's never said it's fine, never said it's fine.

478
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Why do we scream at each other?

479
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,080
This is what it sounds like when does cry.

480
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Touch if you will, my stomach.

481
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Feel how it trembles inside.

482
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,080

00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,080

Oh, ho, oh, do, oh, do, oh, do, oh, do.

504
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,900

505
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,020

506
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,360
