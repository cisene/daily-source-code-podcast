1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta share Charlie, two-fiber-two!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Please save me from people who've been told what to like and then like it.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
In my opinion, if you're over six years of age and you're still getting your music from the radio,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,500
something is desperately wrong with you.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,000
I can only hope that somehow MP3 players and file sharing will destroy FM radio

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the way they're destroying record companies.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then, even though the air will probably never be safe to breathe again,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
maybe it will be safer to listen to it.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There are no secrets.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Only information you don't get out of!

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Adam Curry!

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the next generation, radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I like to think I'm flying into this church.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It is Monday, October 3rd in the near.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Screw that.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In the year of our Lord, 2005, I sort of wanted to say,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
hey, everybody, how you doing?

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Come to you from Curry Cottage in Gilford, United Kingdom.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's right, back home with the girls.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is your daily source code, kind of free wheeling it today,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but I'm stacked up on promos and pod save tunes.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We are guaranteed to have a full show today.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Actually, we had something interesting happened this morning.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I didn't hear about it until early we had a eclipse.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was kind of weird, because it wasn't, of course, a full eclipse.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You have to be closer to the equator to really get that kind of stuff.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Definitely did go dark for about 10, 15 minutes.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As we were up bright and early, Christina has an audition this morning.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She had one at 8 o'clock, auditioning for a big school play,

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
which is based on the life of Lizzy Borden.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, yeah, that's my daughter for you.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So it's really weird.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Most of the animals include the birds,

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
primarily we're really kind of freaking out about this weird,

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
like twilight that we had around 730 this morning.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then at a quarter of eight it really started to set.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think 815 was the darkest moment.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And then it just started to get light again.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And the birds kind of acted up again.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It was one of those freaky, cool nature things.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That, of course, I completely forgot to take pictures of.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And that's why you've got such a small handy camera, you know?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm such a dork.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kicking it off with a mashup on today's source code.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This came from a DJ Quad.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sorry, I came from Phil who's promoting DJ Quad.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The mashup guy from Cat and the Girl.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And he suggests a mash-off spin-off.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's see what their entry is.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
When I want to see you,

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
something's high high.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't do very well.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When I feel the desire,

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I won't do what I want to do.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I won't do what I want to do.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I won't do what I want to do.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I won't do what I want to do.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I won't do what I want to do.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I won't do what I want to do.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I won't do what I want to do.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I won't do what I want to do.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I won't do what I want to do.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I won't do what I want to do.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I won't do what I want to do.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I won't do what I want to do.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I won't do what I want to do.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I won't do what I want to do.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I won't do what I want to do.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I won't do what I want to do.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I won't do what I want to do.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I won't do what I want to do.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I won't do what I want to do.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I won't do what I want to do.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I won't do what I want to do.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I won't do what I want to do.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I won't do what I want to do.

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I won't do what I want to do.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I won't do what I want to do.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I won't do what I want to do.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I won't do what I want to do.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I won't do what I want to do.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I won't do what I want to do.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I won't do what I want to do.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I won't do what I want to do.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I won't do what I want to do.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I won't do what I want to do.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I won't do what I want to do.

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I won't do what I want to do.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I won't do what I want to do.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I won't do what I want to do.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I won't do what I want to do.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I won't do what I want to do.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I won't do what I want to do.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I won't do what I want to do.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I won't do what I want to do.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I won't do what I want to do.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I won't do what I want to do.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I won't do what I want to do.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I won't do what I want to do.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I won't do what I want to do.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I won't do what I want to do.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I won't do what I want to do.

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I won't do what I want to do.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I won't do what I want to do.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I won't do what I want to do.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I won't do what I want to do.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I won't do what I want to do.

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I won't do what I want to do.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I won't do what I want to do.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I won't do what I want to do.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I won't do what I want to do.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I won't do what I want to do.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
God bless.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, man.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That fusing sound feels like me.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
My ears are cooked through my butt.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's really rough.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The full story is that Phil Eugenio is sent to me for the sea.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He said that jam to this broth.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's have a mashup contest.

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
DJ Quad of Keith and the Gorillir vs Art that guy tries to mash up.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He's okay, but lowerly flan of Keith and the Gorillir can mash up.

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Like none other.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Just listen.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,240
of mashuptown.com, which is way different from him doing all the mashups that I play.

127
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
So I don't think that'll be any competition we want to enter into.

128
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
This was kind of cool though, but it seemed like I was missing at least a quarter of the mashup

129
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,920
that just wasn't a part of the file that was sent.

130
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,520
But I liked it.

131
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,920
I liked it definitely, very, very cool.

132
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm liking the mashups.

133
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,560
So back now, back for a couple of days, of course I got inside of the morning, I'd slept

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,520
for like five hours on the plane, which was pretty good.

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,800
Seeing as it's only only a nine and a half hour flight, you know, with your, I was

136
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,760
fall asleep the minute the engines rev up though.

137
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,520
That's, you know, the minute you hit rotation from the runway, when the, when the nose wheel

138
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,840
lifts off, I'm asleep, I'm asleep for a half an hour an hour, you know, and then I'm

139
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,520
going to wake up and get into the vibe and what I watched the movie, the hell that

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
I watched.

141
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,160
I don't remember what it was, I can't remember what I watched.

142
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,440
But slept well, got in around, you know, the typical 1030, customs was pretty busy, even

143
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
for the fast track.

144
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,680
We've talked about that, right?

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,600
It's the pink little slip you get and then you can go through a special line, but even

146
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,080
the fast track was slow.

147
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,680
And back at the cottage round 12, it was great seeing the girls.

148
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,080
We had a great weekend, it was great catching up, we just talk and talk and talk and talk

149
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,160
and talk and talk and so much that on Sunday, Patricia, I did a special podcast going

150
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,400
through an hours worth of pod save music that I've played over the past couple of weeks

151
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,280
and basically getting her input on it, which was kind of interesting.

152
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,720
And I realized that you may be listening, you may be listening to that today instead of

153
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,120
this show, depending on what you, what kind of time you had on your Sunday, to listen

154
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,680
to an hour of our, our futsing around, but it was fun.

155
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,120
I love doing shows with Patricia and to maybe I can get on more often, but it did get

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,920
a whole, whole thought process rolling in my head about pod safe music and production,

157
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,640
and not talking about audio quality, but, you know, as Patricia would call it, another

158
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,360
set of ears, you know, just someone listening to stuff, which, of course, is a value

159
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,560
ad that record companies and ANR people give to their artists, which, you know, we don't

160
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,040
really have, well, I guess we have a super benefit as it pertains to pod safe music because

161
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,200
you have a whole audience that will work with you on Chris, like software.

162
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,840
There's no, I don't see any difference between creating a software program, you know,

163
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,800
why shouldn't you have a beta of the song?

164
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
I think you can definitely have it.

165
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Here's the beta.

166
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,200
We used to call that a demo, but there was really nothing between demo and release candidate.

167
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,080
It was always that's it, you know, you go from, from the O.1 version straight to the

168
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
1.0 version.

169
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,760
Maybe we should consider more, had this more of it be more of an iterative process.

170
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,800
I don't even know what that means, but it sounds pretty expensive.

171
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,160
I don't know what that means, but it sounds pretty expensive.

172
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
I don't know what that means, but it sounds pretty expensive.

173
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Anyway, just a thought.

174
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
And we'll get to that little bit later on.

175
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I have some ideas for the pod safe music networks and stuff that I want to throw out there

176
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,440
and see what comes back.

177
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,840
As I said, plenty of promo is lined up.

178
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
I got it a question the other day, someone said, you know, you asked for promo is what?

179
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
It is a promo.

180
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,120
I said, well, you should listen to the source code because I play a lot of them.

181
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:47,200
And promo is basically small little audio vignettes or the column of commercial.

182
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
There you go.

183
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,680
It's an advertisement for your show.

184
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,360
It's a way to hook people into, to getting them to listen to and hopefully subscribe

185
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,360
to your show, to your podcast.

186
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,680
And there's many ways to do it.

187
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,080
One way is to play snippets and say, you know, here's the stuff you're missing if

188
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,320
you don't listen to our show immediately and the other one is to really show what kind

189
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,080
of personality you are or maybe have multiple people.

190
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,760
There's a whole bunch of ways to do it.

191
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:21,080
Ways like, well, you could always use this tactic.

192
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
This is John Long.

193
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,360
I am wanting to know whether you understand Hawkins.

194
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,520
As Lucy binangilana, I see Taiwan and Langheil, a healthy alcoholic want to see Lu,

195
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,960
Pyunnamil, J-o, Hong Kong.

196
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,440
I don't understand Hawkins.

197
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,520
For a time, I want to know how much Arthur is most in Australia but I don't know

198
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,240
what the look up Mc Doom is looking for.

199
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,920
She said Mouse, a colored Runner, dio, a可以, a mencioner, a person.

200
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,800
That's her standard, a right approach.

201
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,440
The best way to understand Hawkins is to build a journey.

202
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,160
Lure Theory and Autism Analysis.

203
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,000
Take off your helmets.

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Just do it.

205
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
And it's too smooth to see.

206
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Reddit and so on.

207
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:10,440
You have your PE and ANG, H-O-K-K-I-E-N.com, okay, bye, everyone.

208
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,440
So there was just a message out there to all the Huck-In people who understand Huck-In.

209
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm studying a new podcast.

210
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm studying a new podcast called PenangHuck-In.com, PE-N-A-N-G, H-O-K-K-I-E-N.com.

211
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,440
It's all about Huck-In podcast.

212
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Gender Parts

213
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Bump bridge down there.

214
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
There isn't a sûre.

215
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,440
It thrown in the backstage and the acting boss is behind.

216
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
H-O-K-I-N-F-H-O.

217
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Content that will make you squeeze the dog and burp your mother.

218
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,440
So, what have you missed in the past month by not listening to the financial aid podcast?

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,940
We've talked about, and given you the secrets too, finding over $25 million in scholarships,

220
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,340
you could have gone to college for free.

221
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Financial aid podcast listeners raised over $10,000 in hurricane assistance funds, and you

222
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
could have been a part of that.

223
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,300
We had ourselves a jobcast from the opposite end of the spectrum covering four jobs seeking

224
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,300
strategies, six resume tips, and four insider secrets to landing the jobs you want in

225
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,200
as little as two weeks.

226
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,600
You missed eight power tips for increasing your gas mileage to save money commuting.

227
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,900
You didn't get a copy of our scholarship search secrets ebook, distributed only in our RSS

228
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
speed.

229
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,300
You missed an opportunity to get a free car from Motorola.

230
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,800
You didn't learn how to reduce the taxes you pay every year with education tax credits.

231
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,300
And you missed the debut of 90 different pod safe songs from artists across the spectrum,

232
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,600
from God Rock to folk via the pod safe music network.

233
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,600
So subscribe now to the financial aid podcast at www.financialaidpodcast.com.

234
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Because otherwise, who knows what you'll miss in October if you don't.

235
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
This week on the squad cast, we take on the snooze chewing tobacco challenge.

236
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
By the way, didn't you describe what this looks like to the folks at home and we'll take a

237
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
serious drag of coffee grind?

238
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
It does look like a little tiny.

239
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
It's like a bag of coffee.

240
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
You can do one or two things now to it.

241
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
You can do it.

242
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
You know what?

243
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You know what I'm going to do?

244
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
What?

245
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I'm going to beg you both.

246
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm going to beg you both.

247
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Unless you both want to die in the next four minutes.

248
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Shut the fuck up.

249
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
I've locked mine into the front of my jaw.

250
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
You know, it just sound like like a tard.

251
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
You sound like you've had a stroke.

252
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,600
They're currently at the number nine show.

253
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Are we after tonight's episode?

254
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
We are short to never see the top 10 again.

255
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
No, you will.

256
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
You just will as the Anthony and Larry Shaw.

257
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Mine is us.

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
We're going to be late us.

259
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Nancy and Barbara passed out.

260
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I mean Nancy and Barbara.

261
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Brian wants to know which one he is.

262
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Squad cast, squad cast.

263
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Gmail.com.

264
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Squad cast, squad cast, dot com.

265
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Who?

266
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Okay.

267
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Some fine examples of promos there.

268
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
That's really here.

269
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Well, I read mainly.

270
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,600
And also here, you know, podcasters about the daily source code and one of the common

271
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
complaints is, you know, who the hell cares about Adam Curry's life?

272
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Well, of course, that's not the point.

273
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
The point is this is the show where if you're new to pod casting and you want to

274
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
find out about some interesting shows, you might want to listen to.

275
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Here's the place to pick them up through listening to promos.

276
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,600
And of course, going to the show notes and you know, finding out where to

277
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
where to find these shows.

278
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,600
And the other part is, you know, trying to develop pod casting.

279
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
We are not done.

280
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I was talking to Andrew Grummit this morning.

281
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,600
He was on his way out to San Francisco.

282
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
He's going to come by the pod show offices.

283
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
It's going to be there for a week or so.

284
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
And we're going to work on ways that we can work together.

285
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,600
And it's just so much more to do as it when it comes to pod casting.

286
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
So, and primarily from the, of course, from the pod cast or side.

287
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,600
The work that we've been doing with Mike on cast blaster is.

288
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I think an example of that, how much and you can pretty much see what we're going with with

289
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
cast blaster.

290
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
It's going to be a fully integrated solution.

291
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Obviously, you won't have to worry about creating RSS feeds and show blogs and up

292
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
FTP and uploading and doing ID3 tags.

293
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,600
All of that will just be built into one simple process.

294
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,600
You know, step one step two and there is no step three.

295
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,600
But on the listener side, we're far from done.

296
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,600
You know, and there's a reason why if you look at, if you look at the television networks this past week in the

297
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
States, although I don't have a television, I pretty much know it's always the same anyway.

298
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,600
So, they roll out their new lineup and there's, there's a lot of promo going on there, boy.

299
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I tell you, the cool thing about pod casting is you only have to promo once.

300
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Once you get the person to subscribe to your show, you're pretty much,

301
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,600
sure that you've got them, you know, that's your audience.

302
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,600
And then, if they don't like it, then they'll unsubscribe.

303
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Which, by the way, is one thing that we could really do.

304
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Wouldn't that be cool if you knew if someone unsubscribe?

305
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Yeah, I'd love to know that.

306
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I'd love to be able to say, hey, I saw you unsubscribe.

307
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Is there a reason why?

308
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Is there anything I can do to make it better to bring you back?

309
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,600
And, of course, on mainstream media, traditional broadcast radio and television,

310
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
there is no subscription.

311
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Well, there is, of course, with Tivo.

312
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
That's, I guess that's true.

313
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,600
But there is, you know, they continuously have to promo to keep your attention.

314
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,600
And there's a reason why stuff comes back at the same time every week, you know, that's, so they can,

315
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
so you can be trained.

316
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
But now we just train our devices much, much easier, unlike it.

317
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,600
A couple of emails about bio diesel.

318
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Just going through the Gmail here.

319
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Hold on a second.

320
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Let me turn the laptop a bit.

321
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Let's see, this is from Danny Boyle.

322
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Did you know that oil from hemp seeds is one of the highest part in the pun.

323
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,600
BTUs per unit of all the bio fuels and it grows like a weed.

324
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Says Danny Boyle.

325
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Well, of course.

326
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
That would make, of course it does.

327
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,600
In fact, I once did a documentary in Jamaica about Bob Marley and met up with,

328
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
oh man, he was one of his best friends.

329
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
And I've totally forgetting his name.

330
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
He runs the the museum at Marley's house in Kingston.

331
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,600
And he said, you know, this, the Oli herb.

332
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
It burns hotter than coal.

333
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,600
And I've never forgotten that.

334
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Another thing about, I have to read you this article about bio fuel.

335
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Hold on.

336
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I just got to click on this link.

337
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
A couple of people sent me this one.

338
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
See, who sent this?

339
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
This is from Gary Hall.

340
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Yeah.

341
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,600
And Gary sent me this link about French President Jacques Girac.

342
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I'll just read this to you.

343
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
He's joined the country.

344
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
France is push to boost bio fuel use.

345
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Converting his own luxury Citroen C6 saloon, which is a huge, huge car.

346
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
And many of his official scars to run on cleaner burning bio diesel.

347
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Fuel pumps at his Aleyzay Palace in Central Paris have been modified to provide the alternative fuel.

348
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
The President's car runs with bio diesel made from rapeseed.

349
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
As do half the Aleyzay cars, a spokeswoman said on Friday.

350
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,600
France, Europe's biggest agricultural producer, has announced plans to become Europe's leading bio fuel maker by 2010.

351
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
When it wants, a green fuel is to fill 7% of total consumption.

352
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
France produces both bio diesel made from mostly rapeseed.

353
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,600
An ethanol derived from sugar beet or cereals.

354
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
And of course, Shirok is a former agricultural minister.

355
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
And so he's a big champion of the farmers' causes.

356
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
That's a story on the Yahoo, which I guess is what it's at AP.

357
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
It's an AP, a Reuters story.

358
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
That's pretty interesting, though.

359
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
And it isn't detrue.

360
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I've gotten all the details now.

361
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,600
If you use vegetable oil as fuel for your vehicle in the United Kingdom,

362
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
you have to pay the tax man.

363
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
And there's actually a form that you fill out and send the check to.

364
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
TruckerLew from truckerLew.com.

365
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Hey, truckerLew.

366
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,600
In the rain, this thing to your podcast here for about the last month or so.

367
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
And you've been talking a lot about bio diesel.

368
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
And I'm all 4 bio diesel.

369
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,600
I think bio diesel would definitely be the way to go.

370
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,600
And here in the United States, tractor trailers, or commercial motor vehicles,

371
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:51,600
are the number one consumer of diesel in here in the United States.

372
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,600
And anything to get the price to drop would be excellent.

373
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I don't have to worry too much about the price of a diesel,

374
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
but I'm driving a company vehicle.

375
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
So I don't actually have to pay for the fuel out of my pocket,

376
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
but my company does.

377
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,600
So many money that they can save means more money in my pocket,

378
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
because I can give me raises at a later date.

379
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,600
And diesel is cheaper in the United States,

380
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,600
simply because car, you know,

381
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,600
automobiles use more gasoline here than they do diesel.

382
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,600
And I don't know if it's that way in the United Kingdom,

383
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,600
but I do have one question about bio diesel.

384
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:51,600
And this would affect the average homemaker or home producer of bio diesel.

385
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I don't, you may have addressed this before, I don't know,

386
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,600
but any United States when you're operating a motor vehicle,

387
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,600
whether it's commercial or private motor vehicle on any public road,

388
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
the fuel that you use or the fuel that you purchase.

389
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,600
When you purchase the fuel, you're paying taxes,

390
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,600
as well as paying for the price of the actual fuel,

391
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,600
which can be anywhere from a 40 to 80 cents of tax per gallon.

392
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,600
When you're operating a motor vehicle and you're using fuel

393
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
that you have not purchased,

394
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,600
that means that you're not paying the taxes on it.

395
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,600
And if you're not paying the taxes on it,

396
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
you're operating the motor vehicle on the highway.

397
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,600
That opens up to the potential of a tax evasion.

398
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,600
And I'm not sure if you looked up the rules on that.

399
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Yeah, that's the way that I understand it.

400
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
I could be entirely wrong.

401
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I think it's exactly what's happening here in the UK,

402
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,600
where if you use a certain substance as fuel,

403
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
you have to pay tax over it.

404
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,600
I mean, that's something that is nothing to do with the scarcity of a natural resource.

405
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
That's just taxes, you can put taxes on anything.

406
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
There are taxes on cigarettes, taxes on booze,

407
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
so why not taxes on biofuels?

408
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
But that's a different gain.

409
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,600
That's something that you got to change at the voting booth.

410
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I'm sorry about that.

411
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Wow, really overmodulated.

412
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Yeah, something at the voting booth that you got to get your guys in there who are going to represent what you think is fair.

413
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I want to come to taxation.

414
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
And by the way, even though you're driving a company truck,

415
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
higher fuel prices are going to just put strain on the company.

416
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
If it doesn't affect your future compensation,

417
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
it could affect many jobs.

418
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
That's just the way it goes.

419
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
It really sucks.

420
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
So I'm way, I think it's a perfect way to go.

421
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
And then if the government puts taxes on biofuels,

422
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
well that's different, that's a different issue.

423
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,600
It's not that the natural resource has doubled in price

424
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
in a very short amount of time.

425
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Well, not double, I guess.

426
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Well, actually $60.

427
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
I've seen $30 barrel of oil in the last five years,

428
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I think.

429
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
So yeah, it has pretty much doubled.

430
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
So yeah, if there's a tax on it,

431
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
you'll have to pay a tax for it.

432
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,600
But until there's a tax, you don't have to, I guess.

433
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,600
But I figured I just dropped this little voice message.

434
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,600
And see if you have anything to say about that.

435
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,600
And whether or not you've actually explored it.

436
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,600
So there's more things than just making it.

437
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
There's a lot of legal ramifications in there.

438
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,600
And by the way, it is the United States of America.

439
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
We take matters into our own hands, dammit.

440
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
If we want to crap in our tanks to make it go and avoid all those

441
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,600
prices, expensive fuels, we'll do it.

442
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
And then if we want need to talk tax, we will.

443
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,600
That need to be, that need to be explored.

444
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:17,600
So if you get a chance to explore this, taking, putting it up in your podcast

445
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,600
and let everybody know because I'm interested in it.

446
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
I do have a diesel vehicle at home.

447
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,600
And if I could figure out a way to cheaply produce my own,

448
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,600
my own biodiesel, I do that for the same way.

449
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
I have to be home to do it.

450
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
I'm driving a tractor trailer.

451
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,600
And I'm gone four weeks out of the month.

452
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
So I'm only home three days or so a month.

453
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Damn.

454
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
You hear that?

455
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
I thought I had it bad with two weeks on two weeks off,

456
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
but home three days of the month, dude.

457
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Whew, that's rough.

458
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,600
You must take a month off somewhere to be with your family, I hope.

459
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
That's the backbone, man.

460
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Truckers backbone of America.

461
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Backbone of any country, really, I guess.

462
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600
That's a rough gig.

463
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Anyway, I just figured I'd bring that to your attention

464
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,600
and see what your input was on that.

465
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,600
And you know, being in the trucking industry,

466
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,600
diesel production is very important to me.

467
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,600
You can check me out over at truckerlude.com.

468
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
And I do kind of like a stream of consciousness type podcast.

469
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,600
And so I'm always talking about the trucking industry over there.

470
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,600
So I guess as about all we got for now,

471
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
we'll talk to you later.

472
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm going to post this up for a file,

473
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
and I'm going to email a link to you here.

474
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,600
So I hope you have fun and we'll talk to you later.

475
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Appreciate it.

476
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Truckerlude?

477
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
That's another great way to promote your show.

478
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Feedback, that's something we're talking about here.

479
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,600
So everything continues.

480
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
I encourage anyone who has links to home-making,

481
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,600
biodiesel websites and kits and organizations.

482
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
To put them up in the show notes on the wiki show notes,

483
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,600
which actually a couple of people have come to me and said,

484
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
hey, my name's wiki.

485
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,600
So I guess I got to figure out something

486
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
for those folks to do.

487
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Who knows?

488
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,600
It turns out it's a pretty common Hawaiian name.

489
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,600
So that was really smart of me, A.

490
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Let me see.

491
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I wanted to tell you a story about something that was relative to.

492
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
You know, let me see.

493
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Why don't we take a break?

494
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Why don't we do something?

495
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Let's just break the rhythm here for a second

496
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
and get into some non-podsave music.

497
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Hello.

498
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Hello.

499
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
You need to start.

500
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
There we go.

501
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Backtracks podcast.

502
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,600
So you think you know your hits backwards and forwards?

503
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
No, I just...

504
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Yeah, right.

505
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
You're listening to the Backtracks podcast exclusively

506
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,600
on the daily source code with Adam Curry.

507
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Hey, Adam.

508
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Hey, are you doing it?

509
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
You're doing pretty good.

510
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,600
We might have to make this a little bit more difficult for you.

511
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Please.

512
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Okay.

513
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Challenge me.

514
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Number one.

515
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
I know it already.

516
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Oh, yeah.

517
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Um, that is Robbie Neville with St. Levy.

518
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
St. Levy.

519
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
St. Levy.

520
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Number two.

521
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Sounds like Thomas Goldby.

522
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Let me come back to you.

523
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Time's up.

524
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Number three.

525
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
You can hear it.

526
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Car Wash Rose Royce.

527
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
I know I got to do it.

528
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Time's up.

529
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Okay, here are the answers.

530
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Number one.

531
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Goldby.

532
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Uh-huh.

533
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Say Love E.

534
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
And here's number two.

535
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Oh, okay.

536
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
You're coming, saw.

537
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Number three.

538
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Are you ready?

539
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Are you ready?

540
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Are you ready?

541
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Are you ready?

542
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Uh-huh.

543
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Uh-huh.

544
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Oh, uh-huh.

545
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Oh, uh-huh.

546
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Oh, uh-huh.

547
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Oh, uh-huh.

548
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
So how did you do, Adam?

549
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
You're out of three.

550
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Not bad.

551
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Thanks for joining us on this week's Backtrack Spotcast quiz.

Catch you next time.

554
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Backtrack Spotcast.

555
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Spin it back.

556
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,600
I love the production of that.

557
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Uh-huh.

558
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm telling you, I'm pretty good at that.

559
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Let's see a couple of emails about my Blackberry.

560
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
How's it doing?

561
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Did it work?

562
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Uh, yes it did.

563
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Very, very pleased with the performance of the Blackberry arrived in the UK email work.

564
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Voice mail worked.

565
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Phone calls worked.

566
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,400
Um, I told you I had this whole setup with Skype, which, because of course I have my UK cell phone,

567
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
which I would take with me.

568
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,400
I mean, I've, I have my numbers were all over the map and, and the problem really is,

569
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:55,600
and this does really piss me off, is you can get your, you know, so here's T mobile, right?

570
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
It doesn't matter because they all do the same, where there's a vote of phone, orange,

571
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,600
T mobile, you know, or in the States, Verizon, uh, singular is actually the best for us,

572
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
and I'll tell you why.

573
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Because I have, so I have my team mobile, uh, my MDA.

574
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,600
I've gotten, you know, my data accounts and everything.

575
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:17,600
And when you go overseas, you get penalized that to no end, uh, for using your phone,

576
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,600
which, of course, has driven me to, to get a provider over in the States.

577
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
You know, it's so stupid.

578
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
They charred.

579
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
They want to charge me.

580
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,600
See, if I call from London to the US, anywhere in the US, you can pay an extra, you know,

581
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
10 a month or something, and then you get 10 cents.

582
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,600
20 US dollar cents, by the way, I give a take.

583
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Uh, which is still expensive to call any number in the US.

584
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Now, when you take your phone over there, it'll cost you 90 pens.

585
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:51,600
So almost like a buck 80 to call, uh, overseas from, uh, from the US.

586
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,600
So to call back, it cost you a multiple of what it cost to call from the UK to the States.

587
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
So of course, we know that's horseshit.

588
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,600
And incoming calls cost 80 pens, a buck 50 buck 60 for an ink per minute.

589
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Per minute for an incoming call.

590
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,600
You know, and so, um, they're losing out.

591
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,600
It's so incredibly dumb the way they do this.

592
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,600
So you, there's no, really, there is no global carrier, you know, and I just don't understand

593
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
why they can't get that together.

594
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,600
You know, why the prices, I mean, are they just trying to rape consumers?

595
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Because we're not stupid.

596
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,600
I mean, yeah, for ease of use, maybe I'll take a call or two.

597
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
But, you know, so now here's how I've set it up.

598
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,600
When someone calls my UK cell phone, that automatically forwards to a UK Skype in number,

599
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
which means it's a very cheap call.

600
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Because of course, you know, when you're using your cell phone over here and calling,

601
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,600
local, you know, UK numbers that are not going to charge a hell of a lot for that.

602
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,600
The cell phone company's finally figured that one out.

603
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,600
But then I have Skype set up so that it forwards through Skype out to my US cell phone.

604
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
How cool is that?

605
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,600
So the total charges are maybe per minute.

606
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I think it's two cents, two euro cents per minute to Skype out to the states.

607
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:19,600
And it's probably about, um, it's probably for the local call, the forward that I'm doing

608
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
from a UK local, the UK local.

609
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
It's probably about 10 pens.

610
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,600
So it's still, you know, a good $25, 30 US dollar cents to do this.

611
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,600
But, you know, look, the look is making the money.

612
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
You know, Skype is making the money on this.

613
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
It's totally stupid.

614
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Just can't believe.

615
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
And then when I call home, I call the Skype in number.

616
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,600
I got one of those Skype phones for Patricia, one of those cordless Skype phones.

617
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
And I call just a US based number.

618
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,600
And it actually sounds better than when I call her over the BT phone line.

619
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
It's not, man.

620
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
I'm telling you.

621
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
It's freaking nuts.

622
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Wow.

623
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,600
It's so simple to see when you're down here in the trenches with the rest of the users of the technology.

624
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Let me see if there's anything else that I wanted to hit here.

625
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
There was something about education.

626
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Yeah, it's always nice to see that.

627
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,600
From Stephen C. Graves, I guess it's C.

628
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
I guess it's C. Graves.

629
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Just wanted to share a new avenue that podcasting is taking on here.

630
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,600
My university at College of Education has incorporated podcasting to help their students and faculty receive information and training.

631
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,600
It's good content, especially for the future teachers here.

632
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Just want to share that with you.

633
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
It's great to see podcasting taken off like this.

634
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,600
And I'll put a link to this in the show notes.

635
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,600
It's EDUC.ttu.edu slash podcasts.

636
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Very cool.

637
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Yeah, I want to be very clear that this podcasting thing is definitely bigger than selling iPods.

638
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
There's a lot more to it.

639
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm so excited about all the things that are going to come and I can almost predict them.

640
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
I can see them happening.

641
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
And part of that is about music.

642
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
And we're going to talk about that in just a couple minutes.

643
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,600
This is Bob Robinson of the Pan and Community Church Service podcast.

644
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,600
You recall a couple of weeks ago I sent you an email talking about being picked to be an Arbitron ratings family.

645
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Well, the diary's came and we spent our week filling out time.

646
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Hold on, let me just interject here.

647
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:25,600
So what he did, what Bob Robinson did is he sent me an email that he'd been chosen as one of the select families or persons, I guess,

648
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
to participate in the Arbitron ratings.

649
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Are the Nielsen's of radio and the way they're done is by filling out a diary.

650
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,600
So they give you a special diary and you have to write down what you listen to.

651
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
And the stations get credit for all kinds of things.

652
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
They get credit for call letters.

653
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,600
There's different credit if you can name it air personality that you heard.

654
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,600
There's all kinds of different, different things that the stations get varying degrees of credit for.

655
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:57,600
And that's how they determine this magical number of how many people are listening to the station by the quarter hour.

656
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Remember, so you're probably writing down on the diary by the quarter hour.

657
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,600
What you listen to from 8 to 8 to 15 in the morning, 815 to 830 in the morning.

658
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
I was to get some more background on that from Bob.

659
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,600
I'd love to know what a diary looks like and I've never actually held one in my hands.

660
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,600
So he was going to fill in the podcast that he listened to as well.

661
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,600
So let's see what Bob has to say here.

662
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
And a couple of interesting results came out.

663
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,600
First of all, I do notice that I'm more than 50% podcast versus radio listener.

664
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,600
It's been about 60% of my time listening to podcast versus 40 over the regular radio.

665
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
And that's just been a past six months or so.

666
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Another interesting point is my attention span for either podcast or radio seems to be about 20 minutes.

667
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,600
So 20 minutes or 40 minutes maybe is a really good time duration for individual podcast shows.

668
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,600
And finally, the arbitron folks did provide a little section in the back of the diary to put down any kind of comments we wanted to.

669
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,600
So I filled them in on what podcasting is and we'll see if it shows up as a blip on their ratings radar.

670
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
All right.

671
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,600
I'll leave you with a couple of plugs in the patent community church service podcast and Sunday word come to you both on Sundays.

672
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:10,600
And friend of mine, MB is the host of the fairytale corner podcast where they do classic original and modern fairytales.

673
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Right now, MB is reading one of her very own original fairytales.

674
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
You sure to check it out on iTunes in the family section.

675
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Thanks a lot Adam.

676
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
You have a great day.

677
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Oh, I rev.

678
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Nice processing, by the way.

679
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Holy moly.

680
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,600
You got a noise gate there, son.

681
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
That sounded bad.

682
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
That sounded pretty aggressive.

683
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
I like it though.

684
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:44,600
And that, by the way, that's something interesting to talk about that sound processing really or just audio in general.

685
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
We've, so we discovered our microphones.

686
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:53,600
We discovered with that that hole in your laptop is for and we're putting it to great use.

687
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:02,600
But just like publishing in print and we talk about this a lot at pod show publishing in print or word processing.

688
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
That's a good example.

689
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
It's a good analogy actually.

690
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,600
So when you're making a document and you want to communicate something, it's, you know, it's not just words that would be a dot txt file.

691
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:26,600
But even in that, the way you space things, you know, you might put a bullet point in front of one certain item that you want to highlight and of course if you have a rich document.

692
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Then you have italics and bold and fonts and colors and all kinds of things you can do to really get your message across and this all exists in audio as well.

693
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,600
We're learning all of this stuff which is okay.

694
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:51,600
You know, it's been around for a long time. There's a lot of what programmers would call prior art would trademark attorneys would also call prior art.

695
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:58,600
You know, so you can say something and you want a nonciated or you want to, you know, add it like this is an important thing. I want you to listen to it.

696
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Okay.

697
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Sing, say hello.

698
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Right?

699
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Can be used for good and for evil.

700
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,600
And so processing is a part of that.

701
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:18,600
You're sound, you know, and that could be whatever you want it to be, whatever, whatever floats your boat, I guess.

702
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Now, about the pod safe music network.

703
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Yesterday, while Patricia and I were doing this kind of review of pod safe music that I'd played on the show, we accidentally played a nonpod safe song, I'll explain why.

704
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Because it was a cover version.

705
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Now, in this whole discussion about playing pod safe or nonpod safe music on podcast, here's my ultimate view point. I see that there are really two.

706
00:37:49,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Two types of rights. There's the performance rights, which means, you know, when you use a song, to basically, as a derivative work, I should, why don't have to go into legal terms.

707
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:14,600
So, if you want to use a song just to sing it yourself and to sing that at a concert or sing it for your friends or whatever, you know, essentially you're using someone else's work.

708
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Now, there's all kinds of fair uses in there. But in my case, as this podcast eventually will start to generate revenue, it's only fair that if you're using someone else's work, it's only fair that they're compensated for that. If you're using someone else's work for profit.

709
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Now, as it pertains to artists, there are lots and lots and lots of artists out there who may not, who may be great artists, but may not have the songwriting or composing talent.

710
00:38:46,600 --> 00:39:02,600
And by the way, you know, I don't look at songs as CDs or tracks. It's a song and a great song is a great song and a great song could be performed and produced and recorded in many many different ways.

711
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,600
And that's really the thing that carries through all the ages is the song, not that particular recording.

712
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:18,600
There are songs that have been covered eight, nine, maybe even ten times. There are classics that, well, shoot classical music just as an example is basically covered all the time.

713
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:27,600
And in that case, there's no one left to pay because the copyrights, you know, there's no more copyrights in most cases in the public domain.

714
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Now, as it, when it comes to the pod save music network, okay, so let's talk about so the other right is the fact that you're using someone's product.

715
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:46,600
So the product, of course, is the song or is the track that is a combination of the musicians, the singers, and also the authors and the composers of the song.

716
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:55,600
So let's say, and that's what ASCAP and BMI are for is for the, it's for the composers and the authors of the song, don't put that over to the left for a second.

717
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:07,600
So right now we're seeing lots of artists coming in saying, hey, I'm willing to give up the, the mechanical rights, the fact that you're using a product of theirs in a show.

718
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:22,600
They're willing to give that up for the promotional value that, that a podcast can bring when a podcast or place a song because, of course, where most of your money is made at the end of the day as an artist is performing in front of live audiences.

719
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Now, if you can get into selling millions and millions and millions and keep that up, yeah, then it becomes a different game.

720
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:43,600
But by the way, sales of CDs or tracks direct to the consumer, these days are very interesting because your overhead is so low as an artist, you can keep 90% of the total purchase price in your pocket.

721
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:54,600
And then you have a little bit of cost on actually creating the CDs, but, you know, the physical product or if you want to sell by the track or some other means, it's all possible.

722
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:03,600
So let's presume that the artists are willing to give up that right for the promotional value, which is pretty much the way it works on radio today.

723
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Radio stations do not pay the record companies or anybody else for playing the song.

724
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:17,600
They do pay, pay, ask cap and be a mile. There's two organizations and I don't think anyone belongs to both. You belong to either ask cap or be a mile.

725
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:26,600
And what they do is they track the usage of songs, not of the records, but of songs.

726
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,600
So if it's played in a bar, it's, of course, enhancing the atmosphere of the bar and the bar has revenue.

727
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:43,600
And so they have a business thanks in part to the songs. And so they pay not, you know, not a whole bunch, but they pay some money, which is in proportion to whatever the revenue is coming in.

728
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,600
It's probably going to be one to two percent of revenue of gross revenue.

729
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,600
And it's the same if you hear music and an elevator. I mean, all of that is paid for.

730
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,600
And they have guys who actually go out on this, they'll go by fairs and, you know, they have their collection agency.

731
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,600
That's basically what they are. They got the rules down and everyone agrees on it.

732
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,600
And I'm not against that. I think that, you know, absolutely.

733
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:16,600
And I think this fair use, if you're just, you know, hosing around and, you know, and not making any money using the song.

734
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I think that, you know, there should be fair use that you don't have to pay anything. You shouldn't have to pay for something if you're not making money off of it.

735
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Okay. So that's a long-winded wind up to the point I want to make.

736
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,600
And then we really got to move along.

737
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,600
And I believe the pod safe music network should go out. And of course, that's pod show.

738
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,600
And I'm going to talk about this today. In fact, we're going to get on it.

739
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,600
I think we should go out. And we should cut a deal with ASCAP and with BMI.

740
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:53,600
So that podcasters can use songs as long as they also have the right to play the actual product.

741
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:02,600
So that way artists can, you know, really introduce themselves to an audience and not just be limited by their own songs, but they can get other people's songs.

742
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,600
And they could use any wide variety of songs.

743
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:13,600
And we could do that right now. And I think that the pod show can, can figure out a way to negotiate something really well that will probably

744
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:23,600
work so well that no one who just wants to play some some cover songs, you know, some great songs, by the way, will have to shell out any money at all.

745
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:31,600
So I'm going to work on that. And just to give you an example of of what I mean, I'm going to play a song, which is a cover version and Brian in, but I know is smiling.

746
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,600
He's from cover, really. Because he has this all figured out and it took me a little while to catch on because

747
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:46,600
just because it's not the original artist that became a hit, you know, on the radio whenever the song still is the most important part.

748
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,600
This is the song that was on the radio when Christina was born. And I was, it was actually a C section. I was in the operating room.

749
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:05,600
And, you know, it's, it's a part of the soundtrack of our life. And it doesn't matter if it's the Beatles singing it or if it's Alison Crow.

750
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,600
And I mean it. The emotion is still the same. So it's not pod safe, but this is here to prove a point.

751
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:38,600
When our places are remember in my life, those some have changed, some forever not for better, some have gone, and some remain, all these places had their moments.

752
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:59,600
With lovers and friends, I still can recall some are dead and some are living. And my life I've loved them all.

753
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:16,600
But all these friends and lovers, there is no one compares with you, and these memories lose their meaning.

754
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:33,600
When I think of love as something you, there are no one ever lose affection for people and things that went to be far.

755
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:48,600
And all often stop and think about them, and my life I love you more.

756
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:29,600
And though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went to be far, I'll know all often stop and think about them.

757
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:36,600
And my life I love you more.

758
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:50,600
And my life I love you more.

759
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Welcome to 101 uses for baby wipes. Here comes the daddy cast.

760
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:14,600
My name is in the obituary column. And in the now it's time for new parents can use.

761
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:21,600
In the headlines today, living near freeways causes asthma. Is it ADHD or sleep deprivation?

762
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:28,600
Riddle in, not method crack, is all a rage on campus.

763
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:36,600
Test your cartoon trivia skills with the tune test.

764
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:51,600
Right, too much a one thing can be boring, so a nice mix of news and entertainment works for me.

765
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,600
Sorry, that was just way too much fun.

766
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:04,600
We're at 101 uses for baby wipes.com, and I tend, and of course, at the pod safe music network.

767
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:11,600
I'll show a dot com, recommend listening with at least one foot firmly planted in reality.

768
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,600
How many times does this happen to you?

769
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,600
I have fifty dollars.

770
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
What game did you get?

771
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
I think I was going to film that up in the end.

772
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:28,600
The new abitually wrong, mister. You see, if you listen to the teen gearing podcasts, they would tell you what games are actually worth purchasing.

773
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:39,600
Okay, that'll do it for the daily source code for today.

774
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:45,600
I am very excited about this idea of getting a license for covers for the pod safe music network.

775
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
I'll be back tomorrow with another source code from the cottage.

776
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,600
So let me do my sign off here.

777
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:00,600
Another pod show podcast. Stick it in your ear.
