1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Get us here, Charlie, two five three.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please save me from people who've been told what to like and then like it.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In my opinion, if you're over six years of age and you're still getting your music from the radio,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
something is desperately wrong with you.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I can only hope that somehow MP3 players and file sharing will destroy FM radio the way they're destroying record companies.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then, even though the air will probably never be safe to breathe again,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
maybe it will be safer to listen to.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There are no secrets.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Only information you don't even have.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Adam Curry.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
With sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then, the next generation radio content in my ears.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It is October 4th in the year of our Lord, 2005.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello, everybody. It is Tuesday.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's the 4th that is 11.15 a.m. here at Curry Cottage.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The affluent Surries Subber.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a beautiful day.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A little bit chilly, but it's that perfect sunshine kind of nippy English weather.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You know what I mean?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a bit nippy outside.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hey, I'm caught up. I'm caught up with my sleep.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I woke up this morning, quarter or seven, ready to go.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
After having caught up with my East Enders episodes last night.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh yeah.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No matter what happens in this country, no matter what technological innovation or governmental change will take place,

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
we will always have East Enders.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I've got to show that it's damn full today.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I actually overloaded the playlist.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's so many promos that since I put out the call,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and that's those lazy ass podcast.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Just to set me some promos, they're not so lazy.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ask anymore.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But it's fantastic.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can really feel everything just growing,

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
growing around us.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Podcasting.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Going place is big.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh man.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, pod safe music.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll be talking about the pod safe music network.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Of course, some feedback on the biodiesel

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the shit just does not stop people peep talking about it.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hit to ask from young palette to number six to three already.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And, uh, so we gotta have some other cool stuff.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We'll, uh, get through it.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Just hang with me.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You'll be fine.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll take you on your way to work.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
On your way home.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And if you're listening to us on channel 103 on serious satellite radio in the morning,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
6 a.m. Good morning.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What are you doing up?

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hey, um, art for mashup town sent me a brand new mashup.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Actually, this was supposed to run yesterday.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's Kaiser Zook.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think that's the way you pronounce it.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
K-H-Y-Z-E-R.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000

I guarantee you that.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Pretend we're bringing the mashup on the daily source code.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000

But it's not fair, it's fair

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But it's not fair, it's not fair

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's fair, it's fair

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Only, only when you're home

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You ain't Got a ride, only when you're home

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You ain't got a ride, only when you're home

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's the one time supposed to be your born baby

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You got freedom by but come acting crazy

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Feminists want out a good time baby

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why you try to pull like I'm the acting chain

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
One time supposed to be your born baby

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Get freedom by but come acting crazy

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Try to pull like I'm giving a good love in it

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Are you trying to pull like I'm the acting chain

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey you love me, say you love me

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But you never step over me, yeah

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Woo woo woo

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:54,000
can be promise only.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There we need some time long

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, க 알ade

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You hear that little skip again?

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,080
Damn, and I'm telling you, man.

112
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,480
I heard actually a pretty good rumor

113
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,600
that Apple, the supply lines for Apple are very, very low

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,800
that never been this low, which often signals

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,480
a new product line coming out.

116
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,200
So the rumor that I read was that in two weeks,

117
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,320
it's gonna be a new line of Max,

118
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,320
possibly like a professional line of Macintosh's.

119
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,680
Oh, man, what I love to buy a new power book.

120
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
You know, I just can't do it, you know,

121
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,320
I can't, I can't, you know,

122
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,440
there's either two ways to go.

123
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,320
I reinstall all the OS and clean up the hard,

124
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,240
and it probably the hard drive is probably

125
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,440
it'll crunchy at this point.

126
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,200
And I probably could have,

127
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
can I actually tell how much memory is in this machine?

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,240
You know what, that's a bad idea.

129
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,480
It's a bad idea, open the system profile

130
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,120
while you're trying to record something, won't do it.

131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,800
But that's the rumor, so hopefully that's true,

132
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,120
because then I will definitely go for a new machine.

133
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
Getting back, getting into the swing of things here,

134
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,360
a small pile of bills, that's not too bad.

135
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,680
You know, that's kind of one of the things

136
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,200
I dread about coming back is, you know,

137
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,720
you're gone for a couple of weeks and you come back.

138
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,400
It's build time again, invariably.

139
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,680
It's always build time, but some other cool things

140
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,080
I got re-invited to the invite actually

141
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,840
came a couple of months ago, Rob over at Eagle 94

142
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,000
in Gilford, it's a great station.

143
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,720
Because, you know, we've discussed this radio really works well

144
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,920
when it's local and they're talking about the local community.

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,920
And Eagle 94, the PG and something show at the morning,

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,440
our very local, I like that.

147
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,120
And that is actually Christina,

148
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,200
we'll sometimes switch to that in the car.

149
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Of course, I'm listening to Radio 4, which is the elite talk station.

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,920
So she's not very interested in listening to that.

151
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,440
So Friday, I'm gonna go over and visit with the guys at the Eagle.

152
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,880
I'll be kind of fun.

153
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,960
Lots of email coming in,

154
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,960
regarding the podcast Patricia and I did on Sunday

155
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,960
where she is a musician as a peer, commented on,

156
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
most of the songs that I played from the Podsafe

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,680
and Music Network in the past week or two.

158
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,520
And it's great because even the songs that she had

159
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,720
suggestions about, I think that just about every single artist

160
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
has email and it said, wow, you know,

161
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
she really has a great ear.

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,760
That was actually a demo that I made and I agree.

163
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,280
I really want to have a better production.

164
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,920
And she's gotten some offers to produce some records.

165
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,320
I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it.

166
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
And there's something else really cool happening

167
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,720
with the Podsafe music network.

168
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,640
Now, Podsho is nothing to do with this next to promo

169
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,080
or with the show, as far as I know.

170
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,400
But I thoroughly supported it.

171
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,160
And I think that we should do some more with this

172
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,960
because this came, I heard this and I was like, oh my God, you know,

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,600
we've already reached, we've already reached this point.

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
What point?

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,560
This point.

176
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,200
Hey, this is Brother Love from New York City.

177
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,600
And just like you, I'm listening to the PMC Top 10 countdown.

178
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,880
The place to hear Top Podsafe tunes being spun by

179
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,320
Podcasters across the world.

180
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,600
Thank you, Podsafe Music Network, love you.

181
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
It's time.

182
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Time for another PMC Top 10 countdown.

183
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,840
With your host, the Seedalk, Chris Daily.

184
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,640
Counted down the Top 10 Podsafe tunes being spun by Podcasters.

185
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,000
And now your host, the Seedalk, Chris Daily.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Hey, this is Chris Daily.

187
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,280
Do you love good music?

188
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,920
Are you tired of the garbage that's being spun

189
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,760
on terrestrial radio?

190
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,400
We'll check out the PMC Top 10 countdown.

191
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Join me as we count down the Top Podsafe tunes each week,

192
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,640
but don't just take my word for it.

193
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,080
Here's what some of my friends have to say.

194
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,240
This is a dream of Thorpe.

195
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,120
Keep listening to the PMC Top 10.

196
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,800
Hey, everybody.

197
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,840
This is Rob Kosslo and your listening to the PMC Top 10 countdown.

198
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,680
Hello, everybody.

199
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,080
This is Joe from The Bomb Huppies.

200
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,400
You are listening to PMC Top 10.

201
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,040
Podsafe Music Rocks.

202
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,240
Podsho, content that will make you squeeze the dog

203
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,960
and burp your mother.

204
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,080
Hi, this is Craig from The Bits of Silicon Hell podcast.

205
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,440
This is Dude Matt coming at your respect.

206
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm not scared to tell all the people

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,640
that come and download our show from iTunes, the website,

208
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,280
bits of Silicon Hell.com, and everything.

209
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,480
What can we expect to hear when we download it?

210
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,280
You never really know.

211
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
You might hear anything.

212
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,600
For Tevo to Unix to pretty much anything.

213
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,240
Pretty much anything to do with technology.

214
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,920
And it can go over the directions as well.

215
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,280
And it really just a bunch of friends who work or have worked

216
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,520
in the technology and support field.

217
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,080
And we like to sit around and talk about the stuff we're working on,

218
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,960
what's cool, what's coming up.

219
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,640
And sometimes we have stories from the past, things that we've had to do.

220
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,240
So check us out, go to www.bits of Silicon Hell.com.

221
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,520

222
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,440
in iTunes, New York store, under podcasts.

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,640
Just subscribe, and we'll be here until you do.

224
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,040
Adam Curry.

225
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,000
Hi, I'm PW Frantan, creator of the Ponsho Knitworks Digital Flatsom.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,840
And before I listen to the Dawn and Drew Show,

227
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,720
I had never heard of a corn hole.

228
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,040
Listen to Dawn and Drew every day,

229
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,960
either on their podcast at dawnandrew.com

230
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,160
or their show every evening on Syria satellite 103.

231
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,640
Like me, you might learn something.

232
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,080
PW, you kissed your wife, Ross, with that mouth, man.

234
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,240
Yeah.

235
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,080
That's right.

236
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,920
If you're listening to us on Syria,

237
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,120
it's everything that we now podcast on the

238
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,120
podshow podcast network is a simulcast.

239
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,320
Well, not everything, but a lot of it.

240
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,160
We're getting started.

241
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
I got to get a whole damn channel from those guys.

242
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,640
We know, so we got to prove ourselves first.

243
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,000
We'll do it.

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,640
So the first start is there.

245
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,560
We normally are on 6 p.m. Eastern time, 3 p.m. Pacific.

246
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,760
That's when we start with our four hour block of time.

247
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,800
Got madged and her friends, Dawn and Drew and their friends.

248
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,560
Steve Gilmore and his friends.

249
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,440
C.C. Chapman and his friends, P. Dubb and his friends.

250
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,000
So it's pretty horizontally programmed.

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,800
But what they do now is they repeat it in the morning,

252
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,400
starting at 6 in the morning.

253
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,280
So that's the first start, right?

254
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,440
Why don't they just give me four more hours?

255
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,000
No problem.

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
We can fill it.

257
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,680
It really works.

258
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,400
What was I going to say?

259
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,120
Oh, yeah, so that promo by P. Dubb.

260
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,600
He actually sent in a request, you know,

261
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
who's been getting requests for cutting liners and promos

262
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,400
and sweepers and jingles and stuff like that,

263
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,040
is Christina ever since we used Ron the podfinder podcast

264
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,680
as the kind of like the imaging voice.

265
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,680
People are really, really into her, into her stuff.

266
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
And it was great because, you know,

267
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,720
I told you, she did that audition yesterday.

268
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,840
She was a disning auditioning for the part

269
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,200
of Lizzie Borden in a play about Lizzie Borden at school.

270
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,000
And there were two other candidates.

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,720
And she had to be there early at 8 o'clock to do the audition.

272
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,840
And she didn't get the part.

273
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,920
She got the part of like narrator, which, of course,

274
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,000
makes sense because she does have a great speaking voice.

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,760
So she was pretty bummed out.

276
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,520
But then when I was able to say last night,

277
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,600
hey, you know what, there's like two or three requests

278
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,160
for people want you to do some stuff.

279
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,600
And they'll actually pay you for it.

280
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,400
And she really was riding high.

281
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,400
And it's so typical, it's so typical that you can have success

282
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,720
doing something that in school, they'll say,

283
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,840
you're no good at, because doing this stuff really is,

284
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,640
it's also acting, it's performing, it's performing.

285
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,720
She likes doing that, so I'm very, very proud of her.

286
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,960
Oh, man, let's move on.

287
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,000
I've moved some stuff around, because I felt maybe today,

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,440
we'd break the show kind of in half and bring you young polette's stuff.

289
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,200
Oh, I'm proud of you, casting with Adam Curry.

290
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,920
I suppose you think you know me.

291
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,520
I do know my music.

292
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,880
Oh, yeah, just, okay.

294
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,760
Young polette with young polette.

295
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
Hey, Adam, this is Huttest number 63.

296
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,360
Rocking, man.

297
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
And again, I have selected three songs from the 80s.

298
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,840
Okay.

299
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,240
And hopefully your recording problems are gone and over.

300
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,520
So nothing will be skipped from this hit test.

301
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,800
Young really fucking hates it when the stuff skips during the hit test.

302
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,320
So let's all be real careful and hope that nothing skips.

303
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
So three intros and three answers, and this is number one.

304
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,200
Oh, wait, you're solving my test.

305
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,960
Well, that would be a J-Giles band that's centerfold.

306
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,480
Come on.

307
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,040
Number two.

308
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Oh, she's too...

309
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,400
Ready for the world, Oshila?

310
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,240
Do, do, do, do.

311
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,640
Is it Oshila?

312
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,440
You're allowed for me?

313
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
No, no, no.

314
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,400
Oh, thanks.

315
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,200
You.

316
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,840
Baby, I owe you.

317
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,080
I don't know who sings it.

318
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
Is it yours, maybe?

319
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,240
Something like that.

320
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,040
I think I got a ball.

321
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,640
And this is Huttest number one and hit test number 63.

322
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,840
Did J-Giles band has number one?

323
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,200
This is centerfold.

324
00:16:44,480 --> 00:17:06,160
The song from 1982 to J-Giles band.

325
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,560
And this is Huttest number two.

326
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,080
Full force, full force.

327
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,280
I want you just for me.

328
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,320
Shit, okay.

329
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,320
Dallas, Shila.

330
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,920
Whatever the beyond just name was.

331
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,480
Full force get ready one time.

332
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,680
And when you're all alone, I'll send you the moment you're about the world.

333
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,400
Can't you see?

334
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,040
I want you just for me.

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,960
Damn, one hit wonders, but pretty good.

336
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,920
Can't you see?

337
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
I want you just for me.

338
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,000
Full force, sorry.

339
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,680
From 1986, full force.

340
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
And this is Huttest number three.

341
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,320
Freeze, and I owe you.

342
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Yeah, yeah, it's freeze.

343
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
I guess I kind of sucked it there.

344
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:45,280
I'm from 1983.

345
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,920
Freeze and I owe you as answer number three in today's hit test.

346
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,120
Well, that's it.

347
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,600
I hope you did well, Adam.

348
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,880
I hope you enjoyed this one again.

349
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,400
Of course.

350
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
I really love the music from the 80s.

351
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,000
So hopefully, there's enough to feel a lot of hit tests to come.

352
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,960

Yonpolet.

363
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,560
All right, I didn't do that good actually.

364
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,920
I recognize them all at least.

365
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,280
And please do yon's links if you want to purchase something.

366
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,840
One of the tracks that you heard from the iTunes music store.

367
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,920
The show notes for the daily source code, which you can find through daily source code.com,

368
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,880
or from www.curry.com.

369
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,640
Working great these wiki notes.

370
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,920
And I saw, and also received an email when I was actually

371
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,560
read it on the plane, on my way back, that the guy who said this wiki

372
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,160
up, and there were a couple of wiki's that were set up at the same time.

373
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,920
This guy Michael, it's a really horrible story.

374
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,960
He lost his job.

375
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,800
And I guess around the same time, I don't know if it was before,

376
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,840
he started doing the wiki show notes or during or whatever.

377
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,920
And so we actually put up a tip jar.

378
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,240
So I guess I'm going to hire him.

379
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,760
I'm going to have him do these show notes.

380
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
Because I'm not quite sure how it works.

381
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,080
I guess I have to look at the history of the wiki, but something's working.

382
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,840
Because he basically, I guess he starts out and he puts the run down in.

383
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,280
And then people just start adding stuff.

384
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,880
And I really, really appreciate it.

385
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,320
It's really made these show notes a lot richer than they were.

386
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,040
And although I do miss having them along in the RSS feed, it's, man, it really does.

387
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,840
This works.

388
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,800
It really does work.

389
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
Here's a thought.

390
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,040
Well, I got to think.

391
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,760
I got to think about when it comes to these wiki show notes.

392
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
I really see the benefit.

393
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,880
I see some of the drawbacks, but we're getting close to something good.

394
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,160
So Michael, I'm going to send you an email.

395
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm going to take care of you.

396
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,760
And everyone thanks who put up wiki's and got stuff going.

397
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,520
And even though we had one wiki that was up, it looked really good.

398
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,640
And then it fell down and it fell down for a long time.

399
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,880
Then people kind of migrated over to the alternative link.

400
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
And Michael's just doing a great job.

401
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,160
And everyone who's adding stuff into the wiki show notes is doing a great job.

402
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
Really, really appreciated.

403
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,200
I guess we're now into the vehicular part of the part of the show.

404
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,000
Hannah, I'm just a Mark Pika from the Travel Commons podcast.

405
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,920
I was catching up on some of your daily source codes last week.

406
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,360
Last week, I'm Friday.

407
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,520
And her dimension, your observation that the American card design is getting better.

408
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,600
And Friday I was in Detroit, actually in Warren, Michigan, driving down Van Dyke road,

409
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,120
right by the GM Tech Center where a lot of that design happens.

410
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,680
And then anything about driving around in those areas of Detroit is that you see all the brain

411
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,960
new cars, either the one either they've just been released or they haven't even been released

412
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
there's sort of pre-production cars.

413
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,080
So I must have seen at least three or four the new Pontiac solstices, guys running around

414
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,360
in that two-seater, two-seat roaster with the top down because it was a nice day for adding Detroit.

415
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,480
And that's a sharp-looking car, saw a bunch of the new Chevy HHRs, which is sort of,

416
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,560
it looks a little bit like a PT cruiser, but it's really the design cues or a take-off of the

417
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,760
1940s suburban, but a lot smaller.

418
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,560
And that's a neat, you know, neat looking car.

419
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,040
And saw a sub-brain new mercury kind of their mid-size one hadn't seen one of those out around.

420
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,520
And then you always see a couple of the cars that are actually truly pre-production still haven't

421
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,080
been announced, so they've got the big black bras on the front and the back, so they're driving

422
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,040
them around, but you can't tell what they look like because the front and the back are hidden.

423
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,640
So that's always been a neat thing about living in the Detroit area.

424
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,880
And if you think about it, you don't get that out on the west coast out in Torrance,

425
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
California, where the big three Japanese are located because they really don't have design

426
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,760
capabilities out in California, all the Japanese cars are creating cars or designed over

427
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,760
and Asia, but in Detroit you get to see where they've got the engineering and design,

428
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,440
you get to see the brand new stuff before comes out.

429
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,200
And that's, I don't know, it's a neat thing.

430
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,240
And I would agree with you that that American cars have come a long way,

431
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,960
and there's some really neat styling, you look at the Chrysler 300C, I don't think anything

432
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,160
touches it. And I think this next way of stuff coming out of coming out of GM, especially the

433
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,800
Solstice in the Saturn Sky, which, you know, it's interesting. I was watching top gear the other day,

434
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,680
which is the big British once a week, BBC Auto Show, which is very well produced and hosted

435
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,880
and the whole format of the show is just really, really interesting, even Patricia will watch that show.

436
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,640
And they slammed the 300C, I think it was a best of actually, but they completely slammed it.

437
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,320
And I was actually pretty interested in it. Does it come in diesel version?

438
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,920
I, which is going to be Saturn's, his buddy of mine tells me much,

439
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,640
edgeier cut at the solstice, some neat stuff. So, I just some thoughts on that take care,

440
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,160
and talk to you soon by now.

441
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,440
Well, okay, well, that's funny. There was still said there was like two minutes left on that.

442
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,160
Okay. Good. Go on. No problem. Let me just forward that.

443
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,560
Yeah, that's cool, man. Thank you very much for the report. We need pictures to go with that, actually.

444
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,360
That would be cool. If you see something like that, take some pictures. Those pictures actually.

445
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,360
I think they sell. Don't automaggings buy those. All the time. There comes iTunes again.

446
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,640
You can quit iTunes in million times and it keeps coming back, like,

447
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,320
fucking bad Mexican lunch, man.

448
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,320
And I've turned off all of my widgets and my dashboard and it's still coming back.

449
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,720
Some more thoughts on biodiesel now from one of our listeners.

450
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,800
Hey Adam, this is Mike in Kansas City.

451
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,040
Been listening to the daily source code of late and I've had a couple of points on biodiesel.

452
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,720
This is something I've been looking into for a while myself and I've read a few reports,

453
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,120
and I could probably do the research and look at all of them.

454
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,160
Although I'm sure many people have already emailed you about it before,

455
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,160
but something that doesn't make sense about biodiesel at this point in time

456
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,240
is that it's a negative energy source. In other words, it takes more energy to produce it

457
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
and grow it than you actually get from burning it.

458
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,440
So unless there are some scientific breakthroughs in the near future with the production and use of biodiesel,

459
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,680
it actually does not make any sense at all as far as a replacement for petrodiesel.

460
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,280
And secondly, on the topic of taxing biodiesel, the reason for this is that at least here in the United

461
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,360
States, fuel taxes go to the construction and maintenance of roads.

462
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,400
So this is why folks who make their own fuel need to pay this tax because they use the public roads

463
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,320
and this is funded out of the fuel tax, which makes sense because most people in order to use the

464
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,320
roads have to buy fuel. This is why also farmers are able to buy diesel, at least in this

465
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,000
party of the United States. They're able to buy diesel with almost next to no fuel tax at all,

466
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,840
and it's also why if they're caught using farm diesel on public roads, it gets some pretty stiff

467
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,760
fines because this fuel is meant to be used out in the fields where they're not putting anywhere

468
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,120
and tear on the roads. That's all I've got to add for now. Thanks for the music and the entertainment

469
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,960
and the thought provoking topics raised on the Delta CR Charlie. Keep it the great work.

470
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,760
Yeah, dude, thank you very much. Yeah, I agree with that. I think, of course, you got to pay

471
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,440
tax for keeping the roads running. That's no problem. So I just don't know what the mechanism is for

472
00:26:49,520 --> 00:27:04,160
that. And regarding more energy, more energy to create biodiesel fuel than it, than it

473
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,400
results in, I don't know, man. You're the first one actually that has said that. So I'm sure that

474
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,120
you're that you've done the research, but I just don't see it. Can't you just use corn oil to make

475
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,000
more corn oil? I mean, I know, why do you need heat? Do you need heat to make corn oil? Do you

476
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,720
need heat to make hemp oil? I'd love to know more about that for sure. I don't know why don't

477
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,120
rush a hit. I heard you talking about running your car on vegetables. Just as you know,

478
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,480
the small vegetables that I want to be able to use up before the go up. There's a bin back sitting

479
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,800
outside my house. I just want to come and take them up to make some moonshine petrol with

480
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,120
worth advice. I'm on a special date at the moment, and I personally have been running on

481
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,160
vegetables for the last four weeks. A little on vegetables, but tend to, because rather

482
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,760
a bad smell, I've been shouldn't have paid off the walls for the last couple of weeks. It's been

483
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,800
pretty bad. So if you plan on running the car, then I've been prepared for a little bit of the

484
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,040
exhaust to smell a little bit. You don't want to be known as that low to try to surround

485
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,000
guilt, but in a line show that smells about five. And you certainly don't want to say it to

486
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,480
be associated with those old fasts and tools, especially at your time in life. Anyway,

487
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,440
let me know if you want to take care of that bag of cabbages up to that south side. And

488
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,800
keep that for good work with America and podcasting. Yeah. Thank you very much, Rodger. I'll be

489
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,280
sure to pick up that cabbages and stick it in my tank. Meanwhile, you might want to stick this

490
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,320
one in your ear. It's amazing what you'll find if you just drop in with a pot-safe music network.

491
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,880
Went in and checked out the recent plays, recent spins, and I eventually got through to,

492
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,000
found that CC Chapman had played this on a show just last night, even though I hadn't

493
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,640
heard the show, it was very apparent through the network. And it freaked me out when I saw the

494
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,520
name. It's PW Fenton and the second ward. That's right, I've very own PW. On guitar and lead vocals

495
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,960
with silence, treatment. Whatever I've done this time, I know it must have been back here.

496
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,160
Whatever I've done this time, I know it must have been back.

497
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,960
When you can see that silent treatment, I know you're really mad.

498
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,160
I've given that silent treatment, and I don't know what I've done wrong.

499
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm giving that silent treatment, and I don't know what I've done wrong.

500
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:54,800
When you can see that cold show, maybe. I cannot check for what I've been here long.

501
00:30:44,160 --> 00:31:03,280
I'm giving that silent treatment, and I don't know what I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong.

502
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:15,920
I'm giving that silent treatment, and I don't know what I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong.

503
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:22,560
What I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong.

504
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,200
Stop giving me that silent treatment, and it's what I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong.

505
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,840
What I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong.

506
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:56,320
What I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong, and I don't know what I've done wrong.

507
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,400
So frustrating, I'm gonna cry.

508
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,840
Poo, Pidoob.

509
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,000
And the second award.

510
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,440
With that silent treatment, Pidoob, man, all right,

511
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,600
I dig that.

512
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,680
And that's from his now defunct band, I guess.

513
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
That was from 1997.

514
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,920
And only now listed on the podcast music,

515
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,840
now we're gonna tell you this guy's slow.

516
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,960
Awesome, man.

517
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,880
Okay, Pidoob, get your band back together

518
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,480
and do a, do like a song for the show.

519
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,280
Do a song for the, oops.

520
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,520
Oh, my, CD drive, just open.

521
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,040
Do a song for the daily source code.

522
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,320
That would, that would love that.

523
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,080
I would be eternally grateful for that.

524
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,920
Very, very cool.

525
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,120
He's uploaded like four songs,

526
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,160
so the four, five songs to the podcast music network.

527
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Check it out, music.podshow.com.

528
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,600
So home now for two weeks time,

529
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,320
going back around the 16th or 17th.

530
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,720
I think that what we're gonna do is,

531
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
I'm gonna go back the 16th,

532
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,640
stay for like an eight or nine days,

533
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,120
then fly back.

534
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,160
Then we're gonna go for a quick vacation

535
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
because Christina has half-term.

536
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,960
So she has like a full school week.

537
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
So what is that?

538
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,880
Nine days of vacation.

539
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,160
So I think the what we'll do is we'll go visit some friends

540
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,040
and Portugal for a couple of days.

541
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,000
And then we'll come back and then I'll go back.

542
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,960
That's San Francisco.

543
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,840
Because this is really a crucial time.

544
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,480
We are, you know, we've really been doing a lot of work

545
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,200
on two areas.

546
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,040
One is for listeners.

547
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,400
How do we make sure that we get our 100 million listener

548
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,000
March completed?

549
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,800
We're already moving.

550
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,880
I think we're probably, in listenership,

551
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,840
based upon studies and intuition and our own numbers.

552
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I think we're probably around about 10 million people

553
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,560
listening to podcasts now globally.

554
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,520
That's probably about right.

555
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,120
We've at least listened to a podcast

556
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,640
and are subscribed to a podcast.

557
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,560
Or worse, who have clicked on a link

558
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,040
and listened to a podcast,

559
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,040
but you know, don't have the whole automatic part down yet

560
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,880
that there's not using it.

561
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,520
So we're, that's gonna be pretty cool.

562
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,760
When we launch that, that'll basically be podshow.com.

563
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,840
So what you see now, of course,

564
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,560
is intentionally left lame to throw you off the track.

565
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,000
But what we'll come out with first

566
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,240
and this is really pertinent right now.

567
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,160
Yahoo, I guess, is a starting to point to podcasts,

568
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,400
which is great.

569
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,800
Oh, man, do I love that?

570
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,800
More distribution, more exposure, more listeners, fantastic.

571
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,240
The downside and this is now just kind of rippling

572
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,280
through podcaster land.

573
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,400
The downside is that if you get a link,

574
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,120
we don't really know what it means yet.

575
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,200
If you get a link from Yahoo, what happens?

576
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,240
How much bandwidth is that gonna cost you?

577
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,200
Does it mean that a million people show up at your door?

578
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,520
We just don't know yet.

579
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,920
We're following this closely, of course.

580
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,680
Now, this is something,

581
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,520
although it won't have the same impact as iTunes.

582
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,920
It's definitely gonna have some impact.

583
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,920
So we are now, what is the word?

584
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,760
Accelerating our development of the podshow PDF,

585
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,640
which is the podcast delivery network.

586
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,640
And the idea here is that anyone can host their show

587
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,640
for free on the PDF.

588
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,280
And we've discussed this before.

589
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,680
So you get unlimited bandwidth.

590
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
And when I say unlimited,

591
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,920
I mean really unlimited, unlimited bandwidth.

592
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,320
So, you know, and we hope you become enormously successful

593
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,120
because, of course, you'll have different ways

594
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,080
to work with the system.

595
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,480
You can pay for features.

596
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,000
You can exchange those for an ad that will be attached

597
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,720
to your podcast.

598
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,880
You could not have that and just pay for it if you want to.

599
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,840
But you get it for free.

600
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,640
And look, if you get a whole bunch of listeners

601
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,800
and you're interested, we'll help you monetize it.

602
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,640
So, this is not really announcement,

603
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,800
but it's coming very, very soon.

604
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,320
So, those of you who are worried about bandwidth

605
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
that we are coming with some solutions,

606
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,960
that I think will really, really blow you away

607
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,200
if you've been thinking about podcasting,

608
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,200
or if you're, I'd say pretty much if you're doing one already.

609
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,760
That's the one thing that we've got great interfaces.

610
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,120
We've got all kinds of tools to use,

611
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,200
but we really just, you know, it costs money.

612
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,520
That's at the end of the day,

613
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,440
if you wanna go and buy bandwidth and sure,

614
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,040
you can get a really good deal on 15 gigs a month,

615
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,360
or maybe 30 gigs a month of transfer,

616
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,280
but if you need to go buy it, you're gonna pay anywhere

617
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,280
from, I'd say, 70 cents to a buck 25 per gigabyte transferred.

618
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,160
And that's real dough.

619
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,520
So, you gotta be able, if you have that,

620
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,360
that's fine.

621
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,200
If you don't, then there's, you gotta figure something out.

622
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,600
So, we're gonna come up with that very, very soon.

623
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,680
What else do we talk about recently?

624
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,160
About the Arbitron ratings,

625
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,600
the radio measurements got some feedback about that

626
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,600
from Brian Kiran's, Kiran's, Kiran's.

627
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,440
Hi, I'm Brian Kiran's from Kiran's.

628
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,800
I was undirect podcast, I was singing to you.

629
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,920
Daily source code for Monday,

630
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,280
and I was just wanna give you some feedback

631
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,760
on the radio rating systems.

632
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,840
I did a similar ratings review,

633
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,880
or Nielsen's type thing for the Canadian radio system,

634
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,120
and the television system at different points.

635
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,960
And it was basically the same, you get a little flip book,

636
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,360
and you write down the times that you listen

637
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,360
to a particular station, so say I started at 815

638
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,320
on Monday morning, I'd write down this station,

639
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,400
and then I'd remark a little arrow down

640
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,120
to then when I finished listening to it.

641
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,040
So 815-845, it would be the time I'd listen to it,

642
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,640
and then I'd do that for each day,

643
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,280
or every time I listened to the radio,

644
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,360
we didn't have anything else for any other kind of media,

645
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,360
because in the late 90s, there wasn't any TV on the internet,

646
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,400
or radio on the internet, like we have podcasting now.

647
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,280
So I just wanted to give you that little tidbit of information,

648
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,520
it seemed to be the same for a U.S. or Canada,

649
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,600
anywhere else where they do rating systems.

650
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,760
So take care of them, keep going with the daily source code, I love it.

651
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,000
Right, very scientific, there you go,

652
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,840
that's how they measure it, very scientific,

653
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,320
please write it down, please take notes

654
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,760
and write it down and hand it into us.

655
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,440
Yeah, that used to work in school too.

656
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
Haven't talked about sound seeing in a while,

657
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,200
sound seeing tours.com, sound seeing tours.com,

658
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,400
where there's a great collection of sound seeing tours, obviously,

659
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,240
and the audio collective is done with as well

660
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,720
from an elephant.

661
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,560
Hey, I'm this is Dave from the audio collective,

662
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,440
and I'm coming to you with 800 pounds of elephant,

663
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,240
strapped to my butt.

664
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,080
That's right, it's Dave from audio collective.net,

665
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,960
and we do sound seeing tours and a whole bunch of different kinds

666
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,480
of podcasts and, you know, just cool stuff like that.

667
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,520
And we're big fans of the daily source code

668
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,080
and you show on serious, keep up the sweet stuff.

669
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,000
And if you want to check out our show,

670
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,240
that'd be cool too, audio collective.net.

671
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,760
We do a podcast about once a week,

672
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,760
and it's me, my wife Rachel and our friend Corey,

673
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,440
and he Corey is kind of out there sometimes,

674
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,760
but hey, I guess I'm right in an elephant right now,

675
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,040
so what can I say?

676
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,360
So come in to you live in the top of an elephant,

677
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,440
when I live a podcast and straight from off

678
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,560
to the elephant right here, talk to you later.

679
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,080
I'll show a dot com, recommend listening with

680
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,880
at least one foot firmly planted in reality.

681
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,080
Hey, Adam, this is Ray Anthony, former corporate radio guy,

682
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,200
and hey, Ray Anthony, yeah, what are you doing?

683
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,880
Well, Gary Coleman, I'm striking out on my own this time

684
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,720
with a new podcast at radioguide.com.

685
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,440
It's kind of like a radio show with entertainment news

686
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,840
and current events, but this time I don't have to worry

687
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,520
about my boss yelling at me calling on my hotline,

688
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,720
so I can say what I want.

689
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,880
What you talking about, Ray Anthony?

690
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,120
Well, that means that we dive a little bit in the politics

691
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,880
and some taboo subjects like touchy conspiracy theory.

692
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,720
Who's today?

693
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,600
You leave her out at the radioguide.com.

694
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,120
Yeah, radioguide.

695
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,960
That's really true.

696
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,480
That's really the big difference.

697
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,880
And we welcome anybody who's from traditional radio

698
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,800
and wants to get podcasting a shot.

699
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,920
It's so liberating.

700
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,360
Because what really is, when you're on a live broadcast,

701
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,800
whether it's on radio or television,

702
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,760
it's really easy if you're not on a live broadcast

703
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,240
because you can always, what we call burn tape,

704
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,040
although it's not really tape anymore.

705
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,640
And they'll just roll it back and hit play and record

706
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,680
at the same time over again.

707
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,840
At least that's what we did at MTV.

708
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,080
But I think the burn tape concept,

709
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,720
everyone in television is familiar with it and radio.

710
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,120
So I mean, you burn the tape.

711
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,560
And but when you're on live, television or radio,

712
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,840
you're constantly everything you say,

713
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,920
go through this little filter in the back of your mind.

714
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,640
And this little filter looks for little nuggets

715
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,320
in your stream of consciousness.

716
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,880
Before it hits your, the part that forms the words

717
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,120
in your brain and then spits it out through your mouth.

718
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,960
It's looking for bad words.

719
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,200
Words we can't say or, and this is,

720
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,040
and that's one thing.

721
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,200
Because you know, you can basically pre-program yourself.

722
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,920
You know, that's done since childhood.

723
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
You're not supposed to say a number of words.

724
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,160
And so that's pretty much, that's where your filters

725
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,000
originate.

726
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,840
Everyone has the filters.

727
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,920
But then you have to add to that corporate policy,

728
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,320
political stuff on MTV.

729
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,600
That was even though we were, oh man,

730
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,800
we have so many outtakes that were so funny.

731
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,720
But you could never talk bad about the artist

732
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,880
or anything even close to that.

733
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,720
So it becomes very tiresome

734
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,160
because you're always running your entire stream,

735
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,400
thoughts stream, you're running it through this filter.

736
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,640
And that filter is almost entirely removed.

737
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,000
Oh, actually completely removed when you're doing podcasting.

738
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,840
Or when you're doing, when you're podcasting.

739
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,320
And it's, you'll like it.

740
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,240
You'll really, I'll check it out radioguide.com.

741
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,040
We'll make sure I check it out.

742
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,360
Let's do one more from the Pod Safe Music Network.

743
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,720
If you don't mind, this is song that'll actually

744
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,920
couple of people pointed me to this.

745
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,840
Uh, actually, this guy's guys going to own record company

746
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,800
going and kind of an 80's revival type sound.

747
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,280
Skycar, this is Alicia.

748
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,720
You're one of a kind of perfect fit to my body and mind.

749
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,560
Just like a dream come true and dance through my life.

750
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,560
Just like you do, I wish every night, you're here to hold me tight.

751
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:52,200
You are what I seek, my little angel with a deadly strength.

752
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,960
Oh, Alicia, I won't turn around and walk away.

753
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,440
Oh, Alicia, I will stay forever and a day.

754
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,320
Oh, Alicia, would you feel safe and sound?

755
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Oh, Alicia, liberators love I ever found.

756
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,920
Oh, now I won't put it down.

757
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,240
I won't let it down.

758
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,760
Pain of future, right in the time, be at a side.

759
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,040
Oh, you are one of a kind to every kiss.

760
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,680
Just close my mind.

761
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,880
You make me feel that it is upcoming baby.

762
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,280
These repeats, you're touching so profound.

763
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,560
Never lose.

764
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,680
My name is Alicia.

765
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,000
My name is Alicia.

766
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,880
I will stay forever and a day.

767
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,280
You are what I seek, my little angel with a deadly strength.

768
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,640
And you are what I seek, my little angel with a deadly strength.

769
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,500
But you're so profound, never lost, suddenly found

770
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,860
Come on baby, look my way, move on close here and stay

771
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,620
Oh, I need shot, I won't turn around, I walk away

772
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,080
Oh, I need shot, I won't stay forever and if they

773
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,080
Oh, I need shot, would you be what I feel, say the sound

774
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,360
Oh, I need shot, look right at the slow, I have a phone

775
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,360
Oh, I won't put it down, I won't let it down

776
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,360
Pain of future, right at the time

777
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Be at a side, I won't put it down, I won't let it down

778
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:33,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

779
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

780
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

781
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Oh, I need shot, I won't turn around, I walk away

782
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:51,360
Oh, I need shot, I won't stay forever and if they

783
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,360
Oh, I need shot, would you be what I feel, say the sound

784
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Oh, I need shot, look right at the slow, I have a phone

785
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,360
Oh, I won't put it down, I won't let it down

786
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

787
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,360
Oh, I won't put it down, I won't let it down

788
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

791
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

794
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

795
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

799
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

806
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
Pain of future, right at the time

807
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

808
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

809
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,360
Pain of future, right at the time

810
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

811
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

812
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

813
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

814
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

815
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

816
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

817
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Pain of future, right at the time, be at a side

818
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,160
It could all run through kind of like one clearing house because one thing I know for sure

819
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,080
the the amount of work you have to do to log and track and

820
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,080
Oh man to make sure you know just we should have some kind of blanket license that we can that we can use now

821
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,160
Of course we still have to do better on reporting back

822
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,360
But so far I think we're like 90% or 95% of

823
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,920
Podcasts who are using these from the podcast music network. I'm reporting it back into the network and

824
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,480
So that's you know we're doing it now just for

825
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,920
Just for the love and for giving back to the artists, but

826
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,960
When we and I'm presuming that we will cut some kind of deal when we cut a deal

827
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,400
You know these other artists within the pod safe music network can also take advantage

828
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,040
I would at least be the way I want to

829
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,080
Stuggling with the bar still here. That's the way I want to put the deal together is

830
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,880
That they would automatically become a member of either a scap or be a mile

831
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,520
I wonder if you can be a member of both if that makes any sense probably not

832
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,840
So I think we can come up with a real win win situation here. You know come up with

833
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,560
Something that really cost the podcaster nothing unless money's being made on the show

834
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,120
Right and

835
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,120
We'd act as the clearinghouse and then as a bonus benefit

836
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,520
We'd sign up

837
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,440
You know we'd have some kind of I'd love it to be an almost an automatic type of

838
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,320
Pod safe

839
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,880
We call it pod safe membership to the to these collection it because that's what we agree right there collection agencies

840
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760
So that way

841
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,320
Even if your song is played as a pod safe music tune

842
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,320
You'll also get compensated if money was made through the use of that

843
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:08,520
I think we should still keep the the fair use out front and center because that's really really important

844
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,680
That if you just want to put a show together that it you know you can just use some pod safe music and

845
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,080
That it won't cost anything

846
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,440
So

847
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,560
That's that that is happening this week and uh and also very just just a little side note

848
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,280
That you know remember when they added a Alaska and Hawaii to the United States

849
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,280
I don't remember personally, but

850
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,960
It wasn't all that long ago

851
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,760
Something similar is happening over in Europe. They're adding Turkey

852
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,800
I guess now that the talks can be officially on and Turkey can officially

853
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,360
Applied to come into the European unions can be there and just to see what happens there

854
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,360
All right, everybody that's it for me

855
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,560
DailySourceco.com is where you can find all the info about the show. I'll be back tomorrow for the hump day edition take care
