1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Daily source code 1-24-25.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Transmators, we don't need no stinkin' transmitters.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There are wums as a fellow in curry, who's do need high cause and to worry.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Technicians installed 6 maga bit balls, that we get some stuff off in our hurry.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:42,700
Yeah!

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Adam Carey, thank you for your time.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,760
No, no, it's Gilford. My name's Adam Curry for the next 40 minutes. New podcast and pot save tunes.

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,200
Or as Dr. Floyd would say, it's fun making a show about nothing.

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,440
Man, normally I have a show full of all kinds of stuff because I did saving it up over the weekend.

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,360
Yesterday, of course, we did a special make make do or make up or make good podcast.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,720
So I thought that I wouldn't have that much to share with you today until I check my Gmail account.

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
This is the MP3 feedback at gmail.com, man.

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,720
Clentio. Clentio MP3 is coming in there. Lots to look at.

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:48,000
Actually, a very calm weekend. This is my first full weekend that I had the fat pipe or at least the

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,080
interim fat pipes. Still no word from easy net. I don't think that the four megabit

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,960
despite what you heard in the opening there. It's not sex makes six megabit, but four megabit pipe.

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,560
I don't think it's connected yet. I'll have to check the router later on.

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,200
Or as they say here, the UK, the Ruta. It's not a router. It's a Ruta, everyone.

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
It's a Ruta!

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:20,000
So, I said yesterday, almost the entire week is clear on the calendar, which means plenty of time for

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,160
well, particularly downloading podcasts, checking out new stuff, maybe I've actually thought about

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,600
hacking a little bit of code, doing some creating some stuff that hasn't actually, I haven't been

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
able to find out there. We'll talk about that in a second.

24
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,440
Something that I found last night was, actually, I was really, really happy. Remember that

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,680
the lascivious bitties were on coverville, and they did a Brian from coverville,

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,960
an interview with the bitties. They were New York, he was up in Canada, and the interview was done

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,240
by IChat AV on Macs, and it was really a shame because the quality was just so fucking poor.

28
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,480
And this was, you know, actually, insert Skype, Skype mentioned here. Hello Skype, can you make

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,720
recording easier, please? Can you make it easier? Will use your stuff? I swear to God.

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,680
So, now there's a director's cut available, which in the DVD world means something a little

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,120
bit different than in the podcast world. In this case, what happened is Ben from the bitties,

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,000
Ben is not a bitty, or maybe he's the fifth bitty. He's their production manager, and I

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,440
does a lot of stuff for the bitties. He also set up the whole interview on their end of the conversation.

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,960
I guess he sent a recording of what they did in New York over to Brian, and he cut everything together.

35
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,720
And now it's really an excellent, excellent interview, which I encourage you to check out.

36
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,480
It's the director's cut of the cover real podcast with the lasivias bitties. You can find it

37
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,640
at uh, I guess cover real dot com. That's where uh, that's where I always find it. And then, of course,

38
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,920
you can subscribe to the podcast there. If you're looking for other podcasts, by the way,

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,720
we have a great categorized listing. It's a directory. It's called ipodder.org,

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,600
and you can find most of the topics there, and podcasts associated with it. This is also the

41
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,640
directory, by the way, that that flows through most of the ipodder software. We're having a

42
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,120
product problem with ipodder lemon. And this is a really complicated one. It goes a little bit

43
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,000
while it goes way above my head, really. It seems that in technology, we've been able to agree on

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,800
a whole bunch of things, except how we encode dates. I think is one. Although there's multiple agreements,

45
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,800
but the hardest part is character encoding. If you've ever seen this uh, you know, ietf-8

46
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,640
whatever encoding crap, that basically is, it's been explained to me. But I guess what your software

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:57,040
needs to be if it's creating um, uh, files that work all over the world that has to be double bite

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,360
encoded, which essentially means you have to have, you know, double the amount of code is what

49
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,360
sounds like to me. What's going to explain to me. Um, so what happens is if someone adds a

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,240
um, a podcast with a name that has special characters like one of the French podcast or Portuguese

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,040
podcast that are also listed in the directory and the languages, um, it can basically break a

52
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,160
reader that is parsing through that OPML file, which is no more than XML, really, and it's trying

53
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,040
to, uh, departs out the information. Uh, so I haven't been able to fix that on my end right now.

54
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
I'm kind of going through it. Also, I don't maintain the entire directory, right? Only maintain

55
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,080
the top level at iPodder.org, and everyone else is pasting in uh, uh, sites along down the the

56
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,200
hierarchy of the tree. Um, so it's been breaking the directory in uh, iPodder in the lemon version.

57
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,040
And um, I'm desperately trying to figure out how to make that better, but uh, probably the the

58
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,320
the easiest fix right now would be for um, people on the receiving side to filter out crap characters

59
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,640
as they come in, but it's a problem. Uh, definitely working on that on my end.

60
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,480
Hey, they're Adam and name Scott, and uh, but checking out your podcast for a couple of weeks,

61
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,840
believe it or not, as much as I say I'm into technology and actually my title is technical evangelist.

62
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,000
I have just discovered podcasting really enjoying it. My first podcast was your sound scene tour

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,440
of Miami, and I thought that was just the coolest damn thing. Now, I'm experimenting, um, and

64
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
and thinking about doing a podcast, my own. I've got to watch it because I am in commercial radio

65
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
and actually I was talking to my partner and I said, hey, we could do a podcast and we can do like

66
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,360
an uncensored show where I could look at you and say, hey, fuck off. And uh, and we could get away with

67
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
it, but you know, I've got away with those things, so I'm sure you understand that. But anyways,

68
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,280
I heard you doing the name that song, and I thought I would uh, send you over a few. I know I

69
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,080
love playing it myself and being a dishjockey in the 80s, 90s and still today.

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Hey, everybody. I enjoy playing this game here in a couple seconds of a song and I describe

71
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,840
you're not going to, oh, man, what the hell is that? Okay, this is indeed something that I've

72
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,280
really gotten into people sending in intros of songs and trying to stomp knees. Actually,

73
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,920
it's turned out to be relatively easy to stomp me. Uh, so let's see what this guy has lined up.

74
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,120
So, uh, the differences I've added and being a radio guy, I'm sure you can appreciate this.

75
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,080
The audio prisms. I've simulated the gender audio prism actually. The excellent. What

76
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,520
is talking about here is the processing that that we used to hear. Well, it's still here

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,120
it on a lot of top 40 radio stations that really compressed tight sound and everything's breathing

78
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,120
really quickly. And well, you'll hear it. I'm sure when he plays these songs. So he's not only

79
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,480
going to give me the trivia of 80s and I guess 90s songs or whatever, I'd actually, I'd prefer

80
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,600
50, 60, 70s and 80s. 90s is just shit for me. I wasn't paying any attention. Let's see if I can guess.

81
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,800
Hex are the original ones. Yep, to the music. Uh, so hopefully it'll have that pure 80 sound. So,

82
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,040
here we go. A quick couple of songs. Um, let's see if you know him. All right.

83
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,680
Oh, I give up on that.

84
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:20,000
All right. I know the song, but I just don't say I won't. Okay, go west. We close our eyes.

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can figure that one out now.

86
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, I sucked to the wish. I don't know what this is going for. All right. It made

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,680
thanks for checking it out. I'll let you know if I have a podcast on it. You know,

88
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,560
maybe I'll have to go underground. I was working on a couple of names. Maybe 88.1,

89
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,520
which was the frequency of my first, uh, Mr. microphone, or maybe I'll just call it Mr.

90
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,560
microphone. All right, Adam, enjoy the podcast and I'll keep subscribing. See you. Yeah. Okay.

91
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,320
That's, uh, ABC's look of love you're playing there. Oh, man. I sucked on that one.

92
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
Hope that you'll send in the answers or anyone, or someone will send in the answers to, uh,

93
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,240
to those trivia questions. Shoot. Oops. I thought I'd do a little bit better.

94
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,720
I talked about, uh, maybe working on some code. There's one thing that, uh, that I've been

95
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,040
looking for, and I've found different versions, but I couldn't get them to run, which usually

96
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:22,240
makes me want to go and make it myself. I'm looking for something very much like, uh, what was it?

97
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,400
Andrew Grummit made this dirt to RSS. We're basically you throw MP3 files into a directory and then

98
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,600
it automatically creates an RSS feed. Oh, a second. I actually had something here that

99
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,320
someone who has done something very much like it, uh, let me see. Is it up here? Yeah.

100
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,960
So what I want to do is I want to create an RSS feed of just random files that I,

101
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,560
that I collect because there's so much stuff that doesn't make sense to excerpt on the daily

102
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,920
source code because it would just be too long. But I think that, you know, I could pretty much

103
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,640
make a feed that would be entertaining to listen to. If you just subscribe to that, you'd get,

104
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,320
you know, podsafe music, you'd get, uh, a full podcast of, you know, the ones that I've enjoyed. So

105
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,800
I wouldn't automatically subscribe you to, uh, Don and Drew, however, um, you would maybe get

106
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,280
one or two really great episodes or ones that I liked a lot. And the interface for me would just be

107
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,880
dropping it into a folder on my desktop to be uploaded to a server and automatically, uh, create an RSS

108
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,080
file. Don't even need an HTML file really because I'll put all the show notes. Uh, and of course,

109
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,280
when you drop it into the folder, um, it should, uh, this program should, uh, scour through the,

110
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:41,360
uh, MP3 tags and create each enclosure and each item, um, uh, within the podcast feed based upon what's

111
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,080
in the ID3 tags. And then this morning, as I was taking Christina to school, actually, in the way back,

112
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,840
I had this on my iPod, uh, loaded up, uh, and was playing it through the i-trip on the car stereo.

113
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,160
And this sounded very much like what I'm looking for. Hi, this is Kim and Ken from Shakespeare

114
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,520
to Flay and Homeschool Habitat to podcast we do. Ken has made a fabulous program that he would

115
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,680
like to tell everyone about. It's called podcastmatic and, uh, basically what it does, it's a

116
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:18,880
pro script that will generate your HTML index webpage and your RSS feed, um, and it bases the, the data

117
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:26,160
in those files off of your MP3 tags. So tag up your MP3s with your comments and, uh, all that

118
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:35,200
good stuff and, uh, you can generate the webpage and the RSS.xml feed automatically. Auto magically.

119
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,080
And just for what, like, 20 easy payments of $20 a month? Nope. Not even. How much?

120
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,320
Only zero cents and zero dollars. You're doing this for free because you love mankind.

121
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,640
I love. Okay. And also, if you must pay us back, pay us back by becoming subscribers to our

122
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,480
podcasts, um, Homeschool Habitat and Shakespeare to Flay, where can they find your program, Ken?

123
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,800
They can find my program at Bradley. Chicago dot i-l dot u-s slash projects slash podcast

124
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,560
and you can find our podcasts at, uh, a very similar website, Bradley dot Chicago dot i-l dot

125
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:24,160
u-s slash h-h for Homeschool Habitat for SS Shakespeare, so Flay. Yep. So I downloaded the, uh,

126
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,760
the pro script, um, and it, it looks like it does exactly what I wanted to. You can set parameters

127
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,360
so it can run locally in a, in a folder, um, but it'll know that it's updated on a remote folder.

128
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,520
So I had it all set up and then I tried to run it. Remember, I'm the guy who, who didn't get

129
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,200
much further than Apple script. And I immediately threw an error asking for an XML module. Now,

130
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,640
I learned that on OSX, um, or at least the install that I have, if you're going to terminal and

131
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,640
you type in CPAN, which is kind of the, uh, the central repository for, um, uh, for all these

132
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,360
pro modules. Uh, and then, uh, space and then you type the name colon whatever. So it was like, uh,

133
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,480
XML colon colon, uh, death or whatever. I can't remember what it was. It was actually in the, uh,

134
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,840
in the read me file. Then it downloads all that, um, and it starts to install that module. But then

135
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:23,840
it broke because for some apparent reason, um, on a Mac, the pro install is not standard, um,

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,480
let me see if I can, uh, tell you what it says. Excuse me, um, what happened when I was

137
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,880
installing. Yeah, here's what it does. Um, it gives it throws this error about at at sign ink.

138
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:47,280
And then it basically says that, uh, uh, let's see, it's something with the Darwin thread multi-two

139
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,160
level, because it's not installed in the right place and then what happens is, uh, it fails on

140
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,320
comp, compiling these, uh, these, uh, these C-pan modules that I bring in. Clearly not something that

141
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,080
is going to work for people who just want to drop something in the folder, I know how to medically

142
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,160
create a podcast feed. Um, so I decided, uh, after about an hour, I said, fuck it, I'm not going to

143
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,960
try and reinstall Pearl because I know I'm just going to screw everything up. Um, and I actually

144
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,000
had asked Marcus to, uh, to hack something up in front here for me, front here or radio, whatever,

145
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,040
do something in user talk. And I don't know, we actually went through, uh, a list of stuff that

146
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,200
would that I would want it to do. And so he's probably working on that. Um, but, uh, well, if, if you

147
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,240
see a feed show up, then you know that I got something working. So that's just to call out to developers.

148
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,960
If you're, um, if you're working on anything very similar, that, uh, doesn't necessarily need some,

149
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,440
some install that won't, of Pearl that won't work on my Mac. I'd love to hear about it.

150
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,800
Okay, uh, let's see, uh, from pod castematic. Oh, yeah, you know, when I was in Holland,

151
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,520
taxi Eric, uh, who's the cab driver who I've, you know, used for years now for, for almost five

152
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,520
years since we've been living, since we've had a house in Amsterdam. He's kind of like my getaway guy,

153
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,040
you know, it's like my robber bank, I'm calling up him because he'll drive me to safety.

154
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,200
And, uh, and he, he really takes care of a lot of stuff for me and for, and for the family,

155
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,320
when Christina was, uh, when we're living there, you take Christina to school and it's just these

156
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,240
to great guys, part of the family. And he was, you know, he was, he read a lot about podcasting. He's

157
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,720
heard a lot about it. He hears me on the phone in the car. He never really understood it. And then I

158
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,760
said, you know what, Eric, why don't you just tune the radio to 88.3, which is what I have my

159
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,280
eye trips set to. And then I played for him the jet lag edition of the Rock and Old Geek Show. This

160
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,320
is the one where Michael Butler just got back from the two-week European tour. It is fucking hilarious.

161
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,920
And it's an English. And of course, Eric speaks English because he actually used to be on an oil

162
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,040
rig, uh, fly out two weeks on two weeks off. So he was exposed to lots of English. And of course,

163
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,440
his customers speak English. So his English is above average for a foreigner. And in the Netherlands,

164
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,920
most people speak English anyway, but he was, he loved the Rock and Old Geek Show. He was cracking

165
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,960
up, particularly the way Michael Butler was, you know, kind of explaining the scene with the girls

166
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,080
and, you know, girls and Sweden and which girls were cute or the ones in Sweden or Denmark.

167
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,840
And hey, wait a minute, take a picture of me with the big cans of hyenic. And it was just, it was

168
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,240
beginning to end. It was hilarious. And in that Michael also does a driving with Butler or

169
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,160
boating with Butler, which is kind of like a sound scene. Uh, only he narrates it a little bit more

170
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,120
and interviews people and sticks the mic in their faces. And all of a sudden, Eric got it. He was like,

171
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,560
oh shit, this is what you're doing. Said, yeah. And then as he said that, I press pause. He said,

172
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,120
what'd you do? I stopped the radio show. He said, you can do that? No, and of course, he's not an idiot,

173
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,280
right? He understands very well what MP3 players are. His daughters have an MP3 player. He's got

174
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,960
cable motor, and a PC at home. But just to have all those bits connect and to actually

175
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,160
hear it on the radio, he was completely blown away, which tells me a lot about where we have to go

176
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,680
still with podcasting. We have to make it easier still. I think I was talking about that yesterday

177
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,040
where, you know, we're kind of, no one is really quite hit the sweet spot of a player and an

178
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,440
eye potter at the same time. You know, most eye potters are good at getting podcasts, but they're

179
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:24,720
not necessarily the best aggregators, because, well, I think quite frankly, you know, it takes a while

180
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,640
before you figure out what your aggregator has to do and what you need it to do. And it's also,

181
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,320
none of them are really great players. A lot of them are using the internal quick time players,

182
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,520
or some other player that works on Windows. So, you know, we're just trying to hit the sweet

183
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,080
spot of moving away. I don't know if we can move it away. I mean, currently,

184
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,560
eye potter talks to eye tunes. You know, so we have two listings of files in eye tunes and an eye

185
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,000
potter. And the same thing with net news wire that I'm trying out this week. So, just stuff to think about.

186
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,640
You're almost really want to have, I don't know, in Eric's case, you want to have just a box

187
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
that can, you know, maybe the eye pot shuffle with an eye trip, you know, maybe there's a combination.

188
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,800
I mean, maybe we just need a very small storage device with a transmitter on it. Optional headphones,

189
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,040
of course. But one that really just gives you one or two podcasts a day, which will pretty much

190
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,800
be the limit of the, of the eye pot shuffle. That you can just grab with you, put it in the car

191
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,000
and place the two or three shows that you always listen to on your commute. Maybe we have to

192
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,440
think a lot smaller before we think bigger. And I do believe that we, we totally have to get much closer

193
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,000
to this all happening on the device. I had another idea, by the way, since I've been playing with the

194
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,160
eye river, maybe instead of having eye potter copy files over to eye tunes, we set up a way.

195
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,280
And I don't think this works very well on Windows, but if you plug in the eye river or any other

196
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,480
USB storage device on a Mac, it pops open pretty much always, I think it's always, it always has

197
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,800
the same name, a granted that name is often untitled, but it will mount on your desktop. I guess we

198
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,600
could make an eye pot or look for that, you know, if so, if you basically plug it in and all

199
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,760
of sudden the new volume mounts, which is titled, I, I, F, P, 799 or whatever, the then all the

200
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,160
downloaded podcast should be just basically copied over. And in that case, you know, we kind of

201
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,640
route around iTunes, which I think, and also Windows Media Center, which I think we're going to have to

202
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,960
do. It's going to, you know, either we have to incorporate it into those players or we have to

203
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,520
route around it. So maybe another thing that we could look into is a plugin for iTunes. That's something

204
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,960
that Madge Weinstein actually suggested when I, when I, when I called her a while back from

205
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,360
Miami. So anyway, just shit, there's one thing in my head today. It's a Monday, so, you know,

206
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,200
shit runs freely, podcast, tell you, okay. Hi there Adam, thanks very much indeed for playing the

207
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,520
promo on your show, how few days ago. And but a week and a half Adam, I've had 12,000 hits,

208
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,480
which has been brilliant, so thanks very much for that. It strikes me Adam that the UK is the

209
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,200
poor relation. And that's, uh, we over here in the UK, really should have a podcast conference,

210
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,040
podcast con, UK, I'll be speaking to a number of guys who are doing podcasts over here,

211
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:27,680
uh, dot com, post dot com, uh, hoxfm.co.uk. And a few of the guys as well, and in fact, we're,

212
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:35,600
we're looking probably at putting a meat together. And, uh, I've put a link on my site, podcast,

213
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Paul.com. Um, so if you go to the podcast con, UK, uh, sites, it should take you through to, uh,

214
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,880
a page, tell you a little bit about it. I'm also going to put a pay weblog. I'll be a couple of

215
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,560
authors myself, uh, rarely, uh, Richard, they put a place I've just mentioned to you. And I'll send

216
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,600
you a link as well, Adam, um, so that we can contribute and put things on there. But, um, any

217
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,120
UK listeners do send me an email, please, or, uh, puts something on the weblog, uh,

218
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,240
enjoying your show as ever, uh, Adam, I get really frustrated when you don't do one, because, um,

219
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,960
I feel like I have to film a time with something else like work or something. I think I may,

220
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,640
thanks very much, indeed, all the very best. And do email. P, I podcast, P, dot com.

221
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,200
P, podcast, podcast, wake it, wake it, wake it, wake it, wake it, wake it,

222
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,640
I love it. That's great. Podcast Paul. Okay. There's also, um, uh, there's all kinds of podcast,

223
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,160
conferences and stuff that people are working on, which is pretty exciting. Um, working on some

224
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:48,560
in the states. I think there's one being considered for Minneapolis, um, about midway through the

225
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,440
year, uh, I believe there's, you know, some stuff in the UK. Yeah. Yeah. Of course, I'm being invited

226
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,640
to every single one. I don't think I can actually make it to every single one. Hey, how about some,

227
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,440
uh, some rock and tunes? How about a mashup here? I'm ready for a good mashup. This is a mashup

228
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,800
of one of my favorite podcasters. If you've never heard yeast radio and you don't know who

229
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,240
Madge Weinstein is, then beware. The following mashup is not safe for work.

230
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,520
Hello, everybody. This is Madge Weinstein.

231
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,320
I'm so sick. Okay. I'm 40. Do you realize what's going on? These people are fucking crazy

232
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:42,160
and have no business running the country. You meal concert and serve it at 80 years.

233
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,560
You know, let's say your husband comes home and he's like, stinks like pussy and you say,

234
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,200
we used to be good with somebody else and then a husband says no. And then she says,

235
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,840
I don't believe you. The husband goes with me. Are you calling me a liar?

236
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:13,920
Fucking bullshit. What ever the fuck you are? People that I hate.

237
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:26,160
Fucking obvious. El Presidente says fucking fucking fucking self.

238
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,320
President Bush, it's about the fucking roof, what you said.

239
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,720
Okay, now explain to me.

240
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,800
Did you listen?

241
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,480
Fucking obvious.

242
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,960
Fucking obvious.

243
00:23:50,960 --> 00:24:04,400
How can you tell me that these people have any business running a country?

244
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,680
It's blandest. Please, she's got balls. Madge Weinstein in the mashup.

245
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,800
The ACDC mashup featuring Madge Weinstein Eastradio.com. I was going to call

246
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,440
Madge over the weekend. We've been trying to hook up for over a week now. But the time difference

247
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,400
is a little screwed up. And Madge actually was off to VloggerCon in New York City and was interviewing

248
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,280
people and calling stuff through an openpodcast.org. And yeah, just some some good stuff.

249
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,960
Again, Eastradio.com is where you can find all things Madge. And from one end of the spectrum,

250
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,120
all the way to the other one, it comes to podcasts. Here's something about an educational use of podcasting.

251
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,400
Cole?

252
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,360
Hey Adam, my name's Cole Campbell. I'm a faculty member at Penn State University and director

253
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,960
of the IST Solutions Institute. I'm a podcaster. I have been for a while, have my own podcast.

254
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,240
But that's not really what I'm here to talk to you about. What I really wanted to let you know

255
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,000
was, is that I'm part of a group from not only Penn State University, but for other universities

256
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,040
around the country, part of the Apple Digital Campus. And two of us Penn State and the Missouri School

257
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,440
of Journalism got together with Educaz to make sure that all the sessions are a good number

258
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,880
of them were podcasted at the NLI annual meeting being held at New Orleans starting today, Sunday,

259
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,520
the 23rd, and pushing through to a Wednesday. We're doing some presentations on a whole lot of

260
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,960
other stuff. But the really cool thing is we convinced Educaz to set up blog spaces, to set up

261
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,360
enclosure hacks that work with the RSS feeds and everything. And you're able to go ahead and get

262
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,160
all that stuff downloaded to your iPod or whatever MP3 player and listen to it. What I thought you'd

263
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,920
find interesting was the fact that we're taking some of the work that you've pioneered

264
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,520
and we're moving in an education in a way that I really think is going to make an impact.

265
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,000
Some of us have even been doing it in the classroom and our students actually really enjoy it.

266
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,160
So I'm going to include the promo piece, maybe you want to play that, but other than that,

267
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,680
have a good time, enjoy it, and I'll catch you on the other side with the URL.

268
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,080
All right, let's play the promo then. All right. Hi, my name is Kyle Palmer and I'm a student at the

269
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,040
University of Missouri Journalism School in Columbia. I love keeping up on the news and I always

270
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,000
want to know about the latest things happening in the world, but sometimes I can get busy, you know,

271
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,920
class gets in the way. So I may miss the news on radio or may not be able to get back to my computer

272
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,000
to listen to NPR's webcast. But a new technology called podcasting may help me out.

273
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,680
So all I have to do is download an audio file of a newscast and interview our speech on my iPod

274
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,960
or MP3 player and go. That's it. Here during the NRI conference, you'll have the chance to use podcasting.

275
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,920
Over the next two days, you'll be able to download audio files that include conference presentations

276
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,840
and stories about some of the biggest topics we're talking about, like the balance between a

277
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,360
multi-tasking student like myself and faculty members trying to grasp the technology that I've

278
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,080
grown up with. Well, tell you, you know, this is this is totally right for education, by the way.

279
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,560
I know we've talked about this before. I'm so happy to see this happening. And wow,

280
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,720
what an opportunity for someone to really set that up right and make it work and come up with

281
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,480
some packages for educational institutions who are just looking for an easy way to disseminate

282
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,320
information. Isn't that kind of what teaching is about going from one to the next,

283
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,520
passing information on from one person to the next, sounds like podcasting to me?

284
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,520
I need a black star ship, racist through the time and space stream with one mission to make

285
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,280
as much havoc as possible. This is the ship of the evil mastermind Dr. Steven is suck shaped

286
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,800
assistant fidget. The reviews are written fidget. The radio adventures of Dr. Floyd podcast is a hit.

287
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,960
Yes, look at this. Five stars from podcastbunker.com. Four and a half stars from podcast reviews.net.

288
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,920
Tracks of the tree calls the Dr. Floyd podcast laugh out loud funny and says it'll make a dreamer

289
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,520
out of anyone who listens. PLPH radio says Dr. Floyd is good for all ages and delivers the

290
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,800
good. Well, yes, apparently one of a few podcasts that's fun for the whole family. You

291
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,240
know, safe for kids, fun for adults and all that. It's even become a syndicated show on godcast.org.

292
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,240
There's only one problem. Well, none of these reviews mentioned how absolutely fantastic I am.

293
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,720
So I guess I'm going to have to ramp up the evil then. The kid gloves are off. It's time to put

294
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,160
the evil pedal to the metal and it's several other cliches that mean. I'm going to become even

295
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,760
more evil until the reviewers stand up and take notice.

296
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,600
Oh, no, Dr. Steve is just one. It's to become even more evil than he already is.

297
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,600
We'll Dr. Floyd and his rag tag bunching heroes be able to prevent Dr. Steve from causing more trouble

298
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,520
throughout history. The only way to find out is to tune in each week to the radio adventures of Dr. Floyd

301
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,920
I'm actually pretty hooked on the radio adventures of Dr. Floyd. PW Fenton puts that together.

302
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,760
It is a completely family safe show but it's weird and it's twisted and it's it reminds me a lot

303
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:20,880
actually of peel. Jump peel. Jump peel. I think it's jump peel, right? The the famous English DJ

304
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,640
who you see if I'm right about that. P.B.C. Peel. Jump peel. Why am I thinking? Yeah, jump peel,

305
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,920
right? He passed away just recently but he had kind of those those types of shows. A little bit

306
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,680
twisted, a little bit weird but cool. Definitely check it out and subscribe to it. And I got an email

307
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,920
from who was this from a young bullet. He's a Dutch guy. He said, you know, I've been listening to

308
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,200
the Daily Source code and I've been listening to all the songs you're playing including the

309
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,600
list of the obvious bitties. He says, now I heard this song you don't own me by the bitties which I

310
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:05,680
played and he said, it sounds to the T just maybe maybe one or two bars off and you know if you

311
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,680
twist and time stretch a little bit they'll actually fit together very well. He says it sounds just

312
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:20,480
like this song from 1982 by Dutch guy called Andrey Hazes and the song that he did was called

313
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:28,320
the Sechmannitsmeer. So just listening to the two titles I immediately could put them together

314
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,640
and because I know both songs the Dutch one from 82 now was Sechmannitsmeer and the bitties

315
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,120
says, you don't own me. So he actually sent, he mixed these two up. It's not really a mashup.

316
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,920
In fact, you'll go, huh? They're like, what the hell is this? But you can hear that it's basically

317
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,520
the same song. He also sent this mix to the bitties and Leanne is so crazy about it. She wants

318
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:58,240
to now record the Dutch version of the song. So let's listen to this mashup of the bitties and

319
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:10,000
Andrey Hazes. On broadcasting with Andrey. It's separated left and right for your convenience.

320
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay, so that was, if you're listening on the headphones, I probably trip you out. I think they

321
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,720
are actually one octave higher than Andrey Hazes. But same song. Very, very cool. So we'll see

322
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,000
if the bitties come out with a Dutch version of that anytime soon. Thank you very much, Yon,

323
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,000
for being, yeah, for being on the ball there and actually taking the time out to mix those

324
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,720
dude together. Let's see, 36 minutes into the show. Actually, 32 minutes. Oh, we can just have some

325
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,000
time here. I had put these set these aside. Didn't think I'd have time for them. A couple of

326
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,960
geek podcast promos that I wanted to play for you because, well, I'll shoot. You know, I listen to

327
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:33,440
my like them. Hey Adam, this is Craig Shumaker from the Polymorphic podcast at drs75.com. That's drazz75.com.

328
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,920
I heard on your show today that you said you need to figure out some dot net stuff. I'm a dot net developer

329
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,480
and my podcast is about software development and the dot net environment. So if there's anything

330
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,520
I can do to help or if you need, you know, anything at all. So please let me know. Thanks.

331
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,160
Okay. Well, when I get my windows machine or let, you know, I have no idea what this dot net

332
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,120
stuff is about, but I definitely want to try out the mixed cast live stuff. I wonder how this

333
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,000
going? That was a dot net application. Haven't heard anything about it. Who was that? Oh, that's

334
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,440
Patricia. She's just rolling up into the driveway. Another promo for you. Hello, Adam. My name is Jeremy

335
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,000
and I'm from linuxquestions.org. We have a new podcast that I thought some of the daily source

336
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,680
code listeners might be interested in. The LQ podcast focuses on Linux and open source related

337
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:25,000
issues, we're also working on a live Linux and open source radio show called lq radio.

338
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,240
Both the LQ podcast and lq radio can be found at lqradio.org. Thanks. Adam. Boyo.

339
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,880
Yeah, pouring back at your melody. Okay. Time for some pod save tunes here on the daily source.

340
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,160
Code. This is from Andrew neatly. I think was reported in his apartment in New York city.

341
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,840
Check out Pretty Girl on the daily.

342

Every world can step in together

369
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,220
We're headed to call the black market

370
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,300
We should just stay

371
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,540
Ready, go home to walk just where you're coming

372
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,260
Stay and I'll set that for now

373
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,260
You'll be too late

374
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,380
Pretty girl and do kneesley on the daily source code

375
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,020
Could you mind coming in for a second because we Patricia just came home and we were actually

376
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:05,020
It started off. She just walked into the studio and she said I was ring the doorbell

377
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Yeah, you didn't hear me. I'm sorry

378
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,140
We haven't talked to the daily source code listeners about my hair yet

379
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,740
Do you want to they have not seen a picture? Would you like to explain what happened?

380
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,980
They don't want to see a picture. Oh, thank you. Yeah

381
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,100
Well, you needed a haircut

382
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,060
So you didn't tell them at all that you needed a haircut. Of course I did. I said it that we went to salmon days

383
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Tony and guy

384
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,180
My sister said who used to live in in London, you know Tony and guy. That's it hip

385
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:41,260
Salmon day if you look inside the that Salon you see those

386
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,420
Sort of goths, you know very hip people

387
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:54,460
Let's let this be a warning if you see a barber shop or hairdresser with with Gothic looking people that are you know black clothes black shoes black hair

388
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,620
Beware they are the stars

389
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:03,020
Yeah, you can see that we're hip we know you know what kind of hair you need so the two of us

390
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:12,460
Went in and ask for one of the books, you know where you see pictures of all sorts of hairdo's and we pointed out

391
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,140
One hairdo. May I say that you pointed out the hairdo?

392
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,380
We knew exactly because you had it before so I said this is what we want a little bit

393
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,220
Longer in the neck a little bit of hair on your foot thicker on top longer in the back, please

394
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,900
And and some hair on your rod have a high forehead with all the brains in it

395
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,620
So cover of the brains a bit and

396
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,380
So is it this is it? This is exactly what we want so I dropped you off

397
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:46,620
This was the mistake. I never should have let you never let my mom just drop me off you should have stayed there with me

398
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:53,820
You like watching my back. I didn't have my glasses on like a good mom. I dropped you off, you know trusting these people

399
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:00,860
And you trusted them with your child damage. I child we made the wonderful the gorgeous hair

400
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,260
You know that you have who's penis is bigger than David Bowie's and one point out

401
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
All your hair is short enough

402
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,860
If you had to choose

403
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
What between short hair or

404
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,380
It doesn't man. It's not it's not it's all in the knob

405
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:27,340
No, no, it's not it's not it's a combination of things of course

406
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:34,860
Hair and arm no, no because our people would know hair at all so you can and which which bald guys do you find sexy

407
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,460
I am three

408
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,820
But um so I dropped you off and

409
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,500
I went shopping remember and you came home and I said to my sister Iván who stayed here

410
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,860
I said well, I'm so curious about his hair. I thought it's gonna be lovely. I mean one of the best hipster

411
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
hair salons there there

412
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,980
so

413
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,580
So when we come home you were hiding behind the door which was of course

414
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
a bad sign

415
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,620
And I said so how is and I still thought you were joking so and when you just

416
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,580
When you open the door and I looked

417
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,820
Behind the door I could not believe it you were a sort of a genre dog

418
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,380
You remember that

419
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,740
It was just like the rats were eating on it and

420
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,060
Nibbling on it and yeah and

421
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,260
One side was even shorter than the other side

422
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,940
That's hip baby. No hair on your forehead. It was so short. They thinned it out

423
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,900
Now have you ever if you have wonderful hair. Why would you? Did it look at all like the picture?

424
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,420
Absolutely not and I am afraid to go in there because I'm gonna kill her

425
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:00,780
I will make such a no really because I don't want to go in there every time I see that store

426
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,540
When I pass a bite it's a the seven-day store

427
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,220
I just I can her name was Eve

428
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,860
She gave you a car. She was really nice. Yeah. She gave you a car like oh

429
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,540
I'm Eve so remember that well we we we will remember that

430
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,100
I could kill her really and thank god hair grows but

431
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,700
You're I know you know don't laugh because you're laughing now. Why I know you're very unhappy about it

432
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,460
You're in terrible fall mood from me

433
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,420
Bullshit you're in a fall. Don't don't wink at me. This is a podcast baby. You got to be honest

434
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,380
You have to be honest on the podcast. I know why I know you're very unhappy about it

435
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:48,860
I'm not happy. Let's put it out now. I mean how does it look like? Well, I don't know. Do you know there's those things that you

437
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,100
That's how it looks. I thought I'd look more like a chia pet actually. Yeah, now it's just unbelievable

438
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,540
She didn't even look at the structure of the hair or the type that you are you're tall you are

439
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,140
