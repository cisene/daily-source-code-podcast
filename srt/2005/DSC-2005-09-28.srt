Delta Shara Charming 2, 4, 8

00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,000
There are no secrets

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, if I may win you, don't be a liar

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, Adam Curry

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Transmitters?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the street

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Fantastic, it's Adam Curry

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And it's Wednesday, September 28th in the year of our Lord 2005

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How boring is it if I say it's another sunny day in Northern California?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It really is, I can't believe I have not had serious fog for the past 10 days at least

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's what you get, man, you go on vacation, you come out to Southern California

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It sucks, you're here working and it's beautiful

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Halfway through the week and almost on my way back to the UK

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I must say, yesterday is a couple of things

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It really reminded me how much I want to be back

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll talk about that today

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Got the promos for you, some resolutions

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Press away in my old show notes

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There's some resolution on a couple of items

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Obviously some kick-ass pod save music

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And today we have a backtracks podcast

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So stay tuned for that

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It is the daily source code

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
As of tomorrow, we'll be silent

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As of tomorrow, we'll be silent

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
As of tomorrow, we'll be silent

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's right, serious satellite radio

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
New line up, new channel

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
New experience is coming out

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As of tomorrow, this program daily source code will be

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Not only a podcast, actually it will be a podcast first

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then it will be broadcast on the channel 103 on serious stars

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, I'll feel so at home there, no one I

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, got the Capitino ready to go

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It seems like, I don't know if it just back to school or what it is

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But the mashups are flowing in again

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He sent me three or four over the past couple of days

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But the one that came in today was

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Without a doubt when I wanted to share with you

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000

Search for your arm

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There's no point in that

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000

Story of the Indians, you can smile

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
When you're just living in the sky

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're very vulnerable when you die

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000

And you want to go

To the cold mouth

The rain has to go a lot of nice girls

108
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
The rain has to go a lot of nice girls

109
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
The rain has to go a lot of nice girls

110

It was� Chin going so far

111
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,420

The rain has to go a lot of my niez

113
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:47,420
Oh yeah, the Jay Zebra, for more info on that mashup and many other awesome mashups

114
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,420
head over to mashuptown.com.

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,420
I'll be waiting for you at the door ready to help you out.

116
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
And it is official.

117
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
My friends listeners to the Daily Source Code.

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,420
I am now in the inner circle of geekdom.

119
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Oh yes.

120
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Then there's two clues.

121
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Two clues that I'm the inner circle of geekdom.

122
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,420
First of all, let me just grab this.

123
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Yesterday, a list came out.

124
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,420
A list published by who publishes this.

125
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,420
SiliconagendaSetters.com.

126
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,420
Apparently it's an annual list.

127
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,420
It is the AgendaSetters 2005.

128
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,420
The top 50 people who set the agenda.

129
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,420
And there's some awesome names on this.

130
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Number one Eric Schmidt CEO of Google.

131
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Number two Steve Jobs CEO of Apple.

132
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
And it's Ashley Highfield.

133
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
I'm holding a printout.

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,420
I should have brought that up on my web browser.

135
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,420
I could click on them to tell you all these people.

136
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,420
I don't know some of the people in the top 10.

137
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,420
I know Robert Murdoch and number eight.

138
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,420
And see Linus Torvalz and number 11.

139
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
Sir Jay and Larry at 12.

140
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
And that is number 13.

141
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
There you have it.

142
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
Adam Curry geek at number 13.

143
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,420
One spot above Steve Balmer.

144
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,420
Bill Gates checks in the 20 Jeff Bezos at 21.

145
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Let's see Meg Whittman.

146
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
Number 26 Mark Cuban.

147
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
34.

148
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
This is cool.

149
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
I don't know really what it means.

150
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,420
But I feel I feel very honored.

151
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,420
But not nearly as honored as what happened this morning.

152
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,420
So how long have we been talking about Gmail?

153
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
The first of all, the fact that I love Gmail.

154
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
Second of all.

155
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,420
And I really I got into it mainly for the for the storage.

156
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Passive because it would start off with one gigabyte.

157
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,420
And then it quickly moved to two gigabytes.

158
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,420
And then infinity plus one.

159
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,420
And it's been fantastic for me and for other podcasts.

160
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
There's a like to use Gmail.

161
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,420
For the simple reason that it's a great way to get audio feedback and have a place

162
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,420
where to actually go, you know, as long as it's 10 megs or under 10 megs,

163
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,420
then it'll always be accepted into the Gmail account.

164
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,420
And besides that, I mean, I'm totally into the whole search-based email thing.

165
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
And it integrates nicely with the blackberry.

166
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,420
But the problem with the daily source code is that I received so many pieces of audio feedback

167
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,420
and so many MP3 files that I eventually wind up having to delete stuff and have been

168
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,420
scurrying at the 99% full on your Gmail account for, I don't know, for months now.

169
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,420
It seems like.

170
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,420
So this morning, imagine waking up going through, well, of course, first I went through email

171
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
my blackberry, right?

172
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,420
We all know that I wake up when I'm in San Francisco.

173
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
That is I wake up.

174
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,420
I open my eyes and oh, yes, let's check some email.

175
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,420
There's no one else around, it doesn't matter.

176
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,420
And then I went to my computer to do the show prep for today.

177
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,420
You always have stuff that I tag and I flag so that I can, or label, I should say,

178
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,420
and Gmail speak so that that's meant for the daily source code.

179
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,420
And I always do a check, you know, I say, okay, I can actually send a reply to someone

180
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,420
because if you hit 100%, then you can keep receiving email.

181
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,420
Probably, I think I've seen to go to 104, 105% full.

182
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,420
So the incoming email, it won't start rejecting your email, which I think is a very,

183
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
very friendly user-friendly feature.

184
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,420
But it does say, sorry, you can't send email because you're over your quota.

185
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,420
Guess what?

186
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,420
My quota jumped to four gigs.

187
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,420
Now I'm truly in the inner circle of geek-dom.

188

Ever wonder what your local Avon Lady might be up to?

196
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Listen to beauty dish radio and find out what Avon Lady Party Jaworski does.

197
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,420
You'll be surprised.

198
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,420
That sounds hot.

199
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,420
I have to check that one out.

200
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
What does my Avon Lady really do?

201
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,420
She looked kind of hot in the picture.

202
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,420
I haven't subscribed to the show yet, but I thought the promo was intriguing enough.

203
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,420
So, of course, I, you'll notice that I was able to actually get to my Gmail.

204
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,420
A new four gigabyte Gmail account.

205
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,420
That's because I did find, as you know, I found a spot that actually does pretty much work

206
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,420
on this Benbo Open Wi-Fi that is not in my building is from somewhere outside.

207
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
I'm pretty sure.

208
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,420
Benbo 7.

209
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,420
There are many other access points that I can, that I can see,

210
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,420
is just that they're all password protected, which, of course, makes sense.

211
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
Lots of people want to do that.

212
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,420
And then it kind of hit me that there's a minor problem with the idea of free Open Wi-Fi.

213
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
And I'm not quite sure how to solve it.

214
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
I don't know if it's in the protocol or not.

215
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,420
Imagine this. Imagine I fire up my power book and I open it up.

216
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,420
And I see a whole bunch of networks to connect to.

217
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,420
And I see, you know, here's a really strong signal coming in from,

218
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,420
there's always a default that always has a very strong signal,

219
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,420
but even though it's default, it's still locked up.

220
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,420
When you go, when you try to access it, it says,

221
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
okay, please enter the password.

222
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,420
That's the point where, and this is what I'm really missing,

223
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,420
is where if I, you know, on my open networks,

224
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,420
I'd like to say, hey, or maybe keep it closed,

225
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,420
but say, hey, this isn't network that you can access.

226
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
Just send me an email.

227
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Let me know how long you needed for what you're doing,

228
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,420
where you are, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

229
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,420
A temporary password could even be assigned or just, you know,

230
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,420
just to make it easy, just the password.

231
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
And you send an email that you get the password.

232
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,420
And maybe you could even contribute to some of the bandwidth

233
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,420
costs.

234
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
I'm sure that that would work.

235
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,420
You don't have to give out anything big, just your email address.

236
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,420
And I thought, well, could you put that into the,

237
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,420
into the actual network name, that really doesn't work that well.

238
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
So I don't know if there's a field somewhere,

239
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,420
or some way that we can let users know, hey,

240
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,420
this is a password protected Wi-Fi access point, a hotspot,

241
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,420
but you're happy to, you know, you welcome to use it,

242
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,420
just fire me off an email and let me know what the deal is.

243
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,420
And that is the, of course, no one ever expected Wi-Fi

244
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,420
to become, I guess, such a community resource.

245
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,420
So maybe there's something we can do about that.

246
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,420
Maybe there is something in the protocol that can make it pop up

247
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
or something that, yeah, just a pop up,

248
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
something like that would be very cool.

249
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,420
And of course, there are other ways to do it,

250
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,420
you know, with like a radius server and have common logins,

251
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
but I want to be really simple.

252
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,420
I want someone to be able to get a Wi-Fi hotspot out of the box,

253
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,420
install it, put a password in, put their email address in.

254
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,420
If someone wants to use it, they just fire off an email,

255
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
and then you just decide whether you want to open it up or not,

256
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
depending on the person's approach.

257
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,420
It's just a thought.

258
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,420
So as I was going through all those thought processes,

259
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,420
I said, well, of course, I need connectivity here in the condo,

260
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
because this isn't, this is not going to work.

261
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Now I have to go to the office to upload,

262
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
because download is just like an,

263
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
a barely an iffy thing.

264
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,420
What is, what about this EVDO that I keep hearing about?

265
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
I actually did a little bit of research on the,

266
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,420
on the half broken link that I had last night.

267
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,420
So EVDO is, I guess it's a three,

268
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,420
a third generation cellular technology,

269
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,420
which is very similar to what in Europe would be called UMTS,

270
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,420
at least from the consumer standpoint.

271
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
I'm sure technically is very different.

272
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,420
But it gives you anywhere from 700 kilobite download

273
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,420
to two megs, depending on burstable speeds I guess.

274
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,420
And I couldn't quite find what the upload speed was,

275
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,420
but it also seemed to be somewhere between 200 and 300 kilobites,

276
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,420
or kilobit, I should say.

277
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Maybe I should get that.

278
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,420
And because, you know, that's something that I could basically use anywhere.

279
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Because, to be honest,

280
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
I know that if I call the cable company,

281
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
I'm also going to order television.

282
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,420
You know, that's just bad for you.

283
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
You know, that's going to rot your brain.

284
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
So I don't want to call the cable company.

285
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
I don't want to wait for the guy to drop the box in.

286
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,420
Couldn't I just go by the Verizon wireless shop

287
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,420
and pick up an EVDO card.

288
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Now, I did read just about everywhere that Verizon does not,

289
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,420
or probably no one at this point supports McIntosh laptops

290
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
for their PC cards,

291
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,420
but people are able to get them to work.

292
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,420
It seems like there's a lot of confusion about which one to get.

293
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,420
So this is clearly something we're going to start off

294
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
a little threat about.

295
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Although I am leaving on Friday,

296
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,420
so if you can hurry up and give me some information,

297
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,420
it seems like there's the 52 50 card or something

298
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,420
that you can change some parameters in your Mac

299
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
and then it will work,

300
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,420
but you have to have it pre-installed when you ordered.

301
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
It's a little confusing to me.

302
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,420
So if you know of a system that will work

303
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,420
on a Mac out of the box,

304
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
or if you can explain how to do it,

305
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
feedback would be greatly appreciated.

306
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,420
I will probably do that in the show notes for today

307
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
on the Wiki show notes.

308
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
Which, of course, I also want to talk to you about

309
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,420
some cool stuff to discuss there as well.

310
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Tomorrow night in New York City,

311
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
Brother Loves,

312
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,420
throwing a little party.

313
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
I wish I could be there, man.

314
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,420
I bet it would be kick ass.

315
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
I was listening to Axon Hashtag last night

316
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,420
and CC played this track

317
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
and I said,

318
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,420
why something am, man.

319
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,420
It's really, really good.

320
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
There she goes.

321
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,420
Brother Loves on the daily source code.

322
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,420
And it's so good to you.

323
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
Whatever happens,

324
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,420
don't leave it so soon.

325
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,420
It's so right when it's okay.

326
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
Yeah,

327
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,420
get a little sore that anybody else says.

328
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Such a stubborn one,

329
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
I think I'm in love with you.

330
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
I come home.

331
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,420
You're such a sweet little honor.

332
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
You're small,

333
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
but you're still in the middle of me.

334
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Just that guy.

335
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
We'll go outside.

336
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,420
I don't want anything to do with it.

337
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
Yeah, I'm the girl.

338
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,420
And I've been told I can't win.

339
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
So there it is.

340
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
First you say you can't.

341
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
I'll let you say you can.

342
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,420
You don't want to take it just.

343
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Well,

344
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
my name is Arthur.

345
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,420
I'm a liberal.

346
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
I'm a liberal figure.

347
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
I've got a set of something.

348
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,420
Believe in me.

349
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Yes, you can.

350
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
Yes, you can.

351
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Yes, you can.

352
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Yes, you can.

353
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Yes, you can.

354
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Yes, you can.

355
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Yes, you can.

356
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,420
You know what?

357
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
No, no, no, no, no, no.

358
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
She's better.

359
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,420
And I should know that.

360
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,420
She'll be back again.

361
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Yes, you can.

362
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,420
Yes, you can.

363
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,420
Yes, you can.

364
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,420
She goes like it.

365
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Yes, you can.

366
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
Yes, you can.

367
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,420
Yes, you can.

368
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,420
So strange.

369
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
She died until the story.

370
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Oh!

371
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,420
She died until the glory is historia still.

372
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Let's continue, by.

373
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,420
And I'm going to love you for a friend.

374
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Love, I don't want to be a numeric, but I hope I don't want to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better

375
00:18:37,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Man a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man and to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be aitary man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to be a better man to

376
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

377
00:19:37,420 --> 00:20:00,320
Father love me risen out and just let me down, back to the other side, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Y-y-y I

378
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,120
I've got to lose my best, it goes again, yeah

379
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Best, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes

380
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,720
I've got to lose my best, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes

381
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Woo, woo, woo

382
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,920
Ah, we're into my clothes

383
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,120
Not Army brother

384
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,720
I'm shaggle for war, huh?

385
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,520
Uh-huh

386
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,720
Such a suck up

387
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
Brother love

388
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,720
There she goes, let me tell you man

389
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,320
If I had a record label

390
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
I'd signed this guy up in a heartbeat

391
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,720
In fact, I'm so frustrated

392
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,120
I might have to start a record label

393
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
With my first artist being brother love

394
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,120
This is so good, it's a little bit like aerosmith

395
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,720
Uh, the guy's got a great attitude, great vibe

396
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,920
Really, really love this song

397
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Let's talk about the show notes for a second

398
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,320
Seems that we have a wiki now that what an interesting name wiki

399
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,920
I think you

400
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,320
After I have my record label, I have another child

401
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,120
And I'll call him wiki

402
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,120
wiki, hi, I'm wiki, everybody

403
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,320
So we have a wiki that is working for show notes

404
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,120
Very well, I might say with time codes and

405
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,320
Links and people are getting back into the game

406
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Putting pictures in and it seems that there's a little community there

407
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
of show noteers that are working very very well

408
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,920
Now I've gotten a lot of complaints

409
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
I said we get to this

410
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,720
We're complaints more like comments

411
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,320
People of course really do love having the show notes

412
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,720
As a part of the RSS fee

413
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
That makes a lot of sense

414
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,320
And some of them even wanted as a part of the file

415
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,520
Although I don't think that's quite standard

416
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,320
How that works, you know, you're basically cutting and pasting stuff

417
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Into the lyrics field

418
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,320
And there are all kinds of ways to do that

419
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
But there are no tools, whatsoever

420
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
And it's poorly documented

421
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,520
And I think that iTunes doesn't quite work the way Windows Media player

422
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Does, doesn't work the way

423
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,720
Win Amp does

424
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,320
So that may not be something we can use right now

425
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,520
But definitely the show notes in the feed

426
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,120
And here's the thought I had

427
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,720
What if I release the daily source code on curry.com

428
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
But don't release it in the feed

429
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,320
So you can click it and download it

430
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
So the minute it's out

431
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,120
People who want to contribute to the show notes

432
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
Can listen to the show, can put the show notes in

433
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,920
And then when the show notes have some form

434
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,120
Then I basically put it in the feed and put it out there

435
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,520
Now it's going to put a delay in the release of the show

436
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,920
But I think it's, and it really shouldn't be all that bad

437
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
It's just, you know, if I can be pretty consistent

438
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
And other people can be consistent with the show notes

439
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,920
So it really should only delay the release of the show

440
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,520
To the RSS feed to the podcast feed by maybe what?

441
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
Maybe an hour or an hour and a half

442
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,720
So that's kind of the feed, the thought that I had

443
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Let me know what you think about that

444
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,320
Yeah, it seems like it seems like that

445
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
Would probably be the best way to do it

446
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,720
And really this is all because I'm just way too freaking like

447
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,720
I don't have the time anymore to do the show notes

448
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Of course, we don't have the budget to hire a producer

449
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Yet

450
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,720
The show's got to be making money first before we can hire staff for it

451
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,720
But I'm also completely into hiring virtual staff

452
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
So let's just say that's a

453
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
A hint

454
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Good morning Mr. Adam Curry

455
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
This is Chris from CC Radio

456
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
And I wanted to talk to you

457
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Quickly about biodiesel

458
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,720
I know it's been a hot topic on the source code as of late

459
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,720
I had the idea where the summer actually two put together a podcast

460
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,720
And I got so far as recording the first episode

461
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
And never really fell through it

462
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,720
It is on the internet

463
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,720
You can check out renewableradio.blogspot.com

464
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,720
But I was listening to the daily source code today

465
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Because I got an email from CC Chapman that there was a music on there

466
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I might enjoy

467
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
DSC 246

468
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
I believe

469
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
And you were talking with

470
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Oh, I forget his name over at the watt podcast

471
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
And I definitely subscribe to that

472
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I'm very interested in the topic of biodiesel

473
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
More importantly, alternative energy

474
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,720
The idea for my podcast

475
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,720
It's spawn from Google searches

476
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
It's set up Google searches for alternative energy, fossil fuel

477
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
And topics like that

478
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
And every week I still get

479
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
My inbox swamp of info and all this stuff

480
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,720
What I find interesting is that all the stuff

481
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Usually comes from foreign media

482
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,720
None of it is really about what's happening here in America

483
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,720
And essentially the way I see it

484
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
And I've explained this to other people

485
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
But and I kind of noticed it on the

486
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
The Watts site too

487
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
The old energy industry here in America

488
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Is very well connected because it used to be one company

489
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Standard Oil

490
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
And when that was broken up

491
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
The infrastructure was already in place for it

492
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,720
To kind of piggyback on itself

493
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Unfortunately the alternative energy industry

494
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Is a little less concentrated

495
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,720
And what I wanted to do with the podcast

496
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
And they still do once I find time

497
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Is to use that as a rallying cry

498
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Or a meeting ground if you will

499
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,720
For the alternative energy industry to come together

500
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I think we need to get together these

501
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Rock stars as you might call them of the industry

502
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
People that are scientists

503
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
People that are marketing

504
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Our business people lawyers the whole nine yards

505
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Because essentially what we need to do is

506
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Make it so that biodiesel or

507
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Essentially an alternative fuel is available

508
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,720
At every single gas station here in America

509
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
Without that

510
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Selling a car with an engine that runs on an alternative fuel

511
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Essentially useless because you

512
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Aren't guaranteed to be able to travel from point A

513
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,720
To point B if you run out of fuel

514
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,720
So I just wanted to drop you this audio

515
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Comment

516
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Say hey say thanks for playing

517
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Runswick

518
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,720
We appreciate it more than you ever imagined

519
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,720
And I want to keep the dialogue going

520
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,720
On alternative energy because I would like to get the

521
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Podcast off the ground and

522
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Hey maybe we could change the world

523
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,720
By the way Adam you might want to listen to the intro

524
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Of CC radio

525
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,720
There's a little snippet in there just for you

526
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Over and out I'll check you on the flip side

527
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
All right bud, take care

528
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Thanks grow back

529
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Well I must say that right now

530
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Having been in the States for almost three weeks

531
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm feeling very American

532
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,720
And you know what it really doesn't matter

533
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
The great thing about biodiesel

534
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,720
First of all is that you can make this in your garage

535
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,720
And if you can't find a place to get any

536
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
You can just go to the diesel pump and fill it up

537
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
You know so as it starts to roll out

538
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,720
There's plenty of

539
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
You know there's just no problem

540
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
You can continue to drive as long as you have a diesel

541
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
So

542
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,720
What I'm noticing from all the email and the feedback that I'm getting

543
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
About the biodiesel topic is that

544
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,720
You know it doesn't matter what the media says

545
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Or doesn't say what the president says

546
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
Or doesn't say what the real company say

547
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Or doesn't say

548
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Americans take matters into their own hands

549
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
And I'm seeing that more and more

550
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
The big thing out here of course is electric cars

551
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,720
The price I guess is the big electric car that everyone's driving

552
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,720
And it's you know it's not sexy

553
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
It's kind of ugly

554
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Although I must say American cars these days are getting pretty cute

555
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
A little middle to risk the car in there

556
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
But they're getting pretty good looking

557
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
There's some design coming back into US cars

558
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Ronald and I were talking about that just yesterday

559
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,720
So US car design and a nice diesel engine

560
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,720
And you know the groovy part is

561
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Is that there's enough information out there

562
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
And you can basically just throw anything you want

563
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
Into these diesel engines

564
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
You can have to experiment and get the right mix

565
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
And figure out where you're going to get your vegetable oil

566
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
From

567
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Think about vegetable oil though

568
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
How cool is that you can just throw that into your tank

569
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Doesn't have to come out of the ground

570
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,720
We can grow our own you can grow your own fuel

571
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,720
That may not be easy to grow enough

572
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
For your whole block

573
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
But

574
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
I just see all the benefits there

575
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
And I think it's just going to take a couple of years

576
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Worth of experimentation

577
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
But we'll get there

578
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,720
And that's what's so great about the American public

579
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
You know it's

580
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Hey you know if we see an opportunity we go off we grab it

581
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
And we run with it

582
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
And that's what's happening in fact

583
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
I've received at least four or five different pointers

584
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
To a wide article

585
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Which I'm sure will show up in the show notes

586
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Wiki for today

587
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Is that the green berets

588
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Have been using biodiesel for quite a while

589
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Now they use a mixture of I think 20% biodiesel and 80% regular diesel

590
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,720
But they use about six or seven million gallons a year

591
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
of pooping your tank

592
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,720
So you know and I don't know if that was sanctioned

593
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Or how they started using that

594
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,720
But it's there this stuff really does work

595
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
It's phenomenal

596
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm a little bit bummed

597
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
Because today is the 28th of September

598
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Typically around this time each year

599
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
There's a

600
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
I think that goes on in the Netherlands

601
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Called

602
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Well it's the feast for peace

603
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
And it's for war child

604
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,720
I don't know if you've ever heard of the war child organization

605
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,720
But I think they're pretty pretty am good

606
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Their main concern is children

607
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Who are in

608
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Who of course are always harp as hit by wars

609
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,720
And there are millions of children

610
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Effected by wars around the world

611
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
And war child

612
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,360
you can expect, tries to help these kids.

613
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,280
And they really do a lot of hands-on work.

614
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,400
So the feast for peace evening is essentially

615
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,200
a number of parties throughout the Netherlands.

616
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,640
It may be international, I'm pretty sure, about the Netherlands.

617
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,120
Where people basically raise money for war child.

618
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,560
And last year, I was the year before.

619
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,760
And I was last year.

620
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,920
I was a member of a team of celebs who were serving dinners,

621
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,760
sort of like 300 plates worth of food.

622
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,200
I think it's, I don't know, over 300.

623
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,480
It's your felt like 300.

624
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,680
And a very different of my friend of mine,

625
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,600
a Dull of the Nucker, puts that together to a restaurant.

626
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,480
And this year, the plan was, for me,

627
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,160
to do helicopter rides and charge people like an arm and a leg

628
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,280
to do with a little quick tour in the helicopter.

629
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,960
And of course, they would pass that money off to war child.

630
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,440
But seeing is that I'm here, it's just that I actually

631
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,720
looked at ways to have to be back here on the 30th and Friday.

632
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,400
I was looking at ways to actually go back, do the thing.

633
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,120
Get the helicopter, do the tours, do the dinner,

634
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
then fly back the next day, I was just no way.

635
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,840
I could almost make it, but not really,

636
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,280
because I have to be in San Francisco on the 10th.

637
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,400
So I will, I'll make it up by sending money.

638
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,440
But it's a lot more fun to really see people enjoy themselves

639
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,840
and gladly give up their cash.

640
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
So a little bit bummed about that.

641
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,160
But check out War Child, very good organization.

642
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,560
If you're planning on donating any money to anything this year,

643
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,760
then let it be War Child.

644
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,680
This is the Daily Source Code.

645
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,960
As I said, it's Wednesday, the 28th of September.

646
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,520
I'm kind of ready to go home.

647
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,360
I'm about to go home.

648
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,160
I'm Charles Watson.

649
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm a predictionary.com.

650
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,880
My word a day podcast delivered a daily dose

651
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,680
of English etymology.

652
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,600
After rooting around a dictionary for years,

653
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,360
I've come up with a long list of words

654
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,040
with surprising histories.

655
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,160
Each day, I talked for just a minute or two,

656
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,200
about a word that you thought you already knew.

657
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
For example, on September 2nd, I talked about gossip.

658
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,880
I thought in God's sib was quite literal.

659
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,440
And as in our word sibling, the sib meant relative.

660
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,480
So the God's sib meant relative in God.

661
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,040
So someone who's a gossip,

662
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,280
or someone who came to sponsor a child at their baptism,

663
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,480
a Godfather or a Godmother,

664
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,760
as a gossip quickly lost its gender.

665
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480
The root from such a spiritual family friend,

666
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,200
to the exasperating cow, who's always telling tales

667
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,840
behind her back, was really quite a simple one.

668
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,880
A God parent is obviously a dear friend.

669
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, I'm back in June, and I talked about honest,

670
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,120
at eccentric.

671
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,000
I've heard today is honest.

672
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,800
When I married my wife, I made her an honest woman.

673
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,200
Just that means she was dishonest before.

674
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,400
Usually these days, people think of an honest woman.

675
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,440
It hasn't said that rich people can be eccentric

676
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,080
when the poor are merely crazy,

677
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,840
and this was certainly true of concrete.

678
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
There you go.

679
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,120
I have fun at predictionary,

680
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,680

00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,880
POD-Diver Radio is all about hardcore scuba diving.

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,560
We cover the technical aspects of tech diving.

Equipment reviews, gear configuration, and what's new.

695
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,360
We interact with experts in the fields

696
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,640
of cave exploration, hyperbaric science,

697
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,440
military diving, and underwater archeology.

698
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,160

charge a rebrie there, and set your dive computer.

705
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,160
Get ready to dive deep, get the POD-Diver Radio.

706
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,440
Let's scuba cast on your host, Joe Kocosa.

707
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,640
I really like water.

708
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,640
I like water, I like being underwater,

709
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,880
but it has to be an instrument pool.

710
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,280
I'm not the man for the ocean.

711
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,080
I went diving once.

712
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
It was fine, you know.

713
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,920
It was one of those vacation deals, you know.

714
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Where you get the patty, quick license thing,

715
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,840
train for an hour in the pool, and they take out there.

716
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,120
It was Jamaica, it was a round hill,

717
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,840
which we talked about yesterday.

718
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,480
So you just both only go, like, I don't know,

719
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,720
20 feet, your first dive.

720
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,200
I'm sure we were at 60 or 70, I don't know.

721
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,920
I didn't feel like it was very well regulated.

722
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,360
But I just, I don't dig all the shit

723
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,040
that's in the sea, man, if I, I don't know.

724
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,200
It freaks me out.

725
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,040
Did you see that picture?

726
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,080
Was it the Japanese scientists

727
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,120
who, some of the incredible depth

728
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,680
that like two and a half thousand feet or something?

729
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,480
They took pictures, like five or 600 pictures

730
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,440
of a giant squid, you know, with tentacles

731
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,920
that were 25 feet long, that's the reason I'm not

732
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,520
going to go in the ocean, okay?

733
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,280
How many times have I gone in the ocean?

734
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,640
I stepped on something, you know.

735
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, it's freaks me out.

736
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
But a great podcast nonetheless.

737
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
Paddyver, got to love it.

738
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,000
Hey, there's a new book out.

739
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
When podcasting really started to break,

740
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,880
say, let's say around nine months ago,

741
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,840
less than a year ago, when, yeah, January, I'd say.

742
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,320
There were, I kid you not.

743
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,200
Maybe, I'm going to try and be as realistic as possible.

744
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,920
20, at least 25 requests to write a book.

745
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,840
I've written some pieces of books before,

746
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,000
help people out.

747
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,360
There's no money in books unless you're writing Harry Potter,

748
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,600
but there really is almost no money in it.

749
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,400
But it's cool, you know, it's nice to have a book

750
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,040
that has your name in the bookshelf.

751
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,480
And of course, you'll make some money

752
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,080
in, it's a very enriching experience.

753
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,240
But the publishing world is, who's pretty messed up.

754
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,200
And it's very hard.

755
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah, as I said, you know, there's only a few books

756
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,200
that make a lot of money.

757
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,360
And I basically declined every single offer

758
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,200
to write a book.

759
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,520
I had no time for that and I find incredibly stressful.

760
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,080
I've also been asked to write many, many forwards for books.

761
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,040
I did one, and it was right in the beginning.

762
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,440
It was the first guy who asked,

763
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,040
and probably the only guy I would say yes to.

764
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,200
I have a copy right here.

765
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,960
And that was the first piece of mail that showed up here

766
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,520
at the Curri condo, was two copies of the book podcast

767
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,960
solutions, the complete guide to podcasting.

768
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,040
Written by Mr. Real Reviews, Michael Gohagan,

769
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,480
and Dan Klaus, and it says class, I guess,

770
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,760
and says you're forward by Adam Curry,

771
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,640
has a CD, a sampler in there, was it saying,

772
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,520
includes a CD with all the software you'll need

773
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,280
to start podcasting, it also includes cast blaster

774
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,360
on the CD we were able to get an earlier version in there.

775
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,120
Great book, we should check it out.

776
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,360
What I like is, the layout is really nice,

777
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,640
and they use all Macintosh OS X screenshots,

778
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,360
and that did it for me.

779
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,400
Oh no, I'm sorry, that's not true,

780
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,640
I see some windows screenshots in here as well.

781
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,320
So it really explains a lot about some of the history,

782
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,800
and which I deemed to be pretty damn correct.

783
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,000
It's got information about podsafe music,

784
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,040
it's, of course, this stuff that's happened,

785
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,760
I mean, the podsafe music network,

786
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,080
I don't think was even around

787
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,880
when this book went to print, let me see pod, pod casting,

788
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,320
let me see if podsafe is in here, pod, rolls, podsafe,

789
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,360
45, hold on, let's see what, that's interesting, hold on.

790
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,080
Bear with me, I'm gonna read this book for you.

791
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,360
Using music legally, podssafe, okay, yeah, so there's,

792
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,000
oh, that's good, they have a,

793
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
they interviewed Brian Abbott of Coverville,

794
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,480
and so he has some pretty good insights on that,

795
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,400
since he, he's talked to RIA, sound exchange,

796
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,560
Harry Fox, Askab, be a my cool.

797
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,560
So podcas solutions, definitely a book to check out

798
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,800
if you want to buy a book on pod casting,

799
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
that's the one I would recommend.

800
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,640
I got paid nothing for the forward was happy to do it,

801
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,640
and wish Mike and Dan lots of success with it.

802
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,200
Alrighty, I've been trying to get this backtracked podcast

803
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,880
on the air for weeks, for some reason,

804
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,960
either got uploaded, corrupted during upload or download,

805
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,480
and Aaron, who travels quite a bit back and forth to Asia,

806
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,840
resented to me twice, and now finally, today,

807
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,520
we have backtracked podcast number eight.

808
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,160
Backtracked podcast, so you think you know

809
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,800
your hits backwards and forwards?

810
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,480
Oh yeah, I'm arrogant enough.

811
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,880
Yeah, right.

812
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,680
You're listening to the backtracked podcast exclusively

813
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,360
on the daily source code with Adam Curry.

814
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,200
Hey, Adam.

815
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,280
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

816
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,080
Let's get right into this week's quiz.

817
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,920
Okay, I'm ready.

818
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,760
I'm ready.

819
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,580
Are you ready?

820
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,400
I'm ready.

821
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,520
Okay, here we go.

822
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,000
A-C-A.

823
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Number one.

824
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,760
A-C-A.

825
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,800
A-C-A.

826
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,520
A-C-A.

827
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,320
A-C-A.

828
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,960
A-C-A.

829
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,920
A-C-A.

830
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,200
A-C-A.

831
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,000
A-C-A.

832
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,360
A-C-A.

833
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
A-C-A.

834
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
A-C-A.

835
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
A-C-A.

836
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
A-C-A.

837
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,720
It sounded like Abba.

838
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,360
A-C-A-C.

839
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
A-C-A.

840
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
A-C-A.

841
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,880
A-C-A.

842
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,720
A-C-A.

843
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
A-C-A.

844
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,920
I know it.

845
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,720
Same for the same forward as backwards.

846
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,320
Let's go all the way.

847
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,720
That's a sli-fox.

848
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
One-hit wonder.

849
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Sure.

850
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,320
A-C-A.

851
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,720
A-C-A.

852
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Number three.

853
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
A-C-A.

854
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
A-C-A.

855
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
A-C-A.

856
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
A-C-A.

857
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
A-C-A.

858
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
A-C-A.

859
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
A-C-A.

860
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
A-C-A.

861
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Who is that?

862
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
A-C-A.

863
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,720
A-C-A.

864
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
A-C-A.

865
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
A-C-A.

866
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,520
A-C-A.

867
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Okay, here are the answers.

868
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Number one.

869
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
Here.

870
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Here.

871
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
Oh, you can hear it already.

872
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Here.

873
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520

878
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
A-C-A.

879
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Take a chance on me.

880
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
There's all me.

881
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Cool.

882
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
And here's number two.

883
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
A-C-A.

884
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
A-C-A.

885
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
A-C-A.

888
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
A-C-A.

889
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
A-C-A.

890
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
A-C-A.

891
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
A-C-A.

892
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Oh yeah,

893
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,520
the cane, the cane.

894
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Let's go, all the way.

895
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Let's go all the way.

896
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Number three.

897
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,520
Yeah okay, OK okay.

898
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,520
I gotta follow시다 right.

899
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
A-C-A.

900
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
A-C-A.

901
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
A-C-A.

902
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
A-C-A.

903
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
A-C-A.

904
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,520
So, how did you do Adam?

905
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Three out of three, my friend.

906
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,020
Thanks for joining us on this week's Backtracks podcast quiz.

907
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,520
You can visit Backtracks podcast on the web at Backtrackspodcast.com.

908
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
Catch you next time.

909
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
Backtracks podcast.

910
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
Spin it back.

911
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,520
And I'm quite sure someone will put the iTunes links to those songs

912
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,520
into the Wikinode Sport today's program so you can go order them.

913
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
I don't know about the Abba one.

914
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Man, I used to my sister used to be huge Abba fan.

915
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,520
And of course, I was way too cool, although I can sing every single song.

916
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,520
I was way too cool to be a part of the Abba club.

917
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,520
I was in the punk and scan, selector and madness.

918
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Hey, the Safeway arrived yesterday.

919
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,520
I remember the delivery time was supposed to be between 4 and 6 p.m.

920
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,520
quarter to 6, doorbell rang, right up here at the apartment.

921
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,520
I came in with a little hub, a little truck, what do you call it?

922
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
The hell do you call those things?

923
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
A little cart.

924
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Okay, let's leave it at that.

925
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
I had all my stuff on there.

926
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Nice little checklist.

927
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:57,520
And as he was unpacking stuff, I noticed that you got to be careful

928
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,520
when you're ordering online at Safeway because the pictures are not always,

929
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,520
well, you know, some objects may actually be larger than they appear in the picture.

930
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,520
And some then again may appear a little bit smaller.

931
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,520
Let me explain what I mean.

932
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,520
And I guess I should be looking at sizes now.

933
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,520
So I ordered some paper bowls and some more paper plates because, of course, you know,

934
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,520
JC Penny, hopefully they'll show up tomorrow.

935
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,520
We actually have the real plates and the real silverware.

936
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
So I've been kind of camping out here.

937
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
And I thought, oh, I'll get some cereal.

938
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
I got some, uh, uh, Cheerio.

939
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Honey, not Cheerios.

940
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,520
Not in honey.

941
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
What was it?

942
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Not in honey.

943
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,520
I said, well, I need a bowl to eat them out of.

944
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
So I ordered bowls and I thought this would be like big bowls.

945
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,520
So the time is little like, you know, you would probably hardly even put your peanuts

946
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
in these bowls.

947
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
So that was a mistake.

948
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
But the big mistake, I got to get this thing.

949
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
You won't believe it.

950
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Hold on.

951
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
I've got to read the mentions.

952
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,520
So I like, uh, sometimes at nine, I just want to have peanut butter.

953
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,520
You know, peanut butter and jelly and I really, I really love the peanut butter.

954
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,520
And there's nothing better than skipy, smooth, creamy peanut butter.

955
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,520
The jar that showed up is fucking industrial strength.

956
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,520
This is four pounds of peanut butter.

957
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,520
It didn't look that way.

958
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
And I thought it was expensive.

959
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
I thought, wow, man, eight bucks.

960
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,520
They really charge a premium for skipping peanut butter.

961
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
Well, I think that this will last me.

962
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,520
Well, probably throughout the next five years,

963
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,520
kind of is 1.8 kilos of peanut butter.

964
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
Scaramishes.

965
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,520
That's what did the laundry.

966
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Oh, yeah.

967
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,520
I can you believe it that it's just me and only my clothes.

968
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,520
And this morning, I, uh, I did the socks on the couch here.

969
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,520
And like to wound up with two socks that were different.

970
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
Where did these fuckers go?

971
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,520
Are they walking out of the apartment?

972
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,520
He's Natalie Brown.

973
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:14,520
Even though we said goodbye, quite some time ago,

974
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:22,520
there's a strain of loving my heart.

975
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Let just you let you go.

976
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:39,520
It seems that even when I go to see images of you,

977
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,520
my mind's still clear.

978
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:49,520
I still see you in my dreams.

979
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:56,520
No matter how I try it seems,

980
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:03,520
that a deep part of me just can't forget

981
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,520
that a big part of me still has regrets.

982
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:19,520
And I can't seem to let all the love I had for you go.

983
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Yes, I still see you in my dreams.

984
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:43,520
Sometimes I wait with your face in my mind somehow.

985
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:54,520
I thought that I'd left those memories behind.

986
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:01,520
It seems that you have left my heart frustrated

987
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,520
with vivid memories, your smile created.

988
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:14,520
I still see you in my dream.

989
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:22,520
No matter how I try it seems,

990
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:29,520
that a deep part of me just can't forget

991
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,520
that a big part of me still has regrets.

992
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:45,520
And I can't seem to let all the love I had for you go.

993
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:52,520
I still see you in my dreams.

994
00:46:52,520 --> 00:47:00,520
Yes, I still see you in my dream.

995
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Okay, Mariah Carey, you can take...

996
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,520
You can take your cell, you light and go home now.

997
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,520
Natalie Brown will gladly take your spot.

998
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,520
In my dreams from the Podsake Music Network,

999
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
it is Podsake here on the Daily Source Code.

1000
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,520
Podsake Music Network can be found at music.podshow.com

1001
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,520
and according to her bio page on PMN, which is what we call it at the Back at HQPMN.

1002
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,520
She has a 4.5 Octa Vocal Range, that's unbelievable.

1003
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,520
She's like four songs up there so you can check out the tracks

1004
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,520
and track out check out her vocal range.

1005
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,520
Okay, it is now 10.40 Pacific Standard Time.

1006
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,520
I'm going to get my butt over to the office, get these shows uploaded.

1007
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,520
I guess I'll start off today and we'll wait for the wiki notes to start appearing

1008
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,520
once there's kind of a run down, then I'll post it into the podcast feed

1009
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,520
so that everyone who's using an aggregator will be able to get it with the show notes

1010
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,520
included and I'll just do a quick copy paste and a link back to the original

1011
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,520
to the wiki notes so that the notes can grow.

1012
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
Because that's basically what it is.

1013
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,520
We just need to get it started off and then it'll be a place where information can grow

1014
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,520
and prosper.

1015
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,520
And please, instead of sending me email in response to stuff like the bio diesel

1016
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,520
or the EVDO card or the Wi-Fi ideas, just post it on the wiki.

1017
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,520
There's places now, there's user comments and feedback.

1018
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,520
You could actually put links in on the segments where we talked about some of these things.

1019
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,520
And that's it.

1020
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Two more shows.

1021
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,520
Then I'm home.

1022
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,520
