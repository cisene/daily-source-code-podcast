1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
content in my ears.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,840
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Delta Sierra Charlie 305 Tuesday December 27, 2005

5
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,340
Can't do a value with the evidence on a close case, high-class, high-class, high-class,

6
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,840
potential in a place against the clock.

7
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,840
You look like you could use a bricks to set as I lift my head, and I'm a looking from a danger.

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Not sure how long I would talk for looking for the girl thought I saw her on the show, but when I looked together

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,840
I felt I had been mistaken looking in the wrong direction, I can question tape it close to the answer.

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,840
I can't a chance because when I hit the walls, I'm the back to send me up for the bowl of lunch.

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,840
I went somewhere to go.

12
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,840
I know I'd rather stay.

13
00:01:32,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Mix it up, mix it up, stir it in a cup, turn it up, mix it up, mix it up, stir it in a cup, turn it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, mix it up

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:32,740
all just up with somewhere to go but I know I'd rather stay in, in search of a truth that lasts

15
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Forever better stay at the end

16
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,740
Forever better stay at the end

17
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:18,740
Forever better stay at the end

18
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:27,740
Forever better stay at the end

19
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:34,740
Forever better stay at the end

20
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:46,740
Forever better stay at the end

21
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Forever better stay at the end

22
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:48,020
What does it remind you of?

23
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:56,020
It's a couple of things in there that don't know if they get some Michael Frank's, I guess.

24
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:04,020
We should really check out the influences on all of the time, let's do that now.

25
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,020
Sound scientist, that's Phil, from the potsafe music network.

26
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,020
We want to find more out about sound scientist and hop on over to the show notes.

27
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Let me go there right now, let me tell you who their influences are.

28
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Because that's one of the things you're supposed to listen to your profile.

29
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,020
Hold on a second, let me see.

30
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,020
Let me go to my playlist.

31
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Sorry, not only a little bit better prepared than this.

32
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,020
Oh, my goodness.

33
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,020
You know that this thing has been on the potsafe music network for a long time.

34
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,020
In fact, so long that it's like at page number 7 of my playlist.

35
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,020
Let me see if this is it.

36
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,020
Here we go.

37
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
Sound scientist.

38
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
Sound scientist.

39
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Come on.

40
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,020
Why don't I?

41
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,020
There we go.

42
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,020
Click on the link.

43
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,020
I July 19th, 2005, my goodness.

44
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
That's when I added it.

45
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,020
I haven't played it since then.

46
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,020
Okay.

47
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,020
Influences, Queen, Stevie Wonder, Old Weasers, Chopin, and Radiohead.

48
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
Okay.

49
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,020
If it's everybody, hope you had a great Christmas.

50
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,020
If you're celebrating Hanukkah, happy Hanukkah.

51
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,020
This is your daily source code, kind of a laid-back version today.

52
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,020
I have some things prepped and prepared and some stuff to talk about.

53
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
But I've kind of been keeping it loose.

54
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Oh, man, it's so nice.

55
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Just, you know, take three days off.

56
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,020
You know, it didn't do a show yesterday, which, of course, was in Europe.

57
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
It was the second day.

58
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Well, it was everywhere.

59
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,020
It was the day after Christmas.

60
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,020
But in Europe, they usually celebrate two days of Christmas.

61
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,020
So you had the first day in the second day, both are holidays.

62
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,020
In the UK, they have something called Boxing Day, which I still don't really understand.

63
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,020
I'm not quite sure.

64
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,020
What, when you're supposed to give gifts, is that on the 25th and what do you do on Boxing Day?

65
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,020
One thing seems to be very similar between the, you know, Kingdom and the United States.

66
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,020
And that's the, a massive amount of shopping that I do on the day after Christmas.

67
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,020
Wow, all the newspapers are just full of it.

68
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
And we almost had a white Christmas.

69
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Today it's snowed.

70
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,020
Some big, nice, white snowflakes.

71
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
So two days late, but we came very close.

72
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:14,020
So it's interesting because I've become kind of the weathermen of my, of my direct environment.

73
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,020
People are always asking me what the weather's going to be like.

74
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,020
And the reason why I realized actually I realized it last night when I said,

75
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Oh, snow's coming tomorrow is because I'm usually right.

76
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,020
And why am I usually right?

77
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,020
And this is maybe this is not a big, oh, wow thing for people who are into weather.

78
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,020
And I know there's huge communities about weather on the internet.

79
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,020
I mean, weather and if you could really predict the weather accurately.

80
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,020
Oh my gosh, would you be the most powerful man in the universe or what?

81
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:50,020
The reason why my weather reports are pretty accurate is because I get my weather reports from aviation.

82
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:56,020
And the way it's done is through Maytars metro area.

83
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,020
What actually does Maytars town stand for?

84
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,020
That meteorological meteorological report for area.

85
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,020
I should know this shit. Well, then you have the tough, which is the terminal area forecast.

86
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:19,020
So basically, if you combine those two pieces of information and it's written in this amazing code that is actually a part of your,

87
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,020
and you know, part of your, your training as a pilot.

88
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,020
Let me see, I'll give you an example of some code for today, all right.

89
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,020
And I'm going to do it for London Heathrow.

90
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,020
Hold on a second.

91
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,020
You can look this stuff up almost anywhere on the internet.

92
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,020
So London Heathrow, I know, is EGLL.

93
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
That's the code.

94
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,020
And here we go.

95
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Okay, so if I were to read the, the actual tap and Maytars, it would sound something like this.

96
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:17,020
270315Z space 270413 space 36010 KT space 9999 space FEW 014 space SCT 018 space PROB 40 space TMPO space O40.

97
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,020
I can just keep on going.

98
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:28,020
And there's more than there's minus SHSN space BKN 010 space PROB 30 space TEMPO.

99
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:35,020
So it's this incredible code, which if I were to translate it, let me see if I can do this for you.

100
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,020
I'm going to translate one of these lines of code.

101
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,020
This would be the long terminal area forecast for London.

102
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,020
So it's issued on the 27th at 1036 UTC.

103
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:55,020
Valid from 1800 UTC on the 27th at December until 12 noon UTC on the 28th.

104
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Wind 10 degrees at 7 knots visibility 10 kilometers or more scattered clouds at 1800 feet.

105
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:11,020
So this is important stuff for pilot and really what I like about this weather is you're getting it from people who are in that real area.

106
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,020
Not just on the ground, but also reports from pilots in the sky.

107
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,020
So you do have a three-dimensional kind of view.

108
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:25,020
Temporarily from 1800 to 2100 visibility would be 5,000 meters light showers and snow broken cloud at 1,000 feet.

109
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:32,020
So there's a reason to maybe not go flying if you don't have an instrument rating.

110
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,020
We'll build the 30% temporarily between 1800 and 2000 visibility will be 2,500 meters.

111
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,020
So now we're really starting to close in showers and snow broken cloud at 700 feet.

112
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:50,020
So that's really where you're going to have some problems if you don't have instruments broken cloud at 1,500 feet.

113
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:59,020
And then the Omni is CB, which stands for Kamila Nimbus, which means badass thunder storm clouds.

114
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,020
Don't want to be in those clouds. So this is how I get my weather information.

115
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,020
So I can basically say, hey, you know, what it looks like showers, snow, it's going to be overcast.

116
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,020
And you know, I can give a probably about 30% that that'll happen.

117
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,020
And it's usually right because aviators depend so much on the weather.

118
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,020
And not just for bad weather, but you need to know where the wind's coming from.

119
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,020
What's, look, it's an element that you're dealing with is like, you know,

120
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,020
the road and weather conditions in the air. It's weather conditions.

121
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,020
So it really does work. And I'm, I hunted around a little bit to see if people are doing anything.

122
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:41,020
Really with weather forecasting based upon this information, which is accessible just about anyway.

123
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,020
As far as I know, it's completely freely available information worldwide.

124
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:53,020
And as long as you know what airports to look for, or you have a system that can look that up and get you the closest airport information,

125
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,020
you're going to be pretty good with your weather forecasting.

126
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:02,020
So anyway, we could start, I guess we could start a whole huge threat about weather here on the daily source code.

127
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,020
But I've gotten into it. I really have.

128
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,020
I actually saw someone wrote some pearl script that'll decode these codes.

129
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:15,020
It seems like a great programming project, by the way, if you're, you know, because the codes are all standardized.

130
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,020
Excuse me. Oh, my goodness.

131
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,020
It's a double shot of sincere, everybody.

132
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,020
Andrew Klein wrote me emails because I live in Brooklyn, New York and work in Jersey.

133
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,020
So needless to say, I've been driving people to work because of our transit strike.

134
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Anyway, although the strike was over Friday morning, my wife still decided to go in early, so she could do some last minute,

135
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Christmas shopping. I was okay with driving her, but needed to leave earlier the normal and warrant her of this.

136
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,020
Of course, the ensuing argument about my impatience got a little testy if not for the heater in the car,

137
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,020
the frostiness between us would have been unbearable.

138
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,020
That is, until you mentioned leaving late to go visit your mom and how living with two women,

139
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,020
you should figure it to have at least 30 minutes to be late when leaving with them.

140
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:05,020
We both started laughing and as the heater in the car had already kicked in, the last of the frostiness between us disappeared.

141
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
Thanks Adam for helping out with my marriage.

142
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,020
All a part of the public service that Delta shared a Charlie tries to offer you.

143
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:18,020
Got an email from my dad. He says he's okay. He has some new year's resolutions.

144
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,020
No smoking, no drinking, no more exercise.

145
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,020
And it was very nice of a couple of people who sent in and explained what a Tia is.

146
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Dr. Katz who we've spoken to before chief of cardiac surgery in the Virginia Transplant Center.

147
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,020
Enrichment for genius art here by your parents' health problems.

148
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,020
If some information is to clarify what a Tia or transient ischemic attack is about.

149
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,020
Basically, a mini stroke usually occurs from a small clot or piece of cholesterol like debris traveling to,

150
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,020
and temporarily occluding a small blood vessel in the brain.

151
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,020
I'm going to scratch my head and then talk about that shit.

152
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Fortunately, by definition, a Tia lasts only a very short period of time and then totally resolves.

153
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Unfortunately, it is many times a predecessor of things to come.

154
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,020
And he sent me a link to the American Heart Association, AmericanHeart.org.

155
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,020
They have another one here.

156
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,020
William Pachal, not basically sent the same thing.

157
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,020
But the cool thing was, is that the way my dad sent the email,

158
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,020
and I told you that we don't really talk.

159
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,020
He said, oh, I happen to listen to DSC.

160
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,020
If you call it DSC, you don't just happen to listen to it.

161
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,020
It gives me a whole other perspective on the audience.

162
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,020
And Paul Nichols, bless his heart.

163
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,020
Good old podcast Paul.

164
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,020
He heard my call.

165
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,020
I wanted more cowbell, and I wanted some drum cadence.

166
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,020
And he sent me both in one nice little meat package. Thanks, buddy.

167
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,020
One, two, three, four.

168
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Matthew Ebal.

169
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Matthew Ebal. He's got a new CD coming out.

170
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
I'm really looking forward to it. It's called Bearing Coffee.

171
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
I know it's that it sounds great.

172
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
Very catchy, a lot of fun.

173
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,020
So I can't wait to hear the new one, Matthew, very cool.

174
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
Check out the website.

175
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,020
He's got this really cool, copy, folk rock going on.

176
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,020
Reminds me a lot of people like Jason Mirazz and how he day, who I adore, I think they're great.

177
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
I am really looking forward to that CD.

178
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
We're going to rip this podcast.

179
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,020
To this, the question, who is Matthew Ebal?

180
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Now, live from the accident, hash headquarters in Metro West Boston.

181
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,020
Here's your host, CC Chapman.

182
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,020
Good Thursday, it is episode 133 of the financial aid podcast.

183
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
My name is Chris Panwalk, I'm a new Chris.

184
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,020
Daily.

185
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Counting down the top ten podcasting tunes, being spun by podcasters.

186
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,020
podcasting, it's battle curry.

187
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Almost live from the cottage at the 5th, safe music Tuesday.

188
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Matthew Ebal on the daily source code.

189
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,020
She's a really solid, fun tune.

190
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
He has such a good voice, really does.

191
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,020
And what's great about Matthew is that he just had the urge to chase his dream.

192
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,020
One day, through everything the back is you haul, hooked it up to his car, grow from Washington state.

193
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
All in the national Tennessee.

194
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,020
Let's roll out some tunes.

195
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:44,020
This is, of course, you've probably heard this several times on the daily source code.

196
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
By now, you should know Matthew Ebal, right?

197
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,020
It was the time when nothing stood in between us.

198
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Now there's a girl in the world so sharp, it'll make you bleed.

199
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:05,020
We don't talk, we just punch the clock and find each other in the same old rhythm that may be a little escape.

200
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,020
What we need.

201
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,020
We love and you work like a dog every morning.

202
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,020
The city's a pain like the latte's stain on your dress.

203
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Hit in the bay and before you break down,

204
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,020
I don't cost the damn to leave this town.

205
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,020
But you don't know because we got to get out of this mess.

206
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:35,020
So let's drive away.

207
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

208
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,020
Now nothing gonna stay in a way.

209
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:52,020
Let's drive away.

210
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

211
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

212
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

213
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

214
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

215
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

216
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,020
Let the light chase us all day.

217
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

218
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

219
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

220
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

221
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

222
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

223
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,020
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

224
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm sorry if I seemed fast but I gotta get going

225
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:21,020
Just gotta be more than the coffee shops in the barn

226
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Baby, baby, it's still late

227
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,020
Baby, baby, it's just late

228
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Baby, you take my hand, we'll get in the car

229
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,020
One, one, one, two, let's drive away

230
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,020
And some nice Jason's all day

231
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,020
Baby, that's all I got to say

232
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Baby, it's right

233
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
We'll drive away

234
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,020
Baby, you take my hand, we'll get in the car

235
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,020
One, two, let's drive away

236
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,020
Matthew Ebel

237
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,020
I've said it before, I'll say again

238
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,020
Top down, driving around music from Matthew Ebel

239
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,020
Drive away on your daily source code for this Tuesday

240
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,020
Yeah, drive away has spent two weeks at number one

241
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,020
An amazing 13 weeks in the countdown

242
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm telling you Matthew Ebel really knows how to promote himself

243
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,020
That match came in, I'm like, yeah, perfect, I'll play that

244
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,020
That's awesome, very, very cool, Matthew Ebel completely dedicated his life

245
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
to being an independent musician

246
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,020
And I wish him, of course, a great 2006

247
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,020
I don't mind quite sure about shows for the rest of the week

248
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,020
or actually rested the year

249
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Because I'm kind of waiting for the weather to give us a nice day

250
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,020
The wind commander called me up just before Christmas

251
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,020
He said, dude, I've got two squared tires

252
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,020
This is from my night landing at Farrox

253
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
But he was pissed

254
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,020
And he's really just pissed, he's like, man, that's 200 euros dude

255
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,020
For your tires, don't do that

256
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,020
They did their job, of course, they did stop me

257
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
So he's like, okay, listen, the minute the weather clears

258
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,020
I'm coming out, we're doing a whole bunch of night landings

259
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,020
To Antwerp Airport, we can do it until 8 o'clock at night

260
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
And I'm going to come pick you up

261
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
So that's actually how I got to the whole weather thing

262
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,020
With the snow and everything last night

263
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,020
Because we said, we knew last night that it wasn't going to happen today

264
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,020
When it does happen though, which could easily be tomorrow

265
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,020
And I won't know until around 7 p.m. because that's when the new

266
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,020
Terminal area of forecast come out

267
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,020
And it has to be good weather here and in Belgium, obviously

268
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,020
That's where we do most of our training

269
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,020
And if possible in the middle of the day long

270
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,020
In the Netherlands, because I'd like to drop by and say

271
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,020
Happy holidays to cast Blaster Mike

272
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I think my wonder

273
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,020
But I think he was sending his son off to stay with grandma or something

274
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
But I think he's having some kind of

275
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,020
Romantic week

276
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Good buzzer's house

277
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,020
So anyways, so that could affect the shows for the next couple of days

278
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,020
If we do go, then I'll probably miss one day

279
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,020
Or I'll be late one day, something like that

280
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,020
We'll see what happens, new worries

281
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,020
Let me see what I have here

282
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Oh yeah

283
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,020
Good buddy, comic strip blogger

284
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Has his predictions for 2006

285
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,020
He has some really, really funny, funny predictions

286
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,020
The best one at number three

287
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Adam Curry and his friend Rom Bloom will sell pod show ink for $400 million

288
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
To Yahoo, please

289
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,020
Why go and ruin a good thing?

290
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
I'm having too much fun, man

291
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
This is not built to sell

292
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,020
There's got to be a real reason

293
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,020
I don't see a selling anything to Yahoo

294
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
Man, oh man

295
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
I mean, yes, I'm pretty funny predictions on there

296
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
Check it out at what is it

297
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,020
Blogs.msmobiles.com

298
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,020
Yeah, I'm still presuming that mobile phone fan

299
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,020
Is the same guy as comic strip blogger

300
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
And I was kind of wacky

301
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
Who's Skyping me now?

302
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
Go away

303
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
What was he gonna say?

304
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Something about comic strip blogger

305
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Shit

306
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Oh yeah, I received a Christmas card

307
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
From Jaysek

308
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
And I think that's

309
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,020
I don't know

310
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,020
So is this all three the same guys you have a mobile phone fan

311
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
You've got comic strip blogger

312
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,020
Then you've got Jaysek

313
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,020
And then you've got some guy who says he's Jaysek

314
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
But he isn't or at least CSB says he isn't

315
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
I don't know

316
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,020
But I got a Christmas card from which is

317
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
Very sweet in this concert

318
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
Oh shit

319
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,020
And disconcerting at the same time

320
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,020
How is this tape Marcus ID?

321
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,020
Oh shoot

322
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
I've been forgetting this for a long time

323
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Marcus from the scenes scene

324
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,020
He does all those

325
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,020
All those cool

326
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,020
What do you call him?

327
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
All those cool little pod show IDs

328
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,020
And he asked me to cut him an ID

329
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,020
I'm so stupid

330
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
Hold on a second

331
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,020
Let me see

332
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Marcus

333
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,020
Let me see if I can find his email

334
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,020
He wanted me to read some kind of line or form that he could then use

335
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Um

336
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Let me see

337
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Trade

338
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,020
There you go

339
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,020
Trade me for rewind ID

340
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Let me do this right now

341
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
I hope you don't mind

342
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,020
What doesn't even say

343
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,020
I guess I don't care if anything goes

344
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Okay

345
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
Hey everybody

348
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,020
Well shit

349
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
That was easy

350
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,020

00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
It's a slip of the lamp

367
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
It's a word or a tip

368
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,020
My gosh

369
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
It's a hip

370
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
What's a hip

371
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,020
It's an expression of how you feel about something

372
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,020
It's you

373
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,020
Bursting with verbal exuberance

374
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,020

388
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,020
It's time for our Metrosexual moment

389
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,020
And how many some music for that?

390
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,020
I got Jeff Smith sent me the Trinity stuff

391
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,020
And he did it perfectly now

392
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,020
I've got like eight minutes of day to day

393
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,020
Day to day

394
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,020
So I can talk over it and do the whole biodiesel Trinity thing

395
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
Which we're not going to do today

396
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,020
By the way

397
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,020
I'm saving that for another rainy snowy day

398
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
I've got a lot to talk about though

399
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
But we are going to do our Metrosexual moment

400
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
So I need a Metrosexual moment

401
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,020
Jingle

402
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
Let's talk about razors

403
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,020
We've been on the conversation thread here

404
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
Which razor is the best

405
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,020
Because we're guys

406
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,020
And we're kind of afraid to talk about that

407
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
Anywhere else

408
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,020
But in a synchronous mode

409
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
What is this?

410
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,020
James Dawsey

411
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Or Dawsey said

412
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
Nevermind since say

413
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,020
I'm currently at Tesco

414
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,020
That's a supermarket here in the UK

415
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Find myself paying for an M3 Power Razor

416
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Before I knew what I was doing

417
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
Seriously

418
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,020
I did not realize I had put it in the basket

419
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Shit works

420
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Todd from Jersey on DSC303

421
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Did you say someone is seeking a doopily?

422
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
Geez

423
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,020
Someone call Cousin Brucey quick

424
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
Okay

425
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Also how come there's not been any discussion regarding electric shavers

426
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
Good question

427
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
As a tech head

428
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,020
I thought that you and your listeners would be all sorts of things

429
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Electric

430
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
I'm a Devout Panasonic user

431
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,020
And it cruises quietly every morning in the shower

432
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,020
It gives a much better shave than I've experienced with the blade

433
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,020
And no worrying about slashing myself when I'm brainited in the morning

434
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
So okay, which model Panasonic

435
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,020
And so you're supposed to use that industry

436
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,020
I don't always shower in sync with my with my shaving needs

437
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,020
In fact, I'm a guy who definitely when I'm here at home at the cottage

438
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
I let that shit go

439
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
I really do have not gone anywhere

440
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
And until both Patricia and Christina just say look

441
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
We're not coming near you anymore

442
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
We don't want to kiss you

443
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
You're like a fricking porcupine

444
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
You can forget sex by the way

445
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,020
Or at least anything adventurous

446
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,020
So I'm easily like three to five days

447
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,020
If I feel like it won't manage that

448
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
Give you a shave

449
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,020
But I would like to know more about it

450
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,020
I'm willing to try all this stuff

451
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,020
I actually

452
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
As you recall from the last show

453
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,020
I asked Patricia she was on her way out to Sainsbury

454
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
To buy me the M3 Power Razor

455
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
What an interesting device

456
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,020
And someone at Gillette is laughing that fricking ass off

457
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,020
And in fact, maybe this is the whole reason why they acquired Duracell

458
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,020
Because basically now they've got one device

459
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,020
That has two renewable pieces

460
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
One being the blade

461
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,020
And please don't just put any mock three blade on it

462
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
It has to be one of those green ones

463
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,020
And it comes free package with a triple A Duracell battery

464
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Which Gillette purchased Duracell

465
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
I don't know was it a year ago or two years ago

466
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,020
So those guys don't be fucking loving this

467
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Anyway, so I tried it out

468
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
It's really weird

469
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,020
It's almost like flying by wire in an airplane

470
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Because because of the vibration

471
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,020
And it really vibrates quite heavily

472
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,020
And you're pulling this across your face

473
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,020
It feels like you don't have the pressure control that you normally have

474
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,020
You know how you use your hand pressure

475
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:47,020
So yeah, just make it glide and some spots you may apply more pressure

476
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,020
And I don't know, I'm not too happy

477
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,020
I think that with any new shaving device you use

478
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
You probably have to get used to it in your

479
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
The way that it's working

480
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,020
So immediately I've got like bumps and razor burn

481
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,020
And I'm going to stick with it for another week or so

482
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,020
But I'm not really vibing yet on the M3

483
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Again, it could just be because my face has to get used to it

484
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,020
And I don't really like the loss of pressure control

485
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,020
And I got this really long email from Robert Rottenberg

486
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
And he says, I'll just read some pieces from it

487
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
Most shaving problems arise from beard and skin

488
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Having different levels of moisture

489
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
Good shaving technique can equalize them

490
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
And improve your results regardless of the blade

491
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
As long as the blade doesn't have a naked should do the job

492
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,020
He says he starts with a warm wet face

493
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,020
Now that's how I start all my days

494
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
In fact, I prefer to do this in the shower

495
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,020
To maximize the moisture

496
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,020
God, how metro sexual are we now?

497
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,020
Then I apply about a teaspoon of oil all over my wet beard

498
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,020
This is getting hot, baby

499
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,020
It can be baby oil light olive oil or that special shaving oil

500
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,020
With the aroma of peppermint the cosmetic company sell at

501
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
20 dollars an ounce

502
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
But the oil ensures that the blade will glide over the skin

503
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,020
Without pulling it, interesting

504
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
After the oil is worked in

505
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,020
I apply the first two layers

506
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,020
A ladders of shaving cream or gel

507
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
A brush is nice

508
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
And I use one when I can

509
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,020
But really any foaming cream or gel will do

510
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
The cream or gel saturates the beard

511
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,020
Holding the moisture to absorb

512
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,020
Then I shaved on my beard for my cheekbones

513
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,020
To my atoms, I'll pull in short strokes

514
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,020
Look, look, look, look, look

515
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,020
Removing as much of the shave cream as possible

516
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
I finish shaving my throat

517
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,020
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

518
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Anything else here?

519
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,020
It's interesting

520
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,020
So you think that it's all in the smoothness of the face

521
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,020
Good technique with any razor

522
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,020
It does go into

523
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,020
Oh man, he really

524
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,020
How much time do you spend

525
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,020
Bob Rottenberg from the Munchies podcast?

526
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,020
How much time do you spend shaving?

527
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
Which is another thing

528
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,020
You know, God damn sometimes it's like not convenient

529
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,020
Jim from Cleveland, Ohio

530
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,020
Adam, great show, listening almost a year now

531
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,020
I purchased one of those vibrating gelat razors a while back

532
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
I typically change my blade every couple of weeks

533
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
Anyway, I used this new razor that I got for a long time

534
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,020
At least a month, I think even longer

535
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
So eventually I replaced the blade

536
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,020
And it went back to my two week replacement rotation

537
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,020
So my theory here is that they give you a longer lasting blade

538
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
When you buy the razor to get you hooked

539
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,020
And then the replacement blades you dulled

540
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,020
You buy dull more quickly

541
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,020
Well, that's interesting

542
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
I think that they'll be pretty stupid

543
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
I would certainly consider that if I was gelat

544
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
But it'll be pretty easy to figure out

545
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
I think, is there a way to check the blades

546
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
And see if the one that comes prepaid

547
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,020
Maybe just do a comparison, see if the blade that you bought

548
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,020
Is even a little bit different

549
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,020
There's some kind of marking on it

550
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,020
The shows that it's different from the replacement blades

551
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Who knows

552
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,020
And that concludes the Metrosexual moment

553
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,020
Hello Adam

554
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
Chris from Pennsylvania here

555
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,020
Wanted to give you some audio feedback regarding the comment

556
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,020
You made about the connection that podcasters have with their listeners

557
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,020
Wanted to confirm that you were dead on target

558
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,020
The connection that exists there is a very powerful one

559
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,020
Much more powerful than radio and TV have

560
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,020
And I'll use myself as an example

561
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,020
For instance, the advertising for San Seo on your show

562
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,020
Has convinced me to beg my family for a San Seo for Christmas

563
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,020
I can't wait to get one

564
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,020
And I can't get the freaking thing out of my head

565
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
Because you remind me of it all the time

566
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,020
On the flip side

567
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
I used one in a hotel last month

568
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
And immediately, guess what I thought of you

569
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,020
So the advertising works

570
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,020
And the connection there is very powerful

571
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,020
And there's no advertising that I can recall

572
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,020
Like that that comes from radio and TV

573
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,020
In fact, I never listen to radio anymore

574
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,020
And I don't watch commercials on TV because of TV

575
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,020
So the power is also in the medium

576
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,020
By nature, podcasting is a much more interactive medium

577
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,020
If you want anything

578
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Find out anything on the show

579
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,020
You can just go to the show notes and purchase

580
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Or find more information right away

581
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,020
With TV and radio, the advertisers are just hoping

582
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,020
That they leave an impression on you

583
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
So that who knows how much later

584
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,020
When they go to the grocery store or whatever

585
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,020
You remember their project product

586
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,020
Podcasting is a much more immediate

587
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,020
Much more instant gratification and much more

588
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
Impulsive medium

589
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,020
As well as a hundred times more targetive

590
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
There is much power in that

591
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,020
And I guarantee you that people will pay good money for it

592
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
If not for the so reason

593
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,020
That they will get better returns on their advertising investment

594
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,020
It's not a far cry from digital signage actually

595
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,020
Anyway, love your show has had a huge effect on my life

596
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,020
And I started my own family podcast as a result

597
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,020
Which isn't very good but I'm working on it

598
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
Anyway, thanks for the hard work inspiration

599
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
See you later

600
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
Yo Chris, thanks buddy

601
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
That's very nice of you

602
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,020
You didn't mention what the name of your podcast was

603
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,020
You should have plugged it

604
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,020
Let me know what it was

605
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,020
I couldn't have said that better myself

606
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,020
Obviously

607
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
And it does make

608
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,020
There's a lot of talk about advertising

609
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,020
And we talk about a lot here on source code as well

610
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,020
We have to change advertising

611
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
We really do

612
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,020
Otherwise we've totally failed in our mission

613
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,020
To overcome the man

614
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,020
No, overcome the man

615
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,020
It was holding us down

616
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,020
And I think that just because of

617
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,020
The nature of radio

618
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,020
It's not like anyone was really maliciously

619
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,020
There was any malicious intent on the

620
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
On the part of mainstream radio

621
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,020
But when you only have one frequency per station

622
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,020
There's a limited number of frequencies per market

623
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,020
And there's only so many markets you can be in

624
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,020
And you're limited by time

625
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Because we're not limited by time

626
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
I guess we are

627
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,020
I mean if I were to make a 24 hour podcast

628
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,020
I can only do one every 24 hours

629
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,020
But that obviously

630
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,020
Well, no, that's not true

631
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,020
If I could split myself into

632
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
If I could host one and produce one

633
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
I could, I could do as many as I want

634
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,020
So, you know, it had to really come down to being

635
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
Slice and dice up into

636
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,020
I think but these days it's even 20 second segments

637
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
Is that it?

638
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
Is that what commercials are running for?

639
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,020
They're still doing 30s and 60s

640
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,020
Probably more 30s than anything

641
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Or maybe 20s with a 10 second tag

642
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,020
Because you have to be able to account for

643
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,020
When you're selling stuff based upon time

644
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
That's what they're selling

645
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Airtime

646
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
Airtime

647
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,020
Airtime, advertising space

648
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
Airtime

649
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,020
And there's only so much time in an hour

650
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,020
And there's even legal limits to that

651
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
So, when it comes to

652
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,020
What we're talking about here

653
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,020
And since say it was not a sponsor

654
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,020
I just happened to love the product

655
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
I've talked about it

656
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
With my passion

657
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,020
Same I do about products

658
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,020
That we do get paid for

659
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,020
Let's see like the eye dog or earthlink

660
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,020
Unfortunately we still have to

661
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,020
We're still working on the transition

662
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:49,020
So you hear a traditional 20 second or 30 second earthlink spot

663
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,020
But in actuality it would be very easy for me to tell you about earthlink

664
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,020
Because I've had an account with these guys for

665
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,020
I don't know

666
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,020
Seven years or something like that

667
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,020
I've always had an earthlink dial in account

668
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,020
It's like you can really trust these guys

669
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Because they come from a good place

670
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,020
And that's the kind of commercial that I like doing

671
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
I really do

672
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,020
That's why you remember the Snapple commercials

673
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,020
That Howard Stern did

674
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
You know because he was doing him

675
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,020
And I guess he was paid by a result

676
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,020
Or they certainly weren't splicing it up by time

677
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
Because sometimes he just go on and on

678
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,020
And on with this commercial

679
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
So I think that's really what it is

680
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,020
You know it's it's integrated

681
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
And it works

682
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,020
The question is if I all of a sudden

683
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,020
Start getting paid by Senseo to do that

684
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
Or they would be sponsoring my burps

685
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,020
Which is a great way

686
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
We have limited resources

687
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
We don't have so much gas

688
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
Would you still think it's cool?

689
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,020
Let's see what we got

690
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Almost 40 minutes

691
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,020
Christ

692
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,020
There's so much more I wanted to do

693
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,020
Okay

694
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,020
I'm going to skip over a couple of things

695
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,020
I'm actually moving them down in my outline

696
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
Here we go

697
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
I want to there's a couple of audio pieces

698
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,020
I want to share with you

699
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
J King says

700
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Anna made a mashup if you're talking about mashups

701
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
And revving up Trinity

702
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Hope you enjoy

703
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
I'm a sucker for a mashup any day

704
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
And I'm starting to figure this out

705
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,020
And I really what we're talking about here

706
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Is

707
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
We're mashing up our own media

708
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
And you know we're

709
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
We're mashing up our own media

710
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
Mr. Pooch

711
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
Bitchigan moaning

712
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
Yeah, it's a podcast

713
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
Yeah, it's kind of like radio

714
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,020
But what is it really?

715
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,020
It's going to be figured out

716
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
Yeah, and you know what really is this stuff we're doing

717
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
What we're doing is

718
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
And

719
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Listen to that puppy per

720
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
Come on, let's go look at the engine

721
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,020
Wait, I'll take my camera

722
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
Take some pictures of

723
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
We're taking each other

724
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
Shit, repurposing it and throwing

725
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
Throwing a back at each other

726
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Looks like

727
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,020
It's definitely mashup

728
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,020
I think there's

729
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,020
Somewhere

730
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
There's a thing here

731
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,020
To open up the

732
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
Ah, there she goes

733
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
We're taking

734
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
Audio feedback from each other

735
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Listen to that engine per

736
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,020
Huh?

737
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,020
It's kind of like a junkyard

738
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,020
It's bites and pieces

739
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,020
And

740
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,020
This is running like a charm

741
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,020
Just beautiful

742
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,020
Mainstream media

743
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
That you've been missed and mashed

744
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,020
And mangled

745
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,020
Listen to us

746
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,020
Listen to us

747
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,020
Listen to that engine

748
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,020
Listen to that engine

749
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,020
Podcast

750
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,020
You can hear the turbo

751
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,020
But it's really a mash

752
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
It's a mash of stuff

753
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
Listen to us

754
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
Ah, so sweet

755
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,020
Then I think that we're going to see

756
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,020
All kinds of mashups

757
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,020
We've got to pimp this bitch out

758
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
That's what we've got to do

759
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
It's going to be

760
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
It's going to be big

761
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
A cock-motion cock-do

762
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
I can feel it

763
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,020
I can't feel it

764
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,020
I can't feel it

765
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,020
Cock-motion

766
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,020
But it's great

767
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,020
And cock-do

768
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,020
Cock-off-crap

769
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
How quickly we're able to organize

770
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
And create

771
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,020
Cock-motion

772
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,020
A mashup

773
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,020
There you go

774
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,020
Once again

775
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
You know what the hell was that

776
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
That was a complete mashup

777
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,020
We made entertainment

778
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
ourselves

779
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,020
This is really important stuff

780
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
That's happening here

781
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,020
Ah, I think that

782
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
When the enemies

783
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,020
That's going to be awesome

784
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,020
I'm excited about it

785
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,020
Hey, you can hear the turbo

786
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,020
All right, Jay

787
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,020
Thank you

788
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
It's certainly a mashup of some sort

789
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,020
We are putting our shit together

790
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
Mashup and spin it back at each other

791
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,020
Aren't we?

792
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
All right, to wind it up

793
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
Adam happy holidays

794
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,020
Says Rick Hood

795
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,020
And I'm a sucker for an email

796
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,020
Like this

797
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Uh

798
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,020
The band my son is part of

799
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,020
Blue vagros

800
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,020
As put someone who songs up on the pod

801
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,020
Safe Music Network

802
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,020
I may be biased

803
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,400
But I really think they're quite something, especially for a high school band, as for the

804
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,780
primary song writer is amazing.

805
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,300
Here's Anne Bancroft's dad.

806
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
And I'm traveling.

807
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
She's a kid.

808
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,020
And all my dreams and superstitions,

809
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,020
I've been burning all the back of her.

810
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,020
It's a common little close with her.

811
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,020
Make sugar on my jacket sleeve.

812
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

813
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,020
This one is like to go back to you.

814
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,020
Oh, I love you.

815
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:04,020
And while it wasn't peace, all of this.

816
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:11,020
But you thank you, though.

817
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:17,020
She's a train wreck.

818
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,020
Crushing that place to the east.

819
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,020
She's always there.

820
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,020
She's always whistin' me up.

821
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,020
And I don't know why.

822
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,020
Because all of you, you told her I don't know why.

823
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,020
And I don't know why.

824
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,020
And I don't know why.

825
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,020
And I'll take my jacket sleeve again.

826
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,020
And all my dreams and superstitions

827
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,020
I've been burning all the back of her.

828
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,020
It's a common little close with her.

829
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,020
Make sugar on my jacket sleeve.

830
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

831
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,020
And while it wasn't peace, all of this.

832
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

833
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

834
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,020
And while it wasn't peace, all of this.

835
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,020
And while it wasn't peace, all of this.

836
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,020
And while it wasn't peace, all of this.

837
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

838
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

839
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

840
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

841
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

842
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

Come on, this world feels better sweet.

00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

847
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

848
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

Come on, this world feels better sweet.

00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

855
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

856
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,020
Come on, this world feels better sweet.

Come on, this world feels better sweet.

874
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:51,420
I'm walking away, I'm walking away, I'm walking away, I'm walking away, I'm walking

875
00:44:51,420 --> 00:45:02,140
out.

876
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:08,420
Blue vagrants from the pod save music network of music.podgeshow.com and bankrupt is dead.

877
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,060
Fine title for a high school band.

878
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,380
And before I forget, if you want to listen to a great rock and roll podcast, rock and

879
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,580
roll geek Michael Butler interviews Susie Quattro on the most recent episode of the

880
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,860
rock and roll geek show, at least the most recent one that I listened to was really

881
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,860
good.

882
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,860
Cool.

883
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,940
There's a lot of things I didn't know about her.

884
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,100
And in fact, there was quite bias until I had never heard her speak it interview and

885
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,940
it was very cool.

886
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,660
So that's it, 45 minutes on the nose, give her take half a minute, I'll be back tomorrow

887
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,740
the day after, you know, whenever I'm not flying and have some more cool stuff to talk

888
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,620
about, all the stuff that I skipped today.

889
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,340
Take care, everybody, and have a great day.

890
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:53,340
Pot show, breaking out of fat sack of the good stuff.
