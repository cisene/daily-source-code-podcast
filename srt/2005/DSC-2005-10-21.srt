1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
10. Delta Shiaracharli, 2. 6. 4.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey, you a date is now. Friday!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
1. Hit, free, no, it's Friday.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
3. No, it's all right.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
3. No, it's all right.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
3. No, it's all right.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are no secrets.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Only information you don't get out of it.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Adam Curry.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Fantastic.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's Adam Curry.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
October 21st, the year of our Lord is 2005. Good morning.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How you doing? We made it Friday.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Almost did a show every single day this week.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I am so proud of us.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Once again from a foggy northern California morning.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sure the sun will start to burn it off soon enough.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It is your daily source code and it is Friday.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Happy birthday to my niece, Roxy.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She turns 23 years old today.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I know she and her mom listened to the show almost religiously.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So although, of course, by the time she's hearing this,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
the day is almost over with the frickin' time difference.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, man. Hey, guess what? I have a bed.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We actually had little Chinese food bed assembly party here last night.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ron and his lovely wife Martha came over and I haven't slept this well in ages.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can tell you though, man.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There's a lot of work that goes in the putting a bed together.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But once you've got the frame kind of down and understand where the cross pieces go

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and you've kind of out, you know, all your little bolts and wing nuts

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and slick and lock in the new hikies.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm good with motorized things, like engines.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But when it comes to putting pieces of steel together, no, no, not all I do.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So of course, forget pictures.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I got to do a video cast from here.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So seeing as the new power works are out, that means shopping this weekend.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to get me a G5.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm back, one of those dual processor jobs and a brand new power book.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And then we'll do a video podcast from the Curry Kondo.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Kick it off though with a wonderful mashup.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Check this out.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's it.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We're going hard.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We're going hard.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We're going hard.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're going hard.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're going hard.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And you know, we don't give up.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's a lot of work there.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Go find me in the club.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Find it for the book.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My mouth.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I want you to need it.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can fill the balls.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm gonna have the same sign.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And make it love.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000

My mouth.

258
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000

So come give me a hug.

261
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,920
Actually it came from a new source. I should mention who that came from home on a second. Let me just see if I can find it

262
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,720
Naina oops, Naina

263
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Naina should be enough in Gmail to pick it up, right? Let's see if it gets it. Oh, here we go

264
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,800
Dice Van Tinnon. Let me just see what his email says here. I made a mashup of Naina's 99

265
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,740
Loved balloons of 50 cents in the club a friend of mine suggested I send it to you as an idea for your podcast. Yeah, fantastic

266
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,980
Thanks, thank you very much. So he's he's from the Netherlands

267
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:41,460
Where a lot of the new music has always come from at least as it comes to stuff that's done with technology and remixed and comes out of keyboards

268
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,780
A lot of the house scene really grew up in the Netherlands. Hey, man, look at all the DJs we got from there. Huh DJ Tiesto

269
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Man, I used to work with

270
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,420
Roland Molendack back in the day. He's big now in the club scene

271
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,540
So let me tell you right up front

272
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,380
First like have different headphones on so I got to kind of get used to the sound

273
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:09,460
I think yesterday the one of these these white ones these Mac alley headphones, which are nice because they're

274
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:17,440
They're also noise reducing headsets. I think I blew out the left and the left earpiece all it all you hear in your left ear

275
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,940
Like

276
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,940
And how blown out yours

277
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,000
So gotta get used to this sound. This is a this is actually a very nice one. These are

278
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,220
JVCs also noise cancelling, but I don't put the noise cancelling on because that is very distracting today's source code

279
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,220
It's Friday

280
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,980
Lots of sex in today's show so if you're easily offended or if they're young children around keep them away from the show today

281
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,060
And not just you know not porn well, maybe a little bit of porn, but really

282
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
I guess I made a prediction

283
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,500
When the video iPod came out, you know the first thing I thought was uh-huh JOP and

284
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,740
That's a

285
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:03,020
A term I coined oh five years ago the JOP that's what the internet needs JOP stands for jerk off platform

286
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,580
I should try building that believe it or not

287
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,660
But it seems that the video iPod just may become the JOP and I predict that actually

288
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,540
It was interesting because I said that on the source code was picked up on a whole different

289
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,620
Told bunch of different new sources like AP picked it up, you know the the pod father predicts the new video iPod will be great for porn

290
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,740
Well, maybe I should have re-specified maybe I should have said

291
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,180
Relationships that would have been better because this is totally going to make it for

292
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,780
Dating anyway you want to get in touch with someone

293
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,820
But also I can totally see RSS feeds of

294
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,900
Products coming off of eBay, I mean you can go on and on and people are really experimenting with this

295
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,100
So it's extremely cool to see what's going on and oh yeah

296
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:57,420
Within not just a week of of the release of the or two weeks of the release of the video iPod we have POV pod dot com

297
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:06,780
POV stand. It's a that's a a cinemat cinemat cinemat cinemat cinemat cinemat

298
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,620
That's a term they're using the moving making business call POV

299
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,580
Point of view

300
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,580
So if you're thinking of actually I should look at this website because they have instructions

301
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,100
Well, you're supposed to do as you're supposed to

302
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,500
Subscribe when you bring it up here POV pod dot com you're supposed to subscribe to their feed

303
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,660
Actually, they here it is

304
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,220
Okay, yes, I agree sexual content. Okay

305
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
POV pod dot com step one

306
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,580
And this is really funny they have like little iTunes character, you know

307
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,660
It's always a silhouette of someone and you see the white headphones and the white iPod

308
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,500
So there's a guy sitting on a on a an office chair

309
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:55,500
As a step one download our videos to your iPod through iTunes six you can subscribe actually two hold iPod at crotch level

310
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,540
Three watch our point of view video and feel like you're there

311
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,700
So I thought we'd now mega sag is great. It should play the the video there we go

312
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,860
Huh

313
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:19,820
This is amazing so what I'm looking at is and actually I think the French I don't know where these movies are coming from but I don't think they were made specifically for POV pod dot com

314
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,100
Which is kind of disappointing because what you what you kind of want is

315
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,780
You know you'd want to hear some dialogue or something's very specific to this fabulous new invention of point of view

316
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,540
Poenography and so they're all they're all French

317
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
French actors and

318
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,740
You can kind of hear what's going on. Okay, now let me see if I can stop this

319
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
There we go

320
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,620
So you might want to check that out. It's clearly where things and once you get video, you know that's

321
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,540
When we got pictures what was the first thing that happened on the internet you know well the first thing that happened is

322
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,540
People told Mark Andreason that he was going to kill the net because pictures were going to pollute everything

323
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,780
And of course that may be true, but I think it's a much richer experience now

324
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,020
Yesterday I played a promo for you from Pacific Coast Hellway. They were so excited

325
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,620
Mark and the Pacific Hell Coast players that they had finally I mean it's listening

326
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:29,900
He's got like 13 years old finally they had gotten Sarah the 21-year-old virgin to call into their comment line

327
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:38,940
And to produce say what do you call it a self in he can't even say masturbation a self-induced orgasm and I must say the promo was great

328
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,740
The whole you know the whole build up to this one and a half minute piece of audio was fantastic

329
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,820
Well, it was a little bit disappointing about it though is they went straight into I don't know if if there was any pre-amble to the call

330
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
I would have liked to have here

331
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Hey Chris

332
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,460
Yeah, because you're on the show. Yeah, yeah

333
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,260
What

334
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,100
Yeah, can I can I call you back in like half an hour and we can talk about that?

335
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Okay

336
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,940
Okay, bye

337
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,140
I'm a such high demand

338
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,020
But you see we do break for we do break for work

339
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,180
Okay, so a little bit disappointing that

340
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
We didn't have

341
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:38,220
The kind of like pre-amble to when she first called into the voice mail system or the neo left her her voice message

342
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
So that was a bit of a bummer

343
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,500
But of course the whole it sounded pretty realistic and that was cool so that was a and of course

344
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,700
You never want to see what she looks like we never want we don't want to know anything more

345
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,340
It's so cool just to hear some audio and kind of let your fantasy go about you know

346
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,060
What Sarah the 21-year-old virgin looks like so anyway

347
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:07,820
They built this up as the first orgasm on a podcast and I promptly received some audio feedback

348
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:15,900
From Melissa and Melissa is from San Francisco and I it's amazing that I never found her podcast before

349
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,460
She also never sent into promo and said this is the first time she's ever

350
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,580
Don't eat any type of audio promotional stuff for her podcast called the horror cast

351
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,180
I don't be thrown off immediately by the title because

352
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,660
Melissa is

353
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,940
Well, let me just play the feedback for you and then we'll talk about it. Hold on. Here comes

354
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,580
Hello Adam. This is Melissa Sharif. I'm San Francisco

355
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,340
of the podcast or cast at sacredhor.org

356
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,060
And tonight I was waiting for MUNI probably not too far from curry condo itself

357
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,900
And I was listening of course to daily source code for October 20, 2005 in which

358
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,780
Of course, I'm one of your promos you promised the orgasm of a 21-year-old virgin

359
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
So now I know Adam something about you

360
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,980
Oh podcast with orgasms. Well, I have just the thing in February of 2005

361
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,900
I believe I became responsible for the first orgasm to be delivered by RSS

362
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,020
In the form of a podcast of course, I'm gonna start sleeping in the bed here and just let it fade out for all of you

363
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,500
Only rejoign only without for waiting

364
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,540
for the scenario you saw in the study

365
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,240
or in the last we moved the pages of Herodis

366
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:44,640
Sebastian you

367
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,860
dreams and to build3% in

368
00:15:47,860 --> 00:16:02,260
You want to hear the rest, you can visit SacredHorror.org, thank you Adam, I've been

369
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
a much warmer night.

370
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,860
So, obviously I didn't go and check that out, I'm not going to go to any website to

371
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,980
listen to that.

372
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,980
So, I did check out Melissa's website, she's a podcast, interesting, she does one podcast

373
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,780
a month, and she really is exploring sexuality, this is not about porn, although it is, of

374
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,660
course, in a way, also about porn, which is a part of sexuality, but very, very interesting,

375
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,100
interesting podcast, interesting experiments, participatory experiments that she's getting

376
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,500
her listeners into.

377
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,740
So, I'm going to keep my eye on this one.

378
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,700
This is someone doing something completely new, and it really works because she's focusing

379
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
on the audio of it.

380
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,580
I don't think at all that she's interested in all about the video, she's probably done

381
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:56,980
enough video in her life, that this is something new, and I got to tell you, the more I see

382
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:05,900
video of podcasters, the less I like it, and it's purely because you build up some kind

383
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:13,820
of visual, you build up an image of what someone looks like, what their surroundings are,

384
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:19,220
for instance, well, let's take the Pacific Coast Hellwife, for example, so Mark always talks

385
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,300
about being in the studio three series or three series studio, so I guess he has a BMW

386
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:30,580
three series, so I immediately have a car in my imagination, and I can kind of visualize what

387
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,700
he may or may not look like, where he has his microphone and where he's driving, you know,

388
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,740
if he really, he may not even be driving, I don't know, it certainly sounds realistic

389
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,340
enough, but then sometimes I think, maybe that's just done in the studio, but it

390
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,500
doesn't matter, it's all my imagination, it's like reading a book, you know, it really

391
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:57,220
makes my mind work, and the minute you add video to it, although the initial excitement

392
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,620
just about, hey, wait a minute, someone created a video and now I can watch it and it

393
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,020
comes in automatically, and all that's extremely cool, but it does take away all of

394
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:11,060
those elements of, yeah, have imagination, so I'm kind of torn between all this stuff,

395
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,700
for instance, he'll all get, here's an experiment, this is what we're going to do, this

396
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,100
is a good one, since this is Friday, I want you all to think about what the Curry condo looks

397
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:26,580
like, where I am, what I'm doing the show, what I'm wearing, what the view is like, just,

398
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,980
you know, all the things that you've heard in the past couple of shows when we've been

399
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:37,700
talking, we're doing this from the condo, and then on Monday, if not over the weekend, but

400
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,420
maybe I will do it over the weekend, anyway, once I want to get the new machines in here,

401
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:54,980
let's just say, I got to get those guys to pay me to do that. So either over the weekend, depending

402
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,980
on the time in the setup, or certainly on Monday's daily source code, I'll do a companion video

403
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,780
podcast, because I'll have enough machines to be able to record it properly, and then, you

404
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,620
have to kind of think, how could you, it'd be nice if you could draw a schematic, maybe that's

405
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,860
an interesting way to do a draw a schematic of the living room in the kitchen, because I'm podcasting

406
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,060
from kind of both, so I think I've discussed many times what the setup is here, so maybe you just

407
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:29,300
draw a schematic, and then compare that to what you actually see, and then I want to know if

408
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,580
you were disappointed or not, or if the mistake is thing, I think the mistake actually goes away,

409
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,180
that's what it is. You know, many times I've been asked my magazines, you know, can they

410
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,380
or television shows, you know, we want to, we want to be there when you're doing the podcast,

411
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,380
want to take pictures, want to take a video, and I'm like, no, you know, you take away all the magic,

412
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,020
you know, the sound that I'm creating, that's the visual that I want you to have.

413
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,300
So I'm just being a little careful on the video stuff, but I do want to experiment with it,

414
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:03,140
I really do, so I hope you'll join me for that. Hi Adam, it's Andy here driving around in the

415
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,140
mojo crash mobile unit on a beautiful UK autumn day, listening to the daily source code on the

416
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,380
iPod. It just occurred to me that today is my one year anniversary of first hearing the daily source code,

417
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:24,420
and I haven't missed the day, and I have to say when I first heard you, I thought,

418
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,380
ooh, that Adam is a bit of a cheese monkey, he's a bit of a medallion man, you know what I mean?

419
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,420
I'm telling on me, to the extent that now if you miss a show, I mean a medallion man,

420
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:43,780
what the hell is that? A medallion man, it doesn't sound very good, feel a sense of loss,

421
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:50,580
a profound sense of loss, and if somebody burps, I think of senseo, so thanks a bunch for that.

422
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:29,380
I use it, I'm demotivating it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

423
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:59,380
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

424
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:29,380
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

425
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:59,380
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

426
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:29,380

427
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:59,380
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

428
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:29,380

you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the last video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video, I'll see you in the next video,

431
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:38,040
Dope sound system, album, music.podshow.com is where you can find all kinds of music, not

432
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,240
just indie rock or alternative.

433
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,740
There's even classical music showing up now, which, and I'm not, it has to be synthesized

434
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,300
or orchestration that I'm hearing, but it's, it's pretty damn good, it's just a humane.

435
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,420
Well, you know, I can go on and on about all the great music that's coming out of the

436
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,420
podsake music network.

437
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:05,140
Some good news that is starting to reach me about my quest for a new car to run on biodiesel.

438
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:12,420
So it seems like a lot, you know, Volkswagen who do have an interesting diesel automobiles.

439
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,940
And it's not the new facade, I've been looking at that, because you know, I've got the Audi A8,

440
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,660
but that's way overqualified for the mission.

441
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,900
So I want to get rid of that at the end of the year.

442
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,900
And I was, and I looked at the facade, it's interesting, they have, they've really, they're

443
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,580
really taking a whole different tag on, you know, what a car should have, and they have

444
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:35,180
all these, you know, little special lights and little places to put stuff and, and is it

445
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,620
the facade that has the, the chilled glove box, so you can put your fresh sushi in there

446
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,180
and chill it on the way before you consume it.

447
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
So that looks kind of cool.

448
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,580
That looks like a nice car.

449
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,620
D on something smaller, I'm looking definitely looking for something a bit smaller.

450
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,780
And of course Volkswagen and Audi, virtually the same company or automobiles, I presume.

451
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:58,420
So if, of course, it won't have the, the quattro, the all-wheel drive, which I like

452
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,420
so much, particularly for the, for the winter months.

453
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:07,500
And then I was watching a commercial that came by yesterday on the new TV for the Ford Motor

454
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Company.

455
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,940
And man, they're doing a lot, in fact, they're whole push now, as you saw the, the chairman,

456
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,740
the CEO and chairman, Mr Ford himself, who, of course, is a, I guess, grandson of Greg

457
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,540
Ransson of, that must be Greg Ransson of, of the original Henry Ford.

458
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,060
And he was really saying that, you know, we're pushing towards less dependency on foreign

459
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,060
oil.

460
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,460
And they're talking about their hybrid engines, their ethanol.

461
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:39,420
And in fact, they were coming out with an SUV that runs on ethanol, diesel or biodiesel.

462
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,940
Like, wow, you know, they're, that, now that's an American company who just doesn't

463
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,700
take any shit when someone tries to put the squeeze on us for oil, I'm loving that.

464
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,540
Of course, it's going to be interesting to see, you know, how that, how that moves along

465
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,980
with the interest of big oil, because big oil and big automobile companies do kind of

466
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,500
go hand in hand.

467
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,860
So, um, but that's a very positive, very positive change.

468
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
I'm excited about that.

469
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,700
So, still looking forward to seeing if we can get some kind of deal together, where under

470
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,900
supervision of the manufacturer, obviously, I mean, this would be one huge promotion.

471
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,020
And of course, it would be a lot of fun for me because, you know, I love doing shit from,

472
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
you know, from cars.

473
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
No problem.

474
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,460
We've done plenty of podcasts from the car, but now I want to learn how to do this biodiesel

475
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
thing.

476
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,660
You know, I want to learn, and I want to pass this information along so that we indeed

477
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,140
will not be dependent upon foreign oil.

478
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:34,700
So, all righty, uh, what else do we have to, oh, we got so much stuff to talk about.

479
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,580
Let's, let's open the door and let our friend Jan in for a second.

480
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
Come on, Jan.

481
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Hello.

482
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Oh, no, here I come.

483
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,820
Oh, I'm proud of you casting with Adam Curry.

484
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,820
Hey, Adam, are you ready to be stumps?

485
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
Oh, yeah.

486
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,620
Cause he used that little test with the iPhone X.

487
00:28:52,620 --> 00:29:00,020
Hey, Adam, this is a new hit test, it's number 68, and I guess it's a bit more difficult

488
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,980
because they are a bit shorter than usual.

489
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,980
So, here we go.

490
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,980
This is number one.

491
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,140
Uh, oh, I know that one.

492
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,900
No, no, no, no, no.

493
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,980
No, no, no, it's Alan Parsons project.

494
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
I don't know.

495
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,340
And number two.

496
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
Easy.

497
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,340
Okay.

498
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:27,740
And he's self-respecting DJ from the 80s would recognize foreigners called as eyes.

499
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,340
Number three.

500
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:41,780
That's either, it could be, he's so shy, no, that's just, uh, I want to talk about it.

501
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,060
And this is the first answer in today's hit test.

502
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:53,340
The song from 1982, this is the Ellen Parsons project, this is old and wise.

503
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:00,340
And I love it as far as my eyes can see.

504
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,340
There are shadows surrounding me.

505
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:31,340
When I move the wise, when they ask you, if you knew it, remember that you were a friend of mine.

506
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:46,340
As the fire of the earth on the floor, with all my eyes, oh, when I move the wise.

507
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,340
Answer number one, the Ellen Parsons project, and this is answer number two, foreigner.

508
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,340
This is cold in size.

509
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,340
You're as cold as ice.

510
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,340
You're willing to sacrifice our love.

511
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,340
You never take advice.

512
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Someday you'll pay the price I know.

513
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,340
I've seen it before, it happened all the time.

514
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,340
You're lonely, but no, you leave the world behind.

515
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
You're thinking of a goal.

516
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,340
You're going away.

517
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,340
From 1977, foreigners answered number two.

518
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,340
And this is a certain final answer for today's hit test.

519
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,340
From 1979, chic, I want your love.

520
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Can you tell I'm going through relationship crisis?

521
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,340
No, you don't say it.

522
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,340
Okay, that's it for today.

523
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,340
Don't forget to check out the iTunes links on the website if you want to buy some of the tracks.

524
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,340
And I hope you did well and had them all at them.

525
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,340
So, thanks for playing this one. See you next time.

526
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,340
For number 69. So until then, bye-bye.

527
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:10,340
With your relationship problems, I'm expecting episode 69 to be something incredibly special, my friend.

528
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,340
Part-time music.

529
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,340
And to round someone else.

530
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,340
Don't know, you don't show the way.

531
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,340
Don't know, someone like me.

532
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,340
It is the way you live in your chest.

533
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:11,340
I'll say I will not keep you wrong.

534
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,340
But you've been wasting all your time.

535
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,340
I'm poor as you don't say that.

536
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,340
You should know that it's the way.

537
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,340
One leg and one leg and one leg.

538
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:32,340
You're the first of them all.

539
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,340
It's a baby don't be so tight.

540
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,340
Don't know, you don't show the way.

541
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,340
Don't know, someone like me.

542
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
Someone like me.

543
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,340
It's the way you live in your chest.

544
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,340
Don't know, someone like me.

545
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Someone like me.

546
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,340
You're the first of them all.

547
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,340
It's the way you live in your chest.

548
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,340
Don't know, you don't show the way.

549
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,340
You're the first of them all.

550
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,340
You're the first of them all.

551
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,340
You're the first of them all.

552
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,340
That's the way we're in your chest.

553
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,740
San Francisco, Grittle, the Ferris of the Mall,

554
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,540
Pot's Same, from the Pot's Same Music Network

555
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,740
on the Friday edition of the Daily Source Code.

556
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,380
Hey, I got great news to report.

557
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,820
Yesterday, we had a couple of meetings

558
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:48,820
at the Pot Show HQ and the radio professionals

559
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,020
are now here.

560
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,220
They're showing up at our door of these are people

561
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,620
who are very, very excited about the opportunities

562
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,420
in podcasting.

563
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,060
We're talking all about the content side, OK?

564
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,500
Because remember, Pot Show is still about listeners.

565
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,660
So we're about getting great stuff to listeners

566
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,780
and great stuff comes from passionate and talented people.

567
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,220
And there are just thousands of them

568
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,260
in the radio industry.

569
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,260
Many of them without work.

570
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,580
Many of them who've given up on the radio industry

571
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,260
and who are now coming back and they're starting

572
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,900
to show up at our door.

573
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,500
And I can't, man, I could not be happier.

574
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,100
Because here it is.

575
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,540
We've pissed everyone off, at least clear channel has

576
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,180
and other large conglomerates, not just the listeners,

577
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,220
but also the people who've been doing the work all these years,

578
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,660
who you've commoditized down to card pushers.

579
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,300
They're ready.

580
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,700
They're coming in and they're showing up at our door

581
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,500
because in order to do this, you got to be able to eat.

582
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,340
So I think we're going to see some restart of some careers

583
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,500
and not just people who are behind the microphone,

584
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,700
but engineers, producers, writers,

585
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,540
it's, I think it's going to be fantastic.

586
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,500
So I just want to let you know that that's what happened yesterday.

587
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,580
Today, see what do we have?

588
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,860
Well, today we have the second, is it the second

589
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:13,260
Fubar Friday, this is a cultural phenomenon

590
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,140
that has started within the Podgeo offices, Friday afternoon,

591
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,700
Fubar Friday, we get together, we hang out,

592
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,820
we have drinks, we present what we're working on,

593
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,620
what we're thinking of, and just generally have a good time.

594
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,460
And I've joined via IChat previously,

595
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,780
which of course puts the Fubar Friday well into Saturday morning

596
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,020
for me with the time difference.

597
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,860
So I'm looking forward to celebrating

598
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,820
with the boys and girls this afternoon.

599
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,740
And there's something wrong here with Nengaseg.

600
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,900
It's being a little shitty on that.

601
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,100
Oh, my God, it says it's there.

602
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Hello, almighty and most omnipotent part of it.

603
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
There's my song.

604
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,100
We approach you with a most unworthy request.

605
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,660

606
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,420

free by and intended for those of us

608
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,500
who can never hope to raise to your levels of greatness.

609
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,500
We ask you to play this for the ordinary average guy.

610
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,100
Hi, this is Bob Bickler from the ordinary average guy podcast.

Our podcast is all about how the average joes,

Sports, work, TV, tech, watching kids.

Just about 80 else in ordinary average guy deals with

on a day-to-day basis.

616

Throw in some pot-safe music, a few mash-up,

617

Thanks, Adam.

00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,980
Hot show, content that will make you squeeze the dog

622
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,460
and burp your mother.

623
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:56,700
In a world where everything is nothing as it seems.

624
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,700
In your stock, with a network engineer,

625
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,700
it a hard-tricking generator, and it's Halloween.

626
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Join us as we present the server room of horrors.

627
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,700
What secrets lurk in your server room?

628
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,700
This is a friends-in-tech production.

629
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:25,700
www.friends-in-tech.com.

630
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
I like that as a new network of podcasts.

631
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
There's fit.

632
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
The friends-in-tech sounds like they got something cool going on there.

633
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
And indeed, Halloween's coming up.

634
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,700
One of the things, if you go anywhere near an old record store,

635
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:41,700
that has vinyl, and you look around in the sound effects section,

636
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,700
I'm guaranteeing you will find full length LPs.

637
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,700
Of course, you can get them on CD, but it's much more fun to get the LPs,

638
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,700
because that's when you get the crackles and the scratches in there.

639
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,700
You'll get sound effect LPs.

640
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,700
Albums that have haling rules and all kind of scary things,

641
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,700
because that's, I think it probably originated,

642
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,700
well, it did originate with the old radio drama days,

643
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:12,700
and I have made so many little plays and things,

644
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,700
you know, acted out bits based upon those scary Halloween albums.

645
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,700
You know, I'm looking forward to seeing if we'll get more,

646
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,700
you know, more creative production on the podcast around Halloween,

647
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,700
and also around Christmas time.

648
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,700
You know, that's also coming up.

649
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,700
And here's something that struck me that is really messed up.

650
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,700
When we get closer to Christmas,

651
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,700
we won't be able to play Christmas music on podcasts.

652
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,700
How weird is that?

653
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Because you can't, you literally, I mean, well, you can do whatever you want,

654
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,700
but legally, you can't play white Christmas or jingle bells

655
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:02,700
or hark those herald, angel things.

656
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,700
Maybe there's some classical music and classical pieces that you can use,

657
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,700
but all of that stuff is copyrighted and someone owns that.

658
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,700
Just like happy birthday.

659
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,700
I cannot legally sing happy birthday on the podcast,

660
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,700
because it would be a performance of that song.

661
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,700
Isn't that weird?

662
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,700
Isn't that weird that we can't share the joy that Christmas carols and songs

663
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,700
bring, you know, to a human being, to an individual.

664
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,700
It's kind of embedded and grained in our DNA.

665
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
We can't do anything with it.

666
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,700
I find that almost grotesque.

667
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,700
I'm looking for Christmas music from the Podsake music network.

668
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,700
Please, I hope so.

669
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,700
By the way, isn't it time we came up with a couple of new damn Christmas songs?

670
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
I think so.

671
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,700
Call out there to all the artists listening.

672
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,700
Now check this out.

673
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Podcast ball is going on a little safari.

674
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:59,700
Swazilang is a tiny kingdom situated between Mozambique and South African.

675
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,700
With just over a million people, Swazilang has one terrible boast.

676
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,700
It's now the world's most highly infected place with AIDS and HIV.

677
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,700
One in two people are infected with HIV and AIDS.

678
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:21,700
Visit my progress at the Swazilang AIDS orphanage from 31st October

679
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,700
for a pair of about two weeks on podcastpool.com.

680
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
From my progress, I'll be podcasting.

681
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,700
I'm blogging from Swazilang.

682
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
See you then.

683
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,700
I wonder what it's going to use for connectivity.

684
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,700
Do they have cable there?

685
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,700
Hey, Adam Mark Peacock from the Travel Comments podcast.

686
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Hey, thanks for playing my promo on last Friday's Daily Source Code.

687
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,700
And your recollection is correct.

688
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,700
The Travel Comments podcast is recorded from hotel bathrooms around the world.

689
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,700
From the bathroom of the Marriott Courtyard in Olds, Mar Florida,

690
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,700
coming to you from the bathroom of the Budapest, Marriott of Twelet,

691
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,700
of the Nova Tell and downtown Geneva, Switzerland.

692
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:15,700
The orchard hotel in San Francisco, coming to you from the bathroom of the camel back in

693
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,700
and Scottsdale, Arizona.

694
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,700
If I can sneak in another promo for this week's Travel Comments podcast,

695
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,700
a bit of an odds and ends podcast, but some of the odds and ends,

696
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,700
we're talking about trouble with chain saws, kind of the TSA coming around

697
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
being a little bit more civilized.

698
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,700
We're talking about that fourth quarter dash for program status.

699
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,700
And finally, we've got an update on our Travel Comments web poll on

700
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,700
favorite US Airlines.

701
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,700
So, again, thanks for the promo and I hope everybody will join us at

702
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,700
www.travelcomments.trav.lc.au.

703
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,700
Double M-O-N-Hash.com.

704
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,700
Thanks and take care.

705
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,700
Hey gang, my name is Zen and I am a host of the Zen Show.

706
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,700
I'm coming to you from Newcastle, Washington on the east side of the

707
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,700
Greater Seattle area.

708
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,700
And if I've got a show for you, three times a week I take you through

709
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,700
things I find of interest, maybe some sound scenes or interviews

710
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,700
recorded from my trail.

711
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,700
And of course, hits and favorites from the pod safe music network

712
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,700
music.podshow.com.

713
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, my half hour show is available for

714
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,700
download.

715
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,700
You never know what will be involved in each episode.

716
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,700
Sometimes it's local news or comedy or just a rant.

717
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,700
If you want to leave some feedback you can send in an email at

718
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,700

show notes.

725
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,700
Until next time, if you can't be good, be careful or at least

726
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,700
don't get caught.

727
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,700
We'll see you next episode.

728
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,700
Yeah.

729
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
And I don't get caught.

730
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,700
That's a good one.

731
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,700
All right.

732
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,700
Just wind them down the show for today.

733
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Looking through the gmail box, a couple things.

734
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,700
David sent me an email.

735
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
The US Army has started a singing competition.

736
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,700
And it's called Military Idol MilitaryItal.com.

737
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,700
And they're streaming it.

738
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,700
So you might want to check that out.

739
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,700
Let's see what else came in.

740
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,700
There was a story on New York News Day about

741
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,700
using podcasts for lectures in college.

742
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,700
And they start off with, do you think this is good?

743
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,700
Do you think that this will only incentivize people to skip class

744
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,700
and only listen to the podcast?

745
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,700
I'm like, why isn't anyone thinking of the obvious here?

746
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,700
The obvious is, of course, you go to the lecture.

747
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,700
And of course, it's easy and convenient if the lecture is podcasts.

748
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,700
So if you miss the lecture, but how about if you go to the lecture,

749
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,700
then there's actually some follow-up information

750
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,700
that the professor, whoever is giving the lecture,

751
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,700
can actually give as an additional piece.

752
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,700
You know, and that you could actually,

753
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,700
and it wouldn't have to be a lecture hall.

754
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,700
They could sit at home and maybe create a much more personal environment

755
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,700
for what they're trying to communicate.

756
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,700
And oh, here's one.

757
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,700
You know, there's a lot, a lot of talk about trademarks,

758
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,700
always on the internet.

759
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,700
In fact, I heard, I read somewhere,

760
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,700
that Apple is now sending a cease and desist letters

761
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,700
to anyone, but primarily, I guess, podcasters,

762
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,700
who are using the word iPod in their show name,

763
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,700
or in their URL name, or if they're actually using artwork

764
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,700
of an iPod on their show blog,

765
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,700
the receiving cease and desist letters.

766
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,700
Which, of course, is, you know, if you don't really understand

767
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,700
how trademark works and how important it is to protect your trademarks,

768
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,700
it comes across as being pretty fucking rude

769
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,700
from a big company like that.

770
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,700
But here's what can happen.

771
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:44,700
This is apparently Google in the United Kingdom

772
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,700
is embroiled in a lawsuit over the use of the name Gmail.

773
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,700
There's a company that had been using Gmail for its clients.

774
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,700
I think there's a financial services company

775
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,700
and there's some kind of special email application called Gmail,

776
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,700
and they've been using that for two years.

777
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,700
And Google has actually, at least temporarily,

778
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,700
stopped using Gmail.

779
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,700
You sign up to Gmail now in the United Kingdom.

780
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,700
You don't get a Gmail.com address, but you get GoogleMail.com.

781
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,700
So, you know, just goes to show that this trademarking stuff

782
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,700
is pretty powerful.

783
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,700
And if you have a trademark and you've defended it properly,

784
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,700
you can even, you know,

785
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,700
you have the right, essentially, as a much smaller company,

786
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,700
to keep Google at bay.

787
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,700
Now, if I were Google, I just paid the $48 million

788
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
and move on.

789
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,700
You know, just licensed that shit immediately,

790
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,700
but that, of course, is, you know,

791
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,700
that's their DNA.

792
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,700
And I'm not quite sure.

793
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,700
It's funny.

794
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,700
You know, when something,

795
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,700
you see this happen over and over again.

796
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,700
When you've got to kind of like the run

797
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,700
and the underdog and the underdog grows and gets big.

798
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,700
And then even if it's, you know,

799
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,700
not even true, people start to build up some kind of

800
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,700
anti-feelings about the big guy.

801
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,700
And so then, and this happens everywhere.

802
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,700
I see it, it's just happening podcasting.

803
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,700
How many people hate me?

804
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
Because, well, who knows?

805
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,700
Why?

806
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,700
I got some ideas.

807
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,700
Okay, that's it for today's show.

808
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,700
DailySourceCode.com is where you can find

809
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,700
the latest episode.

810
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,700
And, of course, the podcast feed feedback.

811
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,700
More than welcome, particularly,

812
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,700
well, just tell me some feedback.

813
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,700
Adamadcurry.com.

814
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,700
If you can at all, please do not attach your file

815
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,700
to the email, just put it up on a server somewhere,

816
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,700
with the ID3 tags in there, and we're off and rolling.

817
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,700
Now, I shoot, man.

818
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,700
I got, all right, I got to keep all this stuff from Monday.

819
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
We have a lot of stuff to do.

820
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,700
And, of course, as promised, I'll come up with the

821
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,700
video podcast of the DailySourceCode from the condo.

822
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,700
Have a great weekend, everybody.

823
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,700
If we don't speak over the weekend,

824
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,700
it'll definitely be Monday.

825
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,700
Bye-bye.

826
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,700
Another pod show podcast.

827
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,700
Stick it in your ear.
