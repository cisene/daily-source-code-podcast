There are no secrets

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Holy information you don't even have

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I'm Korean

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm proud it's

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strap to my ass

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Trains, meters

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Fantastic

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's actually Thursday night

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yep

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Welcome to with the daily source code

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
From the curry condo

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My last night here for this day

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
With this particular stretch on the oil rig

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And here this

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What's this?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Copicina from a real cop

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Power of the North

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh yeah

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I got delivered

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I got service baby JC

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Penny

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Came through

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sure you're going to be very interested about that

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So of course I'll

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're giving you all kinds of detail about the move in

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But on the eve of departing after almost three weeks

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm finally moved in

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's see

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
One, two, two, I'd say music

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Good tunes, hit test

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Lots of feedback about some of the topics we've been talking about

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Power of the North

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And of course the obligatory promo here and there

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I tell you the Bank of America building

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
All of a sudden it lit up

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Someone was projecting

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I guess the city was projecting a movie

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It literally

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Clips of air races and airplanes

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
For fleet week we just coming up next week

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Of course when I'm not here

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can have the best seat in the house

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Just from sitting here at the condo

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So watch the movie was kind of fun

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Doesn't really compensate

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, doesn't

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I received a mashup

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a hot shoot man

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll have to add to my own week

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You know, to I got it from

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Not from art at mashup.com

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But it was specifically sent to me

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is a perfect mashup to get the weekend going

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
RK 47

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You got it yet?

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's see if the liver I'm your slave in

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Got my win, said good bye

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Now I'm back and not a pain in the crowd

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Woo, boom baby

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Wow, you are so lucky that we haven't done podcasts, DJ set up here almost, you know, I'm standing in the kitchen, looking out into the living room, you could, you know, it's a bar, so you could sit on the other side and we could have a couple mics there and I could have some speakers, so, you know, we could play some tunes and talk and it could be, it could be, kind of like a fun setting to do interview shows and stuff like that. I know, it's just, just hit me. Now, of course, that the place feels like home, JC Penny delivered Ron and I were,

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:32,000
in, what does it call there? Well, in Silicon Valley, I forgot what town it is. We were visiting with Randy Commissar, one of our board members, he's at Kleiner Perkins. We'd like to hook up with the, you know, at least everyone of our board members almost every week because we have so many things that they can help us with.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And just the road of decks is our amazing when that, when those open up, you know, we can get to almost anybody we want, so we're having just an amazing time here.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But we were late coming back and, of course, the Bay Bridge is right here next to the next, the Caricando. So, it's all the traffic, Jesus Christ, that's a humongous penis limo. Wow.

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's one of those, we're like the hot tub in the back. Fantastic. All right.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So I'm looking, literally, looking what's coming off of the Bay Bridge right now. So all the traffic goes right up my street, all the rush hour traffic home.

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So it was about five o'clock, you know, that was great. So JC Penny was supposed to deliver between three and seven.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I've been in almost constant contact with Mario, my man downstairs at the front desk.

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I got in and he said, oh, look, you know, your neon's been delivered. I might show that was put in in the condo and I said,

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Has JC Penny called yet? I said, oh, the shit's already upstairs. I hadn't put it in the kitchen, which, of course, he didn't know that was the studio.

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, you know, I got up here and there, yeah, for 12, 14 boxes, I located the three boxes that contain the bed and put those aside.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ron has promised me we're going to do a bed cast.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ron and Adam put a bed together. Uh-huh. Maybe we should have the pod casters over and we'll do like a pod squad and we'll have a mini party, what we put the bed together.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And then, you know, and I was like, oh, man, what am I going to do? I knew I wanted to record the source code and I still hadn't eaten yet.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I haven't actually made myself, you know, bacon and eggs and I had some vegetables and I'm eating up everything that's perishable, essentially.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And I heard Patricia's voice in my head, she's saying, make it make yourself comfortable, make it all comfortable for yourself.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She's like, since sailing me, sound baptizing me. I can just hear, and after 18 years of marriage, we're going to get to the 20 years.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's finally working. All the nagging. It's paying off. I can hear it now. It's I've been conditioned.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And so that, you know, instead of waiting until I come back in a couple weeks, just screw it, I'm going to go do it. So all the boxes are open.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You know, everything was individually wrapped. Every single thing. I mean, you even have to put these lamps together. So beautiful, beautiful lamps.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We have the lampshade is in place wrapped in plastic and the lamp itself was wrapped in plastic and you have to put the the fitting, you have to screw it onto the base.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And just a lot of unwrapping and there's, you know, styrofoam and some boxes and that cracks and breaks and there's styrofoam balls all over the place.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, and every and gosh, man, I don't know, I think Patricia made a mistake, but you know, I'd need like maybe, you know, so if you had four, four,

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and four knives, maybe you'd double it just to make it easy on myself, you know, have eight of each. I think I've like 20 of each.

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And everyone individually wrapped, I might have had. But, you know, I've got the full, you know, the steak knives, the regular knives, the dessert forks, the regular forks, the soup spoons, the vegetable spoons, the salad tongs, the whole freaking deal.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And linen. Oh, yeah. I gotta tell you something about my wife. She is a linen freak. Her linen colloset is kind of her thing.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And she washes her sheets herself and she has sheets that she's had with her for 15 years. You know, these, and she's that are expensive and, you know, they do last a long time and there's a special thickness to them. What is 150 something thread. Oh, yeah, threads. That's what it is.

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So she ordered two sets of, you know, king size linen and they come in that I can, this is porn for her. This is totally porn for Patricia.

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like computer porn when when when I get a new computer and I unwrap it and this smells nice, you know what I mean?

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So anyway, in her linen closet, everything smells fresh and all the towels are in there and, and by the way, the fold, the round side of anything that's folded sticks is on the outside.

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And everything's perfectly aligned and it's straight. It smells warm and soft and fuzzy. I'm not kidding. It's really her thing.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And I'm down with it, man, because our bed at home is just like it's sleeping in a cloud. It's fantastic. So she's totally trying to set me up, but I can just understand how she's, and she's bum, she's bum, she isn't here to help me out and, and, you know, get a lot of this stuff up and running. I've done pretty good though. I think I've done pretty good.

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So when I come back, we'll just do the bed and, uh, yeah, then I'm almost there. Oh, and, uh, well, I'll talk about the neonos. That's a whole new story.

184
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey Adam, this is Chris Malkard from the top floor podcast. I'm standing at the window of my top floor in the middle of a thunderstorm. I'm taking pictures of lightning bolts.

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm hearing that. This is life. This is not fake. And I'm doing a photography podcast, tip from the top floor.com, and, well, I'm just taking, this is amazing. You should see those lightning bolts here.

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And it's starting to rain thunderstorms coming up, and I just thought I'd say hi from right in the middle of a thunderstorm and send you a picture with it. And, you know, maybe you can play this on the show.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, are you just seeing the lightning bolt? Wow. No, it's starting to rain out. Remove the camera from the window. Otherwise, it's gonna drown. Oh man, this is amazing. Close that window. And, oh, I can't believe this is happening.

188
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Wow. Well, you have to know when to end, especially at the point when it's getting too dangerous and I have to actually go around the house and close a few more windows.

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I hope you'll be with us next time. I'll do another sound seeing kind of thing. Alright, that was it from the top floor. This is Chris Malkard. Thanks for listening.

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Pod Show, content that will make you squeeze the dog and burp your mother.

192
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey Adam, it's Omar, and I'm talking to you from your 70 National Park, and interestingly enough, the curry village campgrounds.

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm at your 70 National Park, because I'm traveling across the country in my beautiful Jetta, and my friend P is along with me, and we are podcasting along the hallway, we're halfway across the country.

194
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We started in Fort Waterdale. Now, we got the other half of the country to do in the Southwest, and Vegas, Grand Canyon and all that, but we've already been to Yellowstone National Park, the Badlands, Mount Rushmore, all those cool places.

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And I just wanted to let you know, not just how much fun we're having, road tripping across the country and back, but how fun it is to record everything we're doing, then putting it on a podcast and letting our friends and family listen to it.

196
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I look forward to doing another podcast someday. I'm getting in the videoography as a new field, and I was thinking, combining that with some of the ideas you've talked about, another podcast about GPS positioning and podcast and video might be something cool to try out.

197
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So, check the website out, it's roadboreyourpodcast.com, and if you want like your listeners know about it, and I think it's real cool.

198
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I keep up the good work for promoting podcast and getting pod show and everything else connected to it up and running.

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Thank you.

200
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm jealous of that. That's what I wanted to do with my girls. I wanted to take a, I tried to get air streamed to sponsor that we never could make that happen. It was a little too early in the podcasting success curve, I guess.

201
00:15:46,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Maybe we'll still have that. I want to, you know, go do routes, well, not maybe in Route 66, but, you know, really go east to west or something and go to, you know, from maybe Texas to San Francisco or just to some cool route.

202
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Camp curry where you are and where you recorded that in your semity national park used to belong to my family. Absolutely true. In fact, the curry clan as they're known really mainly from Kansas, my, my great, my great uncle. I think something like that was John Stewart curry.

203
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Famous rural painter hangs in the metropolitan museum of art. I think one of those in New York.

204
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And so the curry clan would have family reunions, a lot of them from Kansas, and they'd all go to Camp Curry, which is, I said, I'm not quite sure who owned it, but there was a, there's like firefall rock or something man, I'm bad at this. I really should know better. My grandfather less than he's probably yelling at me right now for not having the whole story.

205
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He always maintained the entire genealogy of our family and I have it. I have all the documents, but it, you know, it's a lot to go through.

206
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But there was, I don't know, I don't know which curry member that was, but they had built huge bonfires up on this cliff and then at night when everyone was, it was time to go to bed and they'd kick the embers over this cliff and I guess the main dude would say, let the fire fall.

207
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There's some family lore for it. We also owned a humongous piece of land, what is today known as Flagstaff, Arizona.

208
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So some brilliant light in the family sold that for a joint.

209
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So I can't get to my Gmail, otherwise I would tell you who sent me this next clip. This is, I've been collecting some audio and this is, oh man, we have, we have so much to learn yet about what you can do with sound and what is exciting and what radio is.

210
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is actually a piece of real radio. I think it's from CB2, which is not Australian radio station. Now, I played you the piece from the fly with me podcast where we listened to the air, actually was not air traffic control, but it was maintenance talking with the jet blue aircraft that had the nose wheel problem, the gear was down, but the nose wheel was cocked 90 degrees and so they basically had to, you know, blew out everything because the wheels don't roll that way when they landed.

211
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Beautiful landing. I've received transcripts or writings from people who were on jet blue and they're experienced because they actually had direct TV and they were watching themselves alive on television through direct TV, making emergency landing. How twisted is that?

212
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The writing of that is just, it's beautiful and everyone was high-fiving and jumping up and down when they landed safely and the whole vibe is described very, very well.

213
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But I don't have any audio of that. I mean, that's the final piece that I want because what I have now is, and this is live radio is good for this.

214
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You know, in podcasts, of course, are good because you'll see even though you're getting this live, the excitement of how this Australian broadcaster, I have a window open. How this Australian broadcaster was reporting on this landing live in a real time.

215
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's really, it's like a sporting event. It's great radio. No matter what you're saying, it's great radio. So I'm going to play that for you. And if anyone, or if you know anyone who was on that jet blue flight, of course, there was no podcast or who actually recorded it.

216
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Man, you know, I would have flipped on the eye river. I don't care. I'm sure I would have remembered to do that part.

217
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I know I would have. I hope I would, and I hope I would be able to use it. And of course, yeah. Anyway, so here is, here's the recording from that Australian station CB2.

218
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That you really enjoy. This is great. Great audio. As the plane comes in on descent, the most crucial time, obviously, as it hits the deck, will the nose will twist round to the way it should be.

219
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They're on approach now. The captain has made the decision that they'll go in. The jet blue flight 292 with 139 people aboard is attempting the emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport.

220
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I guess the people on board are hoping to God that the captain will be in control by the time they come to the end of the runway.

221
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They'll deploy the shoots, no doubt the slides out of the side once it does come to a halt. Emergency services are on standby now. You can see the tops of houses now on the tops of trees quite clearly in the background.

222
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:46,000
As this airliner makes its final approach to Los Angeles International Airport. The vision is coming from a fixed camera on the control tower now. It's over the top of the airport.

223
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The captain is bringing it to the ground now. It's not too far above the ground. It's about to come down. He's continuing the descent in Los Angeles International Airport with the landing gear problem of the A320.

224
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,000
139 people, the lives and the hands of this man landing the aircraft. He's over the top of the runway now. He's still coming down. He hasn't aboard of the landing.

225
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So obviously the decision has been taken. Another freeway is left behind him and now he can see the ground below him. He's about to touch down.

226
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The A320. It's about to touch the ground and then the hearts are in the mouths of the people watching across the globe and listening as well. He comes in. He's just meters above the ground now.

227
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The captain brings it down very gently. The back wheels go down first and now they're on the ground. They're about to touch.

228
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And the nose wheel is about to come down now. Will it turn around? The back wheels go down. The puffs of smoke come out. The captain tries to slow it down. This is unbelievable.

229
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The A320 is on the ground. The nose wheel still hasn't touched yet. He's easing it down ever so gently. Ever so gently.

230
00:21:47,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It touches now. This smoke comes up. The sparks fly. It hasn't straightened down. But something now. He's done it. He saved their lives. They'll emerge. Get out of there straight away now. The A320 is on the ground. He has done it.

231
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This fellow has done it. The crew would now be getting to the emergency slides to open them as well. They still haven't opened on either side of the aircraft.

232
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But the jet blue flight 292 has made a perfect emergency landing. There is no fire at all. It's stationary now on the center of the airport.

233
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Stationery at LAX. This is unbelievable. Quite incredible. The first of the emergency crews arrive on the scene. They still haven't opened the doors. They still haven't put the emergency slides down.

234
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:40,000
There are now many, many emergency vehicles surrounding it. They're watching the nose wheel which sparks were flying. Smoke was coming from at cascading back below the aircraft.

235
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But they still haven't taken the people off the aircraft at the moment. I expected they'd be doing that immediately. They haven't done it. There is obviously no imminent danger to the nose on board.

236
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The captain has decided to leave them on the aircraft for the time being. The aircraft is now surrounded by emergency vehicles.

237
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And they're all trained on that nose wheel. This is absolutely incredible. You'll see the vision later tonight. My God, it was frightening sitting in a studio watching it.

238
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What would it have been like on board the aircraft? What would have been like for the captain who's done an unbelievable job along with his crew to bring this aircraft to a safe halt at the end of Los Angeles International Airport?

239
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh, man. Oh, man. Is that great or what that to me? It's a classic, classic piece of audio.

240
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And I just wish I had air traffic control in that jet blue aircraft, which had a recording of that. It exists somewhere. I know the tapes do exist.

241
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Maybe Mike is minute, which of course the podcast doesn't exist anymore, but he used the podcast from the control tower in I think was Toledo Ohio.

242
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I was a great podcast. Maybe he'll be able to get the tapes to us.

243
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And then of course, just anyone who can send in a recording of what it was like. Wow. What a great collection that would be, huh?

244
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Wow. We could package that and sponsor it. But,

245
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Prius? Prius? Man, everyone's correcting me on that. I don't know how to pronounce that either.

246
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's the car that Madge Weinstein wants for free. One of those hybrids get into her willia.

247
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:26,000
She'll promote it. It'll be worth it. It will be worth it. Imagine Madge Weinstein and Chancy in a golf cart.

248
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:38,000
By the way, I apologize. Oh, man. I can't believe I'm so freaking stupid. I actually uploaded the Thursday's entire show from the condo early.

249
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Because I need to get everything done because we're simultaneously casting on serious now.

250
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And so I kind of have to have stuff done before, well, before like two or three PM East Coast time for it to go into their system.

251
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Just go from an MP3. They take my podcast and it goes, uh, Pete up does and turns it into an MP2 or whatever their format is for the satellite.

252
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Are we in stereo, by the way? We used to be in mono. Are we in stereo now on channel 103? I don't know. I haven't received my complimentary boombox yet.

253
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So I've been using the MM50 with the sometimes with the iPod. I find now I'm sinking the iPod up more and then it's because it's really convenient just to take it.

254
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
No wires attached. You know, just take the remote control into the bathroom with me to the bedroom. It's like a little iPod boombox.

255
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And so I haven't heard the show yet.

256
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But who was kind of confusing the cousin Bruce you was on between six and seven, which was the start at six are our maiden voyage.

257
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And we had to wait an hour for cousin Brucey.

258
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He's unbelievably popular though. It's really, that's about three things when people call up at serious. They ask about how we're stern.

259
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They ask about, okay, I think I don't know if they ask for cousin Brucey next or the pod show and Adam Curry after that.

260
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I have a feeling it could be because it cousin Brucey, but that's okay, where when you're laying on the ground, my friends, there's only one way to go and that's up.

261
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Podsafe music now from a buddy mine from the Netherlands. I don't think it's in the Podsafe music network, but I will definitely reach out to him and ask him to put it in.

262
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I've received permission to to play it on any podcast any time. I think he had a, he, this is the guy Roger with his, I don't know if his bands exist in twine.

263
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And he, the first season of idols of pop idol, it's called idols in the Netherlands. So this is two years ago, I think.

264
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Two years ago? Yeah, maybe two years ago.

265
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He was really smart. He had already had a band and he participated in the band in idols and he got through the first or second round, whatever.

266
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And then he had to sign the contract and he said, oh no, I'm not because I'm quitting because now I've got the attention I wanted for my band.

267
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So, you know, that works because he got attention, but it doesn't work that way with mainstream media because then everyone's like fuck you man, you don't want to play our game, you think you're going to get a shortcut, no way.

268
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So I'm happy to pick it up here and now that we have a lot of traction going on with this Podsafe music thing, it's time.

269
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It starts off mellow, but it really starts to rock out at the end. I think that this, this could be huge.

270
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This is a song that I think would be great for an American audience. I don't think they've ever really been exposed to it. So here it goes. This is in twine and happy.

271
00:27:46,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You know what you've done? Could you confess your face with me? Isn't it strange that you told me and won't think suddenly change your mind?

272
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Isn't it strange that you'd come here for me turn away and leave me behind? Now if he's like I'm drowning, please like I'm drowning away without you.

273
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I know the feeling, because I felt real so bad for. I hope you don't feel just like me. I hope you don't feel just like me. I hope you don't feel just like me.

274
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I hope you don't feel like me. Isn't it strange that the world seems to turn away when I try and explain what's so strange that you can be as one.

275
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:23,000
If he's like I'm drowning, please like I'm drowning away without you. I know the feeling, because I felt real so bad for. If he's like I'm drowning away without you.

276
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I hope you don't feel just like me. I hope you don't feel just like me. I hope you don't feel just like me.

277
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I hope you don't feel just like me. I hope you don't feel just like me. I hope you don't feel just like me. I hope you don't feel just like me.

278
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,560
I hope you're so free with just life and fuck I hope you feel much more

279
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,000
than me, maybe not so I'm in

280
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Not so I'm in, not so I'm in

281
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Not so I'm in, we'll go to my will

282
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Not so I'm in, not so I'm in, not so I'm in

283
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We'll go to my will

284
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Man, that song sounds so good, I love that song

285
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
In twine, happy pod save from the daily source code

286
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
As determined by the artist himself, that's what makes it really cool.

287
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I see on my console here that I've had two skips in the recording of the show.

288
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't know what the hell is going on. This Mac has had it.

289
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And I've had, and I have had this Mac for three years. This is a power book G4

290
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Three years, I think, yeah, you can't get any more powerful than this one.

291
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And usually with the Mac it's like an etchist sketch man.

292
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's like, if it doesn't work, you just shake it, close it, shake it, and then it's all good.

293
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But after a while, I think they just get sick.

294
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Windows machines have that too.

295
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So a lot of people ask me what I'm using to record the show

296
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
When I'm on the road to I use audio hijack pro.

297
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And I use megaseg.

298
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The megaseg is a real good scheduling program.

299
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You can segue stuff into each other and line stuff up easily.

300
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah, it works really well for the way.

301
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
As Ron would say, I'm a line guy.

302
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I hit record and I go, there's no editing.

303
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And all my processing, my mixer, my effects

304
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
is all external on a Yamaha workstation.

305
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And so basically just feeding the headphone output goes into the mixer.

306
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And the mic goes into the mixer.

307
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And so anything that play on megaseg, anything I play on my Mac basically

308
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
will be then fed to the mixer back into the line input of the Mac,

309
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and that is hijacked through audio hijack pro.

310
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So it's a pretty simple system.

311
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It really makes me my whole computer soundscape.

312
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So I realized I didn't even finish my story about why I'm such a doofus.

313
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So I had everything uploaded.

314
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I had to run off to the office because it's 10.

315
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
No, I'm 12, I thought it was 12, 30,

316
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
but 12, we had an interview with Entertainment Weekly.

317
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Because oh yeah, Hollywood's coming and knocking my friends.

318
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh man, part two of the plan is about to go into effect.

319
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Now we're going to misuse the mainstream media for our own promotion.

320
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
At first they were in control driving it with the interviews.

321
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Now we've got audience now.

322
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
We're getting pretty powerful here.

323
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I found out that if my information is wrong, please correct me.

324
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But the numbers that radio stations typically have of listeners

325
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
is measured in the quarter hour.

326
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
How much time do I have here?

327
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Is measured in the quarter hour.

328
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And that is done by arbitron.

329
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And it's typically done by people feeling out of diary

330
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
what they listen to.

331
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Forget about all that.

332
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Statisticians will argue with you for years.

333
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Whether it's a good sample or not, doesn't matter.

334
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So it's a sample of America that does this.

335
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And for a number one market,

336
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
a big market like New York or Los Angeles.

337
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That's a big market.

338
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
P1, I think they call it.

339
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
A typical station successful station in that market will have

340
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
10,000 listeners in that quarter hour and a 15 minute period.

341
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So, and really they do that because the audience changes

342
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
every 15 minutes, particularly during drive time.

343
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
People are popping around.

344
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
They're not listening to the commercials by the way.

345
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
That's when we switch away.

346
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
That's your 15 minute reason to switch.

347
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So it is possible that someone who was in the first 15 minutes of a

348
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
first quarter hour of an hour of the first 15 minutes of an hour comes

349
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
back in the third quarter of that hour.

350
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But in total, Q, as they call it, they'll be 40,000 listeners in that hour.

351
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Well, we have some podcasts.

352
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
This one included that are well into the hundreds of thousands.

353
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And people aren't popping around.

354
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They may be, you know, programming the show the way they want it.

355
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I know lots of people that go right past the mashups.

356
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But that's a pretty sizable audience that we have.

357
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Bigger than a major market radio station.

358
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
That freaked me out.

359
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So, if you have any other statistics on that, let me know.

360
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But that's what I was told because I've been asking around.

361
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And, you know, I know a lot of people aren't really here still.

362
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Remember, radio, the lowest rung of the show is latter and podcasts hanging right underneath it.

363
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh, yes, my friend.

364
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Wait a minute.

365
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Did I even finish the goddamn story yet?

366
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
No, I haven't.

367
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Okay.

368
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So, the story is that we had the interview and then we had to run off to go to San Hill Road.

369
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And I forgot to post the show.

370
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And then I went through all this unpacking and completely forgot.

371
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And also, oh, my God, man, the show is uploaded, but never posted it.

372
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So, you may be listening to this show on Saturday or Sunday or whatever.

373
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So, that's all cool.

374
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But if you're a serious satellite radio listener, then you're listening to it on Friday.

375
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Okay, it's back to the hit test now, sir.

376
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What did you hear?

377
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The hit test.

378
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Hey Adam, it's time for hit test number 62, but before we start, I would like to address a question that's been asked

379
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
a lot lately and it's about the processing I use and how I make it sound so so good and so clear in post production.

380
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Well, let me say that I like Adam use cast blast time record live.

381
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
The only difference between my processing and Adam's is that mine sounds good.

382
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Just oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, man, I'm going to get you for that.

383
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, sure.

384
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's time for hit test Adam.

385
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
All right, three intros as always.

386
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And this is number one.

387
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Hit me.

388
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
James Ingram, Patty Austin, baby come to me.

389
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You're going to put your arms around number two.

390
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Okay.

391
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Well, I'm going to know it.

392
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Knowing it to you, John, I'm going to say that's the original.

393
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
That's going to be Rick James and super freaky baby.

394
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Number three.

395
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Hit me again with that.

396
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Jesus.

397
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And time's up.

398
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
This is answer number one.

399
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Patty Austin and James Ingram, baby come to me.

400
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
When you know that nobody's standing by your side.

401
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me when I'm so close to you, come to me, come to me.

402
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Come to me.

403
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Come to me.

404
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Because I can't go back to living without you, come to me.

405
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The first answer in this early 80's edition of the hit test.

406
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Betty Austin and James Ingram and baby come to me a song from 1983.

407
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And this is answer number two, from 81.

408
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's Rick James. This is Super Freak.

409
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Very cheeky girl.

410
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The kind you don't think will do my best.

411
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
She will never let your spirits down.

412
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Once you get it off the street, I'll go.

413
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That girl is making it easy.

414
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Girls are super break.

415
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I really like to chase stuff.

416
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Right timing me.

417
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
James alright.

418
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
James alright.

419
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah.

420
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah.

421
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

422
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Make no more drama.

423
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yet no more mistakes.

424
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's me.

425
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Come on.

426
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Come on.

427
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It just isn't me.

428
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Come on.

429
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And then it's me.

430
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Come on.

431
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It's just isn't me.

432
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Come on.

433
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Come on.

434
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And James.

435
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Me.

436
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
One, two, three.

437
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Come on.

438
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah.

439
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
A one hit wonder.

440
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000

452
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay Adam, I hope you did well.

453
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Again, great music to be playing here.

454
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
See you next time for 63.

455
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I guess somewhere next week.

456
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So until then, bye-bye.

457
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I love those songs, yom.

458
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Stacy let us saw a man that was 1980.

459
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I was working at the pirate radio station at Amsterdam.

460
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You know, that's what I miss about not being able to play.

461
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You know, we just haven't quite figured that out yet.

462
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
How we can play a lot of that back catalog.

463
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Oh man, skipping again.

464
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I know what the hell is going on.

465
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Damn.

466
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It just shows up that it's skipping.

467
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I got to reboot this Mac every single time I before I do a show.

468
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And now now iTunes is like just popping up and starting by itself.

469
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Making me angry.

470
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So I was going to say it's too bad that we can't play a lot of that back catalog.

471
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Because the story that goes with every single song,

472
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I could tell some awesome stories about the Stacy lattice top period.

473
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And we'll have our stories later on about the cruise box.

474
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And the brother loves and the lascivious bitties.

475
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And you know what, we'll have those days too.

476
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm sure.

477
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Let me see, well, so I have written down here.

478
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
We're going to talk written down.

479
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's on the Blackberry right.

480
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And it says now that this is the cool way.

481
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The cool way to maintain what you're going to talk about.

482
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Of course.

483
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You got it.

484
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Oh, the neon.

485
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm going to talk about that.

486
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The pod father neon that Greg Lawley gave me.

487
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So I put it in front of the window is exactly the right dimension for the window.

488
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And I was really excited about it.

489
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And then I went downstairs.

490
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And 24 stories is just way too much.

491
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I mean, I have pictures.

492
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I tried to take pictures of it.

493
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It was really hard because it's just too high up.

494
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And it's not big enough.

495
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You know, it would have to literally be across the whole wall of windows in order for you

496
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
to be able to see it from anywhere.

497
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I mean, you can see it.

498
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But you just can't make out what it says.

499
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So now it's in the corner of the condo here.

500
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And I turn it on.

501
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And before I record, I turn it on.

502
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
The pod father in green and purple neon is fantastic.

503
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'll post pictures of it once I get back to the cottage.

504
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Um, now I screw it to promos.

505
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Do you guys remember?

506
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom.

507
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
The first podcast for the French-speaking Mac community?

508
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Well, it's me, Steph and C.

509
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And I'm back with a German version.

510
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So it's called Pom, Pom, Pom still.

511
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's just at Pomcast.com slash DE.

512
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Because I have to rework the website at Pomcast.com

513
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
to make it in French and also in German.

514
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But also in English for the presentation side.

515
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But basically I'm also on iTunes.

516
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And for the French part, I'm on the iTunes music tour French.

517
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm already, I'm always in the top 20.

518
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I follow the German.

519
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's a little bit complicated.

520
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm not in the top 20.

521
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You have to search for me.

522
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You just search for P.O.M.

523
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The hell was exciting.

524
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And you're going to see directly Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom.

525
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And the variant in German, Pom, Pom, Pom, D.E.

526
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Which you can't listen directly in iTunes.

527
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Subscribe to it.

528
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Listen to me every week.

529
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
My name is Steph.

530
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm also reachable under the email stuff and see at Pomcast.com.

531
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And that's what I do.

532
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I do it in French.

533
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I do it in German.

534
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And I also listen to the daily source code, for example.

535
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'll show a dot com.

536
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Recommend listening with at least one foot firmly planted in reality.

537
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm finding yourself up all night looking at inappropriate things on the internet.

538
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I don't know if you're going to reach it forward.

539
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't know if you're going to reach it forward.

540
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Do you find yourself repeatedly showing up late for work?

541
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
French fries.

542
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Do not make themselves.

543
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You need to be here.

544
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
On time.

545
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Every day.

546
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Luckily for you.

547
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
There's an answer.

548
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's the drag me out of bed.

549
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000

Who is it?

553
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That hell out of bed.

554
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You dirty horror.

That's right.

556
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000

I wanted to play that last time.

It was a long, long time ago.

And that's because you lazy ass podcast.

575

It fills up all the time that I just spend here wasting through my blowhole otherwise.

586
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Hey, I checked out the pod take music network.

587
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
These girls are one of the top pod plays at the month.

588
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I know a girl named Betting who wears patting leather shoes.

589
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
She just moved from Missouri and she's feeling caliposed.

590
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:57,000
She says, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

That's a damn dashboard game.

593
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,300
That's a darn搦 before me.

594
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,100
the last.

595
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,900
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

596
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,700
Cut me.

597
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,200
I know it is.

598
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,200
I should promise, I could all get.

599
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
No, no, no, no, no, no man better

600
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,200
Who wears my stumbling shoes?

601
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,200
She gets her head on Thursdays, and she dined.

602
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,200
Robin' fools!

603
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Because as hair, hey, hey, into the mirror

604
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,200
Lookin' inside you will burst

605
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,200
But I still watch say you wake up as the sun lives through the sky

606
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
But I still watch say you wake up

607
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,200
