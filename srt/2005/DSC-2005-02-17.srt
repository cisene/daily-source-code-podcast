1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Daily source code for February 17th, 2005, transmitters, we don't need no stinkin' transmitters!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Autastic, it's Adam Curry!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, everybody, how you doing Thursday's source code, good evening!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The power of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Coming to you from the Health Hotel in Manhattan, New York!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's a daily source code, it is February 17th, 2005.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I might have quite a little bit later than usual, but fun stuff to report from the Big Apple!

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh boy, I gotta tell you, I am one jet lag puppy!

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We got a lot to talk about today, man.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What a day, what energy in this city, it's so good to be back.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I haven't been in New York since the 4-9-11.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Been in America, of course, since then, but I just hadn't been to the city.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And this city was my home for 13, almost 14 years in a combination of MTV and my company from the late 90s.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's great to be there.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, so even though I posted that I certainly have time tonight to catch up on email and do all kinds of other important stuff,

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
guess what?

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Life got in the way, man.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There are so many people that I haven't seen in ages.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It was just great catching up with all kinds of people all the time.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm talking about someone that's some of the people I've been seeing and some of the stuff that I've been hearing about podcasting,

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and I tell you, it's certainly a lie, man.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
People are talking about it, and I just walk on the street and people are like, hey, how's the podcast or love the podcast?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's just that stuff you don't expect, you know, it's like anywhere you go now.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Everyone knows what's going on and everybody's talking about it, and it's really, really exciting stuff.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, so we're going to try and do a reasonably traditional daily source code.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Got a promo, got a pod save, tune lined up for you, see what else?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, I have a, it's not really a mashup, it's, I guess we've got to come up with a name for these things.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a cover version, obviously, but it's kind of a wacky cover version.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We've been playing, what do you play?

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The minimum, the minimum, the minimum, the minimum, the minimum, the minimum, the minimum, the minimum.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, remember the name of these guys?

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It is, by the way, it's, it's way past my bedtime, it's 11.05, which means it's 4 a.m. in the UK.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I've only slept about four and a half hours each night, and that's just because, oh, man, it's just so much to do and so much to see and so many people.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
To talk to and hang out with, and then, you know, just want to think, okay, we're done, then someone calls, say, let's have dinner.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And let me tell you, New York City, this week is completely full, it's crazy ass booked full.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And I couldn't figure it out until, of course, I dropped by Central Park and, oh, yeah, the, the Christo art exhibit, which is the gates.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You've probably heard about this or read about it or seen the picture of it.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All of Central Park is basically covered in this, but what is art?

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And I have to agree that it's art, it's certainly a listening, a lot of responses, but it's these orange gates that are all throughout Central Park.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And it has brought an amazing amount of people to the city.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Every restaurant is full, every single hotel, book to the hill.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In fact, the, the Hilton was the only hotel, I, this is not my first choice of hotel.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
In fact, if anything, I like a little more downscale from the Hilton.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Although I have to say the Wi-Fi does kick ass here, but, yeah, this is like the only room I could get.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I'm basically in, kind of like a closet, you know, for 200 bucks a night.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So, thanks to, to the Christo art exhibit, all the prices have been jacked up in the city.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So I got the, got the lot of on.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I can walk around a little bit, look out the window and,

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:37,000
yeah, let's see, what's it going to do? Okay, yeah, I was talking about this cover version and this song that I want to play for you.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's see, it's by the gorge, and I think, I think you'll like this.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is pretty much a, a Snoop Dogg on Hacid acid, I guess.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, gin and juice? Well, here's the source code version for you.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So much drumming and bass, it's kind of hard bass, Snoop Dogg on G.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But I somehow somehow keep coming to the funk, yeah, shit.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Maybe everything is fine.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Can't I kick this off in?

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
For the G, he's in.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If I could be friends, it's a breeze through.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't you know, it's too in the morning, and I've already spilled your beer.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Cause my momma ain't home home.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I got the bitches in the living room, getting in home and play.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I ain't leaving till six, and I'm on it.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, what's wrong with you?

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I got a pocket full of rubbers in my home, boys do too.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Turn off in a lot of time.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Close your doors, but what?

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We don't love them, home.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then we're gonna smoke me now, so they have.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Jesus, how is that? Like your mother fuckers.

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Nice to learn.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I've been rolling out of straightens for getting in home.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sippin' on gin and juice, play back.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But burn on my money, my money on my mind.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Rolling out straightens for getting in home.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Sippin' on gin and juice.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Play back, my money on my mind.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I got the bitches in the living room, getting in the living room.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But burn on gin and juice, play back.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This type of shit happens all the time.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Got to get your men for again, my man.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you, man. We listen to the D.O.G.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He's got that couch and white music that we can't prevent.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
May he must.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I hear his words as funny as I'll type me and drink to many of the street.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I started happy with this bitch.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I insane.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, now she has to be there.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, oh, it's late.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't you know what?

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I need that grace.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't I care if that's your way?

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll call this a new taste.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Can you get another days at eight?

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I got bought with a doll plan.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But I'm crazy.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sippin' on gin and juice, play back.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But burn on my money, my money on my mind.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Rolling out straightens for getting in home.

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sippin' on gin and juice.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Live in my mind, my money on my mind.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll be rolling out straightens for getting in home.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Really?

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's late around that sky.

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
My home is not a drive.

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He came out with a good time drive.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He digging at my head that's driving.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I ain't a fat ass J-H-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:10:04,000
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A

125
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No la la!

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm fluttering at the edge.

127
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,760
Thank you for not being put.

128
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,180
I kiss your shoulders

129
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,880
much more

130
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,380
��!

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,700
yeah!

132
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,140
yeah!

133
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,840
yeah!

134
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,020
yeah!

135
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,840
yeah!

136
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,380
It's may notoward well.

137
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:26,860
yeah!

138
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,860
Let's believe in life.

139
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,160
It's true.

140
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:58,240
It's all right.

141
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:11,520
I love that version. Totally cool. And so I'm listening to that and I'm like, yeah,

142
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:20,640
I'll get into my D.O.W.G. mode and went to the top of the the cupboard or the, I guess the clothing

143
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,640
closet that's in the room here where I had carefully stash away the half of my, let's just

144
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:34,000
call it medicine. Soy, source code listeners, carefully brought into the country. And you know,

145
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,160
that's like, that's risky. So you want to, you want to be able to enjoy your medicine. And you know

146
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,320
that one of the cleaning ladies took that from me. And you know that she's walking around,

147
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,960
kind of wacky on the, on the 40th floor. I hate that, man. When, you know, you think you've, you've

148
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,440
stashed it and they won't find it and then it turns up this disappeared. Go, you, um, to anyway,

149
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:06,880
I'm a New York boy, live to in, in, in the city actually for, um, a year in 1987, 1988,

150
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:18,080
married my wife here. That was 1989. It actually was, end of 88, sorry. And just being up here reminds

151
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,400
me a couple of things. First of all, how much fun it is to look out the window and look at all these

152
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,920
other buildings and to kind of looking on other people's lives. I don't have a telescope used to

153
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,840
have one when we were in, uh, we live in the Symphony House on, uh, 56 in Broadway. 42nd floor was

154
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:40,560
beautiful corner penthouse apartment. It was just totally, you know, the, you know, Woody Allen view,

155
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,040
everything was, you know, right on. We had a telescope and you kind of looked at on other people's

156
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,600
lives. I know it's not like the thing you should be doing, but it's fun to look across. Now,

157
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,120
I don't have any magnifying optics, but I can see lots of people at work. You know, here it is 1115

158
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,960
people working hard. There's so much energy in, in this city. It just pumps me up. It really does.

159
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,240
And of course, I'll even enjoy it even more after I get a good night's sleep with all the, uh,

160
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,680
with all the jet lag. So I worked to, of course, at MTV. We moved out to Jersey in, uh, in 88,

161
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,720
and you know, started a family, had a daughter there. And I commuted in every single day and then around

162
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:26,000
1994, uh, in 1995, I left MTV, 94, 95, around there. Some of 94, I think, and started my own company

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,040
on ramp, uh, which pretty quickly turned into, uh, one of the very first New York-based internet advertising

164
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,960
companies. Um, now, so I kind of fell into that by default. Um, it wasn't exactly what we said

165
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,960
out to do. We actually had a whole entertainment concept, Metaverse.com. We had, uh, the vibe and

166
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,280
cyberslees, and I think I got my jacket here. It was, uh, it was a great, you know, we were really

167
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,600
creating content for a lot of big companies at a certain point. And then of course, we weren't much

168
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,280
more into an advertising service type businesses, you know, around 97, 98 people started to get

169
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:10,320
kind of wacky with the internet. Um, so I know a lot of people, uh, in New York is, is totally all about,

170
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,000
what's on New York's all about money, really. Um, it's where all the headquarters are the big companies.

171
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,800
It's where the advertising world is. It's where the media companies have their headquarters. Um,

172
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,760
and, uh, it's interesting, because I've met up with, you know, some old friends and radio advertising.

173
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,280
And everyone's nuts about podcasting. That's for sure. Everyone is, you know, that's, you know,

174
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,280
that's, you know, what I've been just meeting with people about, you know, they want to know what's

175
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,280
going on. And of course, these are all friends or businesses associates, most of them really friends

176
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,720
that I've known for a long time. And one thing I can guarantee you that there is a big fear

177
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,600
that radio is dying. And what that means is that the, you know, the radio companies, marketing advertising

178
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,560
companies are seeing that there's no new generation of listeners. Yeah, they know that there's radio,

179
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,760
but they don't care about it. And that much rather, you know, listen to their, uh, to their MP3 player

180
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,160
or sit on, you know, or do some Xbox gaming or, uh, in fact, that's where a lot of kids get their

181
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,560
music from us from video games, you know, the, the, the, the soundtracks to those. And we're going to see

182
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,880
more and more bands being launched through video games. That's what I'm hearing. Um, but we have no

183
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,720
one really tuning into radio anymore. And it scares the, the Jesus out of, uh, the advertising world,

184
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,480
we have some friends on Madison Avenue. Uh, this is with a big, you know, advertising companies

185
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,360
are who at one point we even share holders, uh, OmniCom was a shareholder in, uh, in our company

186
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,600
before we took it public. And gosh, I mean, they're, they are so interested in what can be done

187
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,040
with podcasting, but they all have, I think, don't quite have the, you know, the right idea.

188
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,360
They're trying to translate into radio, which, of course, it isn't. And we're going to talk

189
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,800
about radio in, in a couple of minutes, because I had the good fortune today, uh, to be invited

190
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,200
to go check out, um, and actually got a tour of serious radio, the satellite radio station,

191
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,240
or stations, I should say, is about 120 channels. So we're going to talk about that.

192
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,640
But first I want to play some pot-safe music for you from an old buddy. This is, uh, from Vladi,

193
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,760
Vladi used to work at a company, think new ideas. In fact, he was at on-ramp, he was one of the,

194
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,360
one of the first, who I'm going to say, one of the first 10 employees. And he's out in, uh,

195
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,520
he's been out on the west coast for, uh, for quite a while now doing all kinds of wacky stuff,

196
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,800
cinnamonow.com is, uh, where you can find a lot of bills work. Anyway, he sent me a podsafe tune,

197
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,680
and, uh, he sent me some, uh, some info for the show notes. Uh, the title of the song is second

198
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,760
best girl track off the misprint songs that girls like CD, and that is actually Vladi. Vladi,

199
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,080
Vladi, Vladi, Vladi, Vladi, Vladi, Vladi, Vladi, Vladi, Vladi, Vladi. He plays guitar and sings

200
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,040
back up. Uh, in fact, uh, on the track, I'm going to play for you right now. It features a slamming

201
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,960
guitar solo by my buddy, Vladi, Vl help her. So check it out here's second best girl on the daily

202
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:28,160
source class. I know that I'm not the worst, most of the track they've got, I'm not. I think in my

203
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:41,440
fun. Some things that you could go to night like I don't need a night. That you only

204
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:51,280
has to be for the time. Then you went to talk to yourself for the rest of the night.

205
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:11,280
It's out of view. If you're sad of me, it's second best girl, it's second best girl.

206
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:37,580
Oh, it's London grand, yeah, And so I've remember seen. All you knew is by my kids, Oh now I'm

207
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,580
And you never be

208
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,580
Except for garbage and seeds

209
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,580
And I don't mind

210
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,580
That you tell me I'm wasting my life all the time

211
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,580
I just say that you're my symbol

212
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,580
And I let that slide

213
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,580
I'll settle for you

214
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,580
If you settle for me

215
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Yeah, I'll settle for you

216
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,580
If you settle for me

217
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Said you'd love to go home

218
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Said you'd love to go home

219
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,580
Said you'd love to go home

220
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,580
Said you'd love to go home

221
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:14,580
Said you'd love to go home

222
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
Said you'd love to go home

223
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,580
Aらly I laugh so weird

224
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,580
Said you'd love to go home

225
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,580
Said you'd love to go home

226
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,580
Said you'd love to go home

227
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,580
Said you'd love to go home

228
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
Said you'd love to go home

229
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,580
And I'm going to survive and if it always makes me smile

230
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,580
But I can always say that I'm so loyal

231
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,580
And there's something I should tell you

232
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
And I'm sorry but it's true

233
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,580
But I don't need you something better than you

234
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,580
I'll set off you

235
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,580
If you'll set off me

236
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,580
You're the best I can do

237
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,580
For the time being

238
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Second must go

239
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,580

Second must go

282
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
Second must go

283
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:07,180
this world that actually reminded me a lot of podcasting, there's just, you know, cool people

284
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:14,540
all over the place, creativity, oozing out of every, just every nook and cranny, 42 studios

285
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:20,140
at this place. I'll all on one floor, you would not believe the infrastructure, everything

286
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:27,740
completely digital, mind boggling and mind blowing what these guys are doing, particularly because

287
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:35,580
it's like so much like podcasting, only they've got this incredible infrastructure.

288
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,500
I mean, it's, you know, I'm an idiot, I should have taken some pictures, I was just so

289
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,700
in awe, you know, I've been plenty of studios, but I've never seen so many and such a

290
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,540
just a production factory is set up, you know. Almost none of this stuff is actually live on

291
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,660
serious, what the way they do it is, you know, well first of all they have knobs of these channels

292
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,820
that are, you know, themed music channels, and every single channel has a program director

293
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,460
and he's got a little office and he's, he or she is responsible for everything that happens

294
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:16,060
on the channel. The shows that include people are, I think, just about all of them are pre-recorded

295
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:22,780
and the way it works is the talent will actually record their voice tracks at home, they basically

296
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,380
FTP them into into the mothership and there they've got a person for each show, pretty much

297
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,020
doing the way MTV used to do because we never saw the videos, we would just record, you know,

298
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:38,140
the links from one to the next and those would be inserted at the, at the knock the network

299
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:44,780
operation center, the basically the satellite upstreaming place. It's, that's pretty much the way

300
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,020
it's done here, it's, you know, I've spoken about some of these production systems. They're basically

301
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,380
two radio production systems that are digital that are being used professionally. One is called

302
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,220
Delet, that's used in, mainly Europe, things of German company and the states, most companies

303
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:06,620
use profit and essentially, you know, you can just take this track and they insert it in between

304
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,660
the songs and make it flow just like it was done live, which is the way I do the source code,

305
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,180
you know, I start and that's it, you know, I hit stop when I'm done. So to do a three-hour show

306
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,140
it's like 40 minutes of work for the air talent, but it doesn't matter because it, you know,

307
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,940
it works and it sounds great and, you know, I heard, this is like, what is an alternative

308
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:32,220
country and western channel, which was just mind boggling great stuff and as a mojo, nixon show

309
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,460
and we talked about mojo recently, he was the one that did these stuff and Martha's mother's song.

310
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,580
Wow, that guy's an amazing, he's a podcast, I'm telling you, it sounds great the way any

311
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,700
of what he's talking about and then I listen, they have listener comment lines, you can call

312
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,020
in, of course, that's also all recorded digitally and then can be fed into the shows.

313
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,180
It sounds just like audio comments, I mean, it's really exciting and you know, they can say

314
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,980
whatever they want and they can be irreverent, but still it's very hard and there's a lot of

315
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,020
escapy radio talent working there. I was bumping into people I knew left and right, kid

316
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:15,100
Kelly from, from as you 100 New York, human Newman, who I hadn't seen in ages, he's like

317
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:22,780
one big hug fest, you know, and it just, it was mind boggling, but then to see, and everyone would say,

318
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,260
oh, you know, if it weren't for the dot com hype, we wouldn't have all this infrastructure,

319
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,100
no one would ever have built that, I'm like, whoa, okay, so what do you telling me? Well,

320
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:38,060
telling me that is really the overhead of this place, it's just amazing, it's expensive, really expensive.

321
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,340
But very interesting, it was fun to see and I apologize, I'm a dick, I really will have to get some

322
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,900
pictures to show you this place and I'll ask Steve to do it because Steve just walked us all over the

323
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,540
place, we were looking at, you know, anything, could touch anything, could sniff it all and really

324
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,340
for a, for a podcasting broadcasting geek like me, it was wonderful, lots of winky,

325
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:05,180
blinky lights and knobs and buttons and faders and, and the way it was all integrated, I mean,

326
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,900
it was someone's dream project, so on basically said, hey, you know what, I'm going to build the

327
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,580
ultimate and they did, I don't know how much it cost to build this place, but, uh, whoo, I was just,

328
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,380
I was jealous, I was absolutely jealous, although when I compared and I see how much we can do just

329
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:27,500
on our, you know, on our PCs and our, our max, it's, uh, you know, we sound pretty much the same,

330
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,100
you know, uh, we're, although, now I guess technically we have more glitches, which I think is always fun,

331
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:41,180
by the way, if you're hearing this big plopping sound just before a song ends or, uh, or I want to

332
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,940
stong starts, that's because I don't have a mute button on the wireless microphone on the

333
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,260
live, so I basically have to turn the receiver off, which sounds like that. See, turning it on,

334
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,580
kind of gives a big plop. Somehow, I got, I need a button on this thing, or, of course,

335
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,340
I need to figure out how to do it even better in, uh, audio hijack pro.

336
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:06,380
Adam Curry, hey there, this is Greg Roach from Spirit of Place. That's triple dot dot

337
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:14,860
Craig Roach online dot com slash spirit of place. So that's my shameless plug. Listen, I love

338
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:22,140
your show, you're a freaking genius podcasting is ruining my life. So thanks a lot. Anyway, look,

339
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,580
here's what's on my mind. I thought you were suggesting for a reality TV show where you watch

340
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,020
celebrities get off cigarettes is brilliant, but I think we can do one better. I think you're missing

341
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:39,900
the bird on this one, pal. Celebrity rehab. How does that sound? Because you not tune in to watch,

342
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:46,140
Mary Kate and Ashley kick, like it in. I sure would. Anyway, thanks a lot, take care.

343
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,940
Greg, excellent. Yeah, celebrity rehab. That's a podcast by the way. We can do that. We don't need

344
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,060
video for that. We can do that in podcast, uh, excellent. There was something else I wanted to tell

345
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,820
you about a podcast that I caught on, um, openpodcast.org. Hold on, we can bring up iTunes here.

346
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:08,780
And it actually killed me what the host said in the show. Hold on a second. Let me see if

347
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:16,460
I can find it. It was the, I don't want to get it wrong. Um, oh, that was it. It was the podcast

348
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:23,500
from the front, here, front porch podcast. That's what it was. Love this podcast, comedian.

349
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,980
Guy tells really funny, topical jokes. Um, and it happened to you this up, so I apologize. Let me,

350
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,700
let me just see if I can get to this one particular point in the podcast. He was really slaying me with

351
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,780
some of the humor. I've cast on the block. I'm doing this in iTunes. I had about a two mile

352
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,420
rate. Fast forwarding when New York and these. If anybody can figure out how to spell it, I really

353
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,940
appreciate it. And hopefully I can get some of that into my own way. This is okay. I'll get all the

354
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,540
answers it. So he's talking about the source code, which of course I love, right? But that's not,

355
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,100
that's not what it's about. It's, you're saying something else about opiuml show notes. Okay.

356
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,980
It's okay. Um, and I should have killed this up. I apologize. Here we go.

357
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,060
Quirky, I'm like, why, you're, you're, you're a flyer. That's good for you. But why am I listening?

358
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,460
But I can't put it down. And I think, basically, you've somehow managed to, uh,

359
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:20,300
enclose crack cocaine, uh, into your opiuml file. So whatever you're doing, you know, good looking

360
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,820
out. Uh, I really appreciate it. And, uh, hopefully I can get some of that into my own podcast.

361
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,780
More of a trial runs. So I might not even have it. So yeah, that's a new technology that I've

362
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:36,700
been working on, uh, really hard at night. It's, uh, it's a way to enclose crack cocaine in the opiuml

363
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,620
show notes. Yeah, we're really working hard on that. All right. Let me do another mashup for you.

364
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:47,980
And then I'm going to get out of here, uh, see, uh, whoo, I'm going to meet up with some more friends

365
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:54,060
tomorrow. Uh, hopefully, um, just get a little bit of sight seeing. And that'll be nice. The weather is cold.

366
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,340
It hasn't been, it really hasn't been too nice. Uh, and I gotta say, I'm just, you know,

367
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:06,700
it's like, yeah, the, uh, the UK and Europe have been kind of cold, but this is just, it's, yeah,

368
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,020
it's like bitingly cold. You know, and it's not even that bad. It's like, I know, it's like 60,

369
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:18,940
65 degrees, something like that. It's, uh, not bad. So I'm trying to open up. I had, uh,

370
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,100
where's it go? Oh, here it is. Okay, here's another mashup that I want to play for you.

371
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,620
I had one by Madonna. I'm going to skip that one. I thought the M&M versus Wild Cherry is this.

372
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:34,220
Gonna be something you'd like to crank up on your MP3 player, your iPod, whatever your device of choice is.

373
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,820
Play that funky music without me.

374
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,820
M&M versus Wild Cherry.

375
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,060
I'm a source.

376
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,860
This looks like the top of me, so everybody just follow me.

377
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,940
Cause we need a little contrapercy, because it feels so empty without me.

378
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,660
Hey!

379
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,620
Yeah!

380
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,620
Yeah!

381
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,620
Crack, Crack, yes I did it

382
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,620
Do this go down and check out the show

383
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,620
This looks like a top of me, so everybody just follow me

384
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Cause we need a little conch of our sea

385
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
Cause it feels so beautiful without me

386
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Little aliens, kids feeling rebellious and embarrassed

387
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
The bear still listen and help us

388
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,620
They start feeling like prison is helpless

389
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Cause someone comes alone with a misunderstanding

390
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Y'all be a visionary, vision is scary

391
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Cause gonna revolution pollute me

392
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,620
It waves the rebel, don't listen to me

393
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,620
Revelling back in the back

394
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
I got everyone kiss of my ass

395
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,620
And it's a disaster, it's a disaster

396
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,620
So take a test of peace

397
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,620
But you can see, it's so damn much of my ass

398
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,620
You're asked for me, while I'm back

399
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

400
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,620
Fixing beds and a phone no, no, no, no, no, no

401
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
In a written up one of your skin

402
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,620
Like I spit out the synopsis, attention

403
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Back with a winner, I'm in arrestings

404
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,620
The best things I'm wrestling

405
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,620
The best things I'm wrestling

406
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,620
And the gift is the best thing

407
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Try to find a stand-belless

408
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,620
I thought that they were better than mine

409
00:33:41,620 --> 00:34:11,620
I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't

410
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:41,620
I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't remember, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, but I can't see, I can't see, I

411
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,220
I see a girl, but it wasn't easy

412
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,620
Changing rock and roll in my eyes

413
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,620
The thing I got me shaking

414
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,620
I fall I'd have to rape and get high

415
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,620
But now it's so much better

416
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
It's so much better

417
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,620
I'm fucking out and get out of the way

418
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,620
But I'm never lose I feel it

419
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,620
I'm how I'm alive and I'm your son and me

420
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
Yeah, this looks like a job for me

421
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,620
So where everybody just follow me

422
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,620
Because we need a little one

423
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Cause it feels so empty

424
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,620
Without me I said this looks like a job for me

425
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,620
So where everybody just follow me

426
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
Because we need a little one

427
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
Cause it feels so empty

428
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,620
Nah nah mh

429
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Nah nah nah nah

430
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
Mashup of M&M and Wild Cherryplay

431
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,620
That funky music without me

432
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
It's a JPL remix

433
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:20,120
So you can find all kinds of info about JPL remixes and perhaps this one as well.

434
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:26,620
You had mixfreaks.org and a fine Dutch association.

435
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:33,620
By the way, hearing that wild cherry song, I was like, was that 1978 something like that?

436
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,620
And I remember it, you know, it's one of those songs where you just go, oh yeah, that was the school dance.

437
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,620
I think it was 13 or 14 at the time.

438
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,620
And it was like, you know, that was the song, that was the head of the day.

439
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,620
Oh boy, feeling really old right now.

440
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,620
Okay, that's it.

441
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:55,620
We're just about at our 40-minute mark for today's sort of the hour of the day.

442
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,620
That'll do it for February 17th.

443
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
Yeah, 2005.

444
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
Tomorrow.

445
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
Well, it's the thank God of Friday edition.

446
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Maybe we'll have a hit test.

447
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,620
I didn't receive one from me on today, so.

448
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Of course, that's okay.

449
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,620
I can't imagine how he does those hit tests anyway.

450
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,620
And we're so far we've had 11 in rough, it's been great.

451
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,620
So maybe we'll do some of that.

452
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,620
Comment, add them at 3.com or actually hold off on the audio feedback.

453
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,620
The NB3 feedback of Gmail.com.

454
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:40,620
I'm now at 90% of my 1 gig and I guess I got to decide what I'm going to delete.

455
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,620
If anyone has any ideas of what I can do to archive some of this stuff,

456
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,620
still keep the same email address and let me know.

457
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,620
Although archives in the latest show, a daily source code.com.

458
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,620
That's it.

459
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
Good night.

460
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,620
New York.

461
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,620
Good night, universe.

462
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,620
I'll see you tomorrow.

463
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,620
Bye-bye.
