1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-3-9.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And now, coming to you from higher top podshow headquarters in beautiful Newark, Ohio,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
home of the world's largest basket.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, as all of you, hey!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They are part of your secrets.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Only information you don't be a liar.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And I'm Korean.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In the next generation radio concert in my ears.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And good morning, good afternoon, good evening,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Daddy's source code September 12, 2005.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And it's a Monday.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm very excited today.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're going to try a couple new things.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We're going to mix it up a little bit, so to speak.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the first thing we're going to do is we're not going to kick it off with a mash-out.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It seems like the mash-out well has run a little bit dry.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think everyone's having the same problems.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And I also think that's completely socialist.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I mean, it's like when shit's happening and when hurricanes are blowing through town

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and people's lives are uprooted and the news media is all about it.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I saw a drop in a slight drop in non-subscribed listeners.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I see less mash-ups coming through.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I see a raised activity of blogging.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's very interesting.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So anyway, no mash-out today, but that means, of course,

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
we'll have some mash-up songs in the form of a hit-test pod-safe music

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and actually aviation.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Aviation stuff.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What I say.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I'm practicing something new.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're going to like this one.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
For the first time in the history of my podcast,

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
have a timer running.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I've done a lot of thinking and a lot of talking to other people

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and it seems like the ideal link for a podcast comes in blocks

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and each block of time should be about 20 minutes.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So that's pretty much what people have timely

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
of the discretionary listening time in the morning.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
For the discretionary listening time at the end of the day.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And of course, you can split it up.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So what I'm trying today, just to ease into it nicely,

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is to try and create a 40-minute show.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I'm going to do it exactly.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going to time it.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I hope exactly to the 40 minutes.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't quite have the tools that I'm normally used to do this.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And the theory here is that if I commit to at least 20 minutes,

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
then either it's going to be a very compact rock and show,

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
or if I have little time, I could talk for 20 minutes,

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and I guess still make it worth your while, I think.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Or just go to the full 40 minutes.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to do today's full 40 minutes without a mashup,

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
which is interesting because that usually does take a good 3-5 minutes of the time.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The first thing I want to talk about though is about iTunes 5.0.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I didn't see Steve Jobs' keynote live until this week.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I didn't see the keynote or not keynote.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The presentation of the iPod Nano and the rocker phone,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and the other announcements that he made.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Of course, the iTunes 5.0 application, which is now out.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And I hadn't had a chance to see that,

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
but this weekend, of course, the girls were going.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So I had a major, major geek out weekend,

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
which, of course, means after I do the show,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've got to go through the house like a whirlwind,

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
because the girls would be on the way pretty soon.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They're just getting on the plane,

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
so they will arrive probably on 435.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So probably 530, they'll be home, I hope.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So I have to have everything to speak in Spanish by then.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Until then, we'll just keep it nice and messy.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We won't tell anybody.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So I had time to look at a whole bunch of stuff,

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
which I'll be talking about, including the keynote.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Man, I gotta say,

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm such a fan of the way Steve Jobs does those presentations.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And especially the way he had the iPod Nano,

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
which was the big surprise,

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and he had it in his little pants pocket, the whole while.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you haven't seen it, you know, guys,

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you have that little pocket on the right hand side of your trousers.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And you always wonder what that one's for.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, so Jobs was going through this whole thing,

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
showing, you know, presenting everything,

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
different guys on stage.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And then he says, have you ever wondered what this little pocket was for?

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And that's where he pulled the Nano out of.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And that was, you know, just great showmanship.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fucking fabulous.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And also I noticed that the way he was talking about podcast,

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
very much resembled the way we were,

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and myself, I recognized, you know, my own,

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
maybe excitement in the way he was talking about podcast,

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but, you know, like six months ago,

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
maybe even longer than that.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So, and I just kind of made me realize

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
that listening to all kinds of text shows

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
over the weekend, of course, you know,

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
nice and loud throughout the whole house.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Everything's streaming, one computer to the other.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I really took advantage of the situation.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You know, perhaps we still do really live in this

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
vacuum of tech and of geek.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And, you know, we think people catch on so easily.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And, you know, of course there's a million better features

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and a thousand better ways to do it.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But I think the masses are just now starting to tune

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
into this whole concept of podcasting.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And quite frankly, I want to play right into it.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I want to make the best listening experience ever,

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
because it seems like what we've been dreaming about

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
these 100 million listeners, they're actually going to come.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Look at the sales of the iPod.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What they sell, they sold six million iPods

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
in the last quarter alone.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I mean, this is just outrageous.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It really is.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Something else I noticed that was interesting though.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I just don't quite understand all the math.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Is that, what was it?

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They have 68% market share in the US of all MP3 players.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It seems to me like there's, you know, that you're not taking some

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
devices into account there.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But it doesn't matter.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I mean, I like my iPod and I have to be honest,

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think I'm going to pick up an iPod Nano.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That really, I think that really fits my lifestyle

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
because you already have this humongous MDA thing hanging off my belt

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
with, you know, limited playback capabilities.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Of course I can load software for it.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And of course I can get, you know, like a one gigabyte card

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and all that.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But at the end of the day, there's so much good functionality

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
in the iPod platform that I really do like it.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Now, what I'd also heard is that a lot of people had trouble

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
when upgrading to 5.0.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I heard some noise about subscriptions being lost

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and libraries not working.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So I kind of resisted, you know, like I'm, I'll wait for 5.01

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
or something like that.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But of course, I was doing so much stuff over the weekend

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
that a couple of reboots were involved.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And eventually you start up iTunes and it doesn't let you choose

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
anymore.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's like, you will upgrade now, dammit.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Wait, can I do this?

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hold on.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let me see.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If I can do this, this may have may not work.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You will upgrade now, dammit.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That was pretty good.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Good.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now I know that works too.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So upgraded and low and behold, when it fired up,

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it said something wrong with your database.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
All my podcast subscriptions were gone.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And I said, you know what?

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is the right weekend for this to happen.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So I, and I'd also decided I would do as many iTunes subscriptions

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
as possible just to see how that worked.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And I really hate the process.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You have to go back, you subscribe,

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but switch as windows, you have to go back,

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
click directory, search.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's not a very handy way to do it.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It seemed like the directory, and I've read lots of reports

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that the iTunes directory is a little bit

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
fruity, I guess we would say.

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Not screwy, but fruity.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Not everything is coming back,

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
or result that used to come back as a result.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So clearly they're working on something, doing some stuff.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And so I resubscribed to most of the podcasts I had,

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and some new ones as well.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And I started to manage a little bit differently.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I wanted to throw out old episodes that I've already heard,

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
because I really have to cut down on my disk usage,

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
my space is getting full everywhere,

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
not just Gmail, but everywhere.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's time for a new computer.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The asteroids are full on this one.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And this morning,

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and I'd actually taken the laptop with me to bed,

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
because I was listening to a couple of podcasts,

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and you just had the screen go blank,

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and it was just listening.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And I, you know, just when I was done, I closed the lid,

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
opened up this morning, fired up iTunes,

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and your database is corrupted, and low and behold,

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
it has all my songs,

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
but the only thing it blows out is all the podcasts subscriptions,

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
which of course completely blows.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So I hunted around on the web, looking for stuff,

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and the easiest fix that I found is what I tried,

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and what actually worked is,

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
in iTunes just to go to file import,

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and then import the XML file,

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
which is your iTunes Music Library XML file.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then it brought everything back in,

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and then under the podcast tab,

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
there were all my podcasts,

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
not just my new ones that I'd subscribed to,

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
but the old ones as well.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So I was actually pretty happy.

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I did have to physically click on the subscribe button

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
for each one, for it to go out,

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and I guess read download the podcasts that probably already had,

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
but that worked with I need problems.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So I'm hoping that it just,

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
it hangs together,

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and I think that there's something,

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
there's something buggy going on.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know if it's,

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
if you use subscriptions that aren't iTunes subscriptions,

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
or if you shut down while iTunes is running,

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
right now I'm definitely shutting down iTunes nicely,

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
before I let the computer go to sleep,

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
or anything even closely related to that.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So that was a big part of,

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and that was a big part of my cake weekend

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that I wanted to share with you.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I did some other things as well,

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and also hunted around for a couple of promos,

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and they're always sitting there in the Gmail box somewhere.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It was actually one of my favorites.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
When you want to get away from home and leave reality behind,

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you need a place like no other.

229
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They're going to give daddy the reinvance,

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
we take that, we're going to Vegas my cake.

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Place where you can gorge yourself,

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and in all you can eat buffet for $5.95.

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Place where you socially acceptable to go.

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
A place where you socially acceptable to order a couple beers before breakfast.

235
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
A place where little men will hand you free porn just for walking by.

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I hope that you're having an enjoyable stay here on Las Vegas,

237
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and also hope that you've been fortunate.

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But where does such a place exist?

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Vegas, baby, Vegas!

240
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If you want a complete escape from reality,

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
there's only one place to go, Las Vegas.

242
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000

It's Laura from the Pod Squad that's POD, SQOD,

260

who are a podcast all about audio.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We take a podcast and review different types of equipment,

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and we try to help people sound a little bit better.

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Not as good as you, of course,

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
because you are the godfather of podcasting.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But we are here to help all of those other people.

266
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000

that's Pod Squad, POD, SQOD.

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And we just want to say how much we enjoy

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the daily source code.

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I listen to it every day.

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I do remember you as a VGNM2D,

272
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you were the hottest VG of Vermont.

273
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And if you could just say hi, Laura,

274
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in your VGN kind of voice,

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
but who really make me happy.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So we add them, don't forget Pod Squad.com,

277
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
check us out.

278
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So that was without a doubt,

279
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
one of the highlights of the weekend.

280
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Hey, Laura.

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So you want me to say,

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
hey, Laura, in my DJ voice,

283
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
this is a favorite wallet,

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
because it would make her really happy.

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay.

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Hey, Laura.

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
How are you doing?

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I want to know what you're doing with that.

289
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hey, Laura, how are you doing?

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's what I want to know.

291
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So that made me feel pretty good,

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
as you can imagine.

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That definitely struck the ego.

294
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And then I,

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you know, I told you, I was messing around with my subscriptions,

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and I came to a podcast that I'm subscribed to.

297
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The,

298
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Jabberjaw podcast with a hard G,

299
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
bitches.

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And,

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
that was definitely one of the low points of my weekend.

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But anyway, okay,

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
today,

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I just want to say this week,

305
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
two day,

306
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
two day,

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
September 8th.

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But this week,

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
there were some birthdays.

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And I would like you to tell me,

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
what year do you think this week was Adam Curry's birthday?

312
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
How old do you think he is?

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Now,

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I want you to think for a second.

315
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You probably know,

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
because we've talked about it.

317
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But this was the first year that I heard anything like this.

318
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Adam Curry?

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Mm-hmm.

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I think Adam Curry is 43 years old.

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Ah!

322
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He says he was born in 1964,

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
which is 41,

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
which is a year old,

325
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
a year and some change older than us.

326
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Right.

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay.

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So you're both 40 and we're 39.

330
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Do you think that when we saw him on MTV,

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
he was the same age as us?

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Now, why would I not,

333
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I mean,

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't really remember.

335
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going to say he's fudging a bit.

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh!

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I think he's in it.

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
As a matter of fact,

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I think I saw Profile on him saying he was like in his low 40s.

340
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But not out.

341
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Profile?

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like one of my IM chat profiles.

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But not 41.

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because I would have made that connection.

346
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah.

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't think so.

348
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think he's girlifying his age.

349
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think so too.

350
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Like he's going to be a model or something,

351
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and he's trying to get him out.

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah.

353
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

354
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I started,

355
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I started early.

356
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I said my first TV gig was when I was 19.

357
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And I think I was 22 when I started MTV.

358
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So yeah, what's your age?

359
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I was only a year older.

360
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But that really hurts.

361
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Now, this is the question is,

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
do I look like I'm 43?

363
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Do we look like I'm 41?

364
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I needed some more ego stroking,

365
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but it didn't really come along over the weekend,

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
unfortunately.

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I did see something very cool on Fox.

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I had the Fox News channel here on my Sky TV,

369
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
which is great only.

370
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
When they go to commercials,

371
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
then they show this weather of the world.

372
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And it's very repetitive.

373
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And they play a hokey music under it.

374
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So that's kind of boring.

375
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But they were live.

376
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And I don't know if it was,

377
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
it was somewhat, some flooded area.

378
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't know if it was New Orleans or not.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And it was, you know,

380
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
now we've gotten to the point where it's the same.

381
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So they're just coming up with shit.

382
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And particularly these Fox News hosts,

383
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
they just talk really talk out of their ass.

384
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
They're very suggestive putting words in people's mouths

385
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
to steer a conversation.

386
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's fine, you know?

387
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't care.

388
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I can tell the difference between news and infotainment.

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And then the interview this one guy.

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And at first,

391
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
it was about,

392
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
they were talking about either the credit cards

393
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that they were made at Houston,

394
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
that they were handing out to people or checks

395
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
or basically getting resources to them.

396
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think we're talking $2,000

397
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to start off with per family,

398
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I believe.

399
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And so the guy clearly wasn't happy

400
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and had some, you know,

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
did see reporter on the ground

402
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
with a baseball cap on in her,

403
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
her, her, all weather,

404
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
you know,

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
all weather with standing down to ground zero vibe.

406
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And the host in the studio was even,

407
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
he was probably even worse.

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And so they're bantering back and forth.

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What absolutely nothing,

410
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
this guy said something in the background

411
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and then the host in the studio says,

412
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you know,

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
bring him back on.

414
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What was the question about,

415
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you know,

416
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
was that about the money?

417
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And this guy just goes off.

418
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And he's like,

419
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
who, you know,

420
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
it was like,

421
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
at a certain point,

422
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you know,

423
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
he was saying,

424
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
they're treating us like slaves,

425
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
you know,

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the notes get on the bus

427
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and not on the slave ship.

428
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And that's okay.

429
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That was just his opinion.

430
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But then he said,

431
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
they should just give us what we fucking deserve.

432
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I was like,

433
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
whoa.

434
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And then the,

435
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and the way the host,

436
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I wish actually I should have,

437
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
you know,

438
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
that probably was automatically recorded.

439
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I found and taped that for you.

440
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It was amazing.

441
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This guy tried to recover.

442
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And he's like,

443
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
well, you know,

444
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
10% of our flying high and,

445
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and people are very tired.

446
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And I was like,

447
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
you know,

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
finally we can get this in real news.

449
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
There's a guy who really wanted to say something.

450
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And they cut him off.

451
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And it wasn't because I don't think they were interested,

452
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but they're pre-programmed and pre-packaged,

453
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
you know,

454
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
not to let any of that

455
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
particularly because he said,

456
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the big F word.

457
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And then I'm going to ask you,

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
which I was spoken about before,

459
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
but what it really is the problem with the F word.

460
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I mean,

461
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
so it's an explotive,

462
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but what is the danger in it,

463
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
if you say it?

464
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Does that mean that people will go out

465
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and say,

466
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
oh,

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
fuck.

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Maybe I should go and fuck.

469
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I mean,

470
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
is that the danger?

471
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What, what is the danger?

472
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Where,

473
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and you know,

474
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
where is that?

475
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm just trying to understand,

476
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
you know,

477
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
what is the root?

478
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
When did that become a bad word?

479
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And why?

480
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm sure someone out there will be able to tell me,

481
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
or if there,

482
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
if probably this going to be

483
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
5,000 different urban legend reasons why,

484
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
or whatever,

485
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
but when did that become a bad word?

486
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
When did that become outlawed?

487
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Who said,

488
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and why?

489
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I just like to know that.

490
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm happy following along with the program,

491
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
because people do seem very offended by my use of the word.

492
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So we're up to the 21 minute mark here,

493
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
so normally,

494
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
on a short day show,

495
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
short show day,

496
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I would be winding up right about now.

497
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And now,

498
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I am,

499
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
well,

500
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
not even halfway through,

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
so this is going to be interesting.

502
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm going to shut up now,

503
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and play some feedback that I got from,

504
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
from my body over at exit 50.

505
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I,

506
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think you'll enjoy this.

507
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Adam Curry.

508
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yo, man.

509
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
This is Andrew Coffee.

510
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You know me from exit 50.

511
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
How are you doing?

512
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
By the way,

513
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
he's from,

514
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Adam Curry.

515
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oops.

516
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, that's a rewind,

517
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
didn't know that.

518
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He's a Jersey guy.

519
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So that's kind of,

520
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
this is how Jersey guys talk to each other.

521
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This is Andrew Coffee.

522
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You know me from exit 50.

523
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How are you doing?

524
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm doing.

525
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I was going to email you this,

526
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
but I figured,

527
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
you know,

528
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't feel like typing.

529
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I figured it's in your MP3 file.

530
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Right now.

531
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Hey,

532
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
that news you've put out on skip the calendar today,

533
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Derek.

534
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Man, it just tripped me out.

535
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I was driving home.

536
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It was Friday.

537
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And,

538
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
kind of,

539
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
this is kind of weird story,

540
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
because you're from Jersey and I'm from Jersey.

541
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah.

542
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And I go down to Stone Harbor,

543
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and have a line every year.

544
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And I actually know Derek's dad,

545
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
but that's,

546
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it was only after I did the interview on podcast 401 that I,

547
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
he called me,

548
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
he email me,

549
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
he says,

550
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Hey,

551
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
you're from Stone Harbor.

552
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's like we grew up together,

553
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but we didn't know each other.

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So just briefly,

555
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
what he's referring to here is Derek

556
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
from the skepticality podcast,

557
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
who was now in a drug-induced coma

558
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
after a form of brain aneurysm that has,

559
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
you know,

560
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
lots of people know each other in the podcast and community.

561
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So,

562
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
everyone's concerned and,

563
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and everyone's,

564
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you know,

565
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
start old,

566
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
if not,

567
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
shocked about this.

568
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Ah fuck.

569
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm so sorry.

570
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
How did that?

571
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't understand how that happened.

572
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
We'll see if I can,

573
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
oh,

574
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
man.

575
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
See if I can pick it up where we left off.

576
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
See if that'll work.

577
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh,

578
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
this really sucks.

579
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hold on.

580
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ah,

581
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
this is eating into my time, too.

582
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's now is,

583
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
is Megasex stuck?

584
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What's going on?

585
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't tell me it's going to

586
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
start over at the beginning.

587
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Adam Curry.

588
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah.

589
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'll follow you on podcast 401 that I,

590
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
he called me,

591
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
he email me,

592
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
he says,

593
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
hey,

594
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
you're from Stone Harbor.

595
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's like we grew up together,

596
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
but we didn't know each other.

597
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And,

598
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
when I went into the bar this,

599
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
like last week,

600
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
over the Labor Day,

601
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I talked to his mom.

602
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
His mom knew who I wasn't going to know.

603
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I was like,

604
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
oh yeah,

605
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
my son was telling me about you,

606
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
because my cousin works at that bar.

607
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And the last day of summer,

608
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I was hanging out with Derek's dad.

609
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And we were sitting at the bar

610
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
during,

611
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
well,

612
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
well,

613
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
he was drinking too,

614
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
but he was turning me on to this towaka.

615
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And I said to him,

616
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I said,

617
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
do you know what's going on?

618
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So because I didn't realize that was his son.

619
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I said,

620
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
oh,

621
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
that's your son.

622
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I said,

623
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
okay,

624
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
okay,

625
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
this all makes sense now.

626
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So when you told me that today,

627
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and you said,

628
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
skip the counting,

629
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you said,

630
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Derek, I was like,

631
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
oh fuck.

632
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm just like,

633
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
man,

634
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the dad's so cool.

635
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He hooks me up with the local price,

636
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
because he knows my cousin works there,

637
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
you know,

638
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
everybody else has to pay more.

639
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So when you said that today,

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I was like,

641
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
fuck anyway.

642
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What,

643
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
fuck there goes my,

644
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
my cheap drinks.

645
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm hoping you would think it's something else.

646
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Enough of that.

647
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I hope he gets better.

648
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I know I'm going to see him.

649
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I never met the guy.

650
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I go,

651
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Even though I said,

652
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
dude,

653
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
you coming up down the shore.

654
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And,

655
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
anyway,

656
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I was going to start listening to a

657
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
shoggycemic.

658
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You know,

659
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I know I'm on other things.

660
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
We've got these parallel lies, man.

661
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm standing it in my upright desk like you.

662
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I've had mine longer than yours though.

663
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I use it for work when I'm a broker.

664
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But working with the street IQ.com,

665
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
they're flying me up to New York City next week,

666
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and I don't know if you've been checking out the site,

667
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,360
been checking out the site or what I'm

668
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,440
been doing, but we've got a pretty

669
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,080
ask kick and revenue model for a podcast

670
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,680
adventure here. It was already publicly

671
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,880
traded company. Sorry, I was downloading

672
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,200
porn instead. I've said this to you

673
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,880
million times in emails and like you said

674
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,800
today on the show, you don't fucking

675
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,200
return your emails. Hey, that's cool.

676
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,840
We're going to we'll meet sometime. I know

677
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,600
where we'll probably meet the first time

678
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,440
and that's going to be at the podcast

679
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,400
media expo because street IQ got that

680
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,640
award. Oh, that's right. There's no

681
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,040
word ceremony. I got to go to that. I really

682
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,880
want to go. I was in November, I think. To

683
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,840
give out. You are part of it. So I'm sure we're

684
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,280
going to hook up there, but I'd hopefully

685
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,520
look, we did, you know, I'm thinking about, you

686
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,280
know, going. Maybe you should take a whole bunch of

687
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,440
the pod squad and go have a good time.

688
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,880
And I don't know. I want to do something cool, though,

689
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,920
if if we do go to the podcast expo, you know, we

690
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,320
should do something cool. I'm not quite sure yet,

691
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
but we'll come up with some. You know,

692
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,680
mess some ideas between now and then. And I don't know

693
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,640
how we can integrate, you know, music to financial

694
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,800
content, but I got a pretty good take-home

695
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,000
what's a lot of money out there, you know, in the

696
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,360
financial arena. So anyway, contact me, get in touch with

697
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,360
me, Skype, whatever. I don't know what to fuck. Stay in touch.

698
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,760
Let me know. I'm going to New York next week. I just

699
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,080
missed you. Maybe I catch up with the in San

700
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,840
Francisco, whatever. Stay into the show. You look like

701
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,680
that pretty much put everything online. And

702
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,000
you have a good time over there and wherever you are,

703
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,440
England. Ciao, man. Oh, by the way, go to my site

704
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,960
to do the sound scene tour while with New Jersey.

705
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,680
I got some funny fuckers from South, South Philly on the

706
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,120
tape. Since you've grown up down there, you kind of know what's going on.

707
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,680
Yeah, we got along great. Anyway, yeah, you bummed me out there.

708
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,560
You fucker. Anyway, later. So he did make me smile with all that.

709
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,800
All right, let's get into some pod safe music here. This

710
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,200
one came in through email. It's actually already listed on the

711
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,120
pod safe music network. You can find that at

712
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,560
pod safe music network.com or music.podshow.com. It's the

713
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,720
stepford wives on the daily source code.

714
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

739
00:28:37,480 --> 00:29:07,480
I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flexing, I'm flex

741
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,280
For some reason, I had a real mashup quality to it, but it's PodSafe, my backpack and my Boss 2 tides, step for wives on the Daily Source Code.

742
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,040
you can find that in the show notes, of course, a daily source code.com or at

743
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,960
curry.com and they'll take you over to the podcast, music.network, music.podshow.com.

744
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,040
So I just, and that we have 10 minutes and 25 seconds left. I'm trying to time it into my

745
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,040
exact 40, 40 minutes. I had to make an executive decision, had to pull something out,

746
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,800
and I'm not going to tell you what it is, because I'll just put it back in tomorrow.

747
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:05,720
Hello, this is Chef Mark Tafoya from the remarkable Palette podcast. I'm a personal chef

748
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,600
in New York City, and my program is all about enjoying the pleasures of food, experiencing

749
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,600
the gastronomic delights of the world, and doing it in a relaxed and fun way. Join me as I explore

750
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,800
world cuisine, present some fun and interesting recipes, and experiment with new ingredients.

751
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,080
I also interview producers, perveires, and other food professionals, and talk about being a

752
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,960
personal chef. It's all part of my quest to develop a more remarkable palette.

753
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,840
You can find me on iTunes or read the blog at remarkablepalette.logspot.com, and there you'll find links to the

754
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:49,720
show. It's a tough world out there for a geek. It's hard to enjoy the various entertainment

755
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,600
mediums. Where's a geek to go when television is being over-branded by reality shows?

756
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,280
Where's a geek to go when they're on a limited budget, and it's hard to sort through the

757
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,480
crap that makes it to theaters? Where's a geek to go when he wants the latest and video game

758
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,360
information? Where's a geek to go when she wants the latest news, rumors, and facts at

759
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:14,440
for the entertainment world? If you suffer from public anxiety, mild depression, superior

760
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,320
complexes. You feel the need to sit in front of a computer or television screen for hours on

761
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,320
hand. Does your family and friends criticize you for your habits and hobbies? If so, chances are

762
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,280
you're a geek, playing in simple. Hi, I'm Randy McKinney, and I'm Wayne Porter. We are the hosts

763
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:39,480
of Geek Entertainment, and we are here for you. Fizz us on the web at www.geekshow.us for all your entertainment

764
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,240
needs. I got a place where geeks definitely want to go. You know, this show Rockstar,

765
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,640
which I think it is on CBS, I think. You're going to like this. There's a big controversy

766
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,160
brewing now, because one of the, let me see if I have that page open, one of the performers on

767
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:03,400
the show, who eventually the winner, of course, will become the new lead singer in excess. Let me

768
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,800
see what's this guy's name. I'm sure it's on this page. Of course, there's a link to this page.

769
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:17,400
From my show notes, shoot doesn't even say. Anyway, one of the candidates, and you'll see this

770
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:26,280
on this page, was wearing a shirt that looked like he had like congee, letters, 3 rows, 3 vertical

771
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,920
rows, and if you turn your head 90 degrees to the right or the picture 90 degrees to the left,

772
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:39,560
you'll see that the shirt actually says, go fuck yourself. It's a great, a great hack,

773
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,520
and they got away with it, because I guess that episode aired, I just thought it was fantastic. So

774
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:55,320
make sure you check that out. And also Rockstar, I mean, screw it. eBay, that's what I want to say.

775
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,080
eBay bought Skype. I just saw it press release about that. That's pretty interesting.

776
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,240
I can't wait to, you know, they say that it's a very natural fit for them. It doesn't matter.

777
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,280
Shoot, I like the service. I'll continue to use it as long as they continue to maintain it,

778
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,560
make it better, but I thought that was in shape. It's like $2.6 billion.

779
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,960
Okay, eBay is your new phone company, never bought it. And then some aviation stuff. And I have to

780
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,520
say it was great having iTunes kind of blow up on me over the weekend, because I really went searching

781
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:30,200
for all of my favorite podcasts. And I found a couple new ones. And there's even a stewardess now

782
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,560
who was doing a podcast, or a air hostess, or flight attendant, I guess I should say,

783
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:44,680
Betty in the sky with suit with the suitcase. I think it's called. And she is definitely affiliated

784
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,640
with the fly with me podcast, because, well, there's some overlap there. I don't know if they're

785
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:59,160
married or whatever. But Joe Dion does fly with me is a pilot or copilot for a major US carrier.

786
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,800
It is a great show. I want to talk about that in a second. But first reflecting back to

787
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,240
what we're talking about, the Cessna versus the Sirus. I know now we're talking about airplanes

788
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,920
all of a sudden. And I said that I really like the Cessna, which is the one I have, the 182

789
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,280
RG. And, you know, I like the Cirrus. It's pretty. But, you know, Todd really summed it up.

790
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,360
And email he says, Sirus may be a sexy modern plane, but the biggest problem I'm hearing from

791
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,080
other pilots that are looking to buy one is Sirus's longevity. The Sirus, you see, is a composite

792
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,240
airplane. It's value drops over time, whereas the Cessna is does not. I used to fly a 1957

793
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,560
Cessna 182, it mines a little bit younger than that. And almost none of the major components have

794
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,280
been replaced. That won't be true with the composite plane. I have flown the Katana and the

795
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,840
Sirus and the great planes. They just won't stand the test of time as well. A Sirus is

796
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,960
fun to fly for its modernness and sexiness. It's just not an investment. Now, that's all great.

797
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,520
But the important part of this comes at the end of the email. And that would really smidge

798
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,160
sway me if I were still in the market for a new aircraft. He says, I bagged my last girlfriend

799
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:10,600
in a Sirus. Picture up from work in it for a sunset flight. Regardless, Todd. Well, okay. He

800
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:18,680
is, he truly is a real pilot. Okay. And then the fly with me podcast. Oh, man, I'm not going

801
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:28,280
to be able to make this semi. Oh my goodness. The fly with me podcast is Joe Dion, who records

802
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:34,600
his colleagues, his flights, all kinds of stuff. And the most recent episode episode number eight

803
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,720
and you can find it from the show notes or from iTunes is all about danger and crashes. And

804
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,920
it's some really interesting stuff. And it may have been Betty. I can remember it was someone

805
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,760
who was talking about the about a hijacking to Cuba and how Fidel Castro came on board after the

806
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,320
hijacking and how they how they got everyone out of the plane. It's fascinating stuff to listen to

807
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,200
absolutely fascinating. And you really get a whole new respect for flight attendants because they

808
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,600
really are there for your safety. You know, they're there to make sure basically to save your

809
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:14,920
ass in the event of an emergency. And so they wind up talking about they wind up talking about

810
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,480
the air France plane that skidded off the runway and basically burst into flames that

811
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,560
everybody got out and how amazing that was and how they all sat and watched the TV coverage in

812
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,480
horror because, you know, they know exactly what's going on. And quite frankly, they were amazed

813
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,080
that everyone got out alive. And it really makes you realize when you listen to this podcast

814
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,920
that makes you realize just how important a job these flight attendants have. And, you know,

815
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,640
next time you're thinking that your drink isn't right or your meal was the wrong temperature or

816
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,240
whatever, you know, think about what they're really there for and they don't really get a

817
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:56,200
respect for their jobs anymore. I think it's, you know, people just don't realize what it is,

818
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,320
what their primary objective is. And it's really to keep you safe. And so there's a little bit

819
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,880
that I'm going to play now from the fly with me podcast, which is, it's kind of a mash up all on

820
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,920
its own, but it's just a little bit about about that plane evacuated. We evacuate airplanes every year.

821
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:19,240
Smoke filled cabins and fire blocked exits. By the way, I think in this case, they're talking about

822
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,400
their actual training. That's why they do it every single year, not that they have an accident

823
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,120
every year where they have to evacuate an airplane. So, I'm curious if like, you know, you're

824
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,000
looking at that as you see those pictures on TV, you're rehearsing it in your mind like what would

825
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:44,200
I be doing? Right. And you rehearse, rehearse, rehearse your exits. Thank you. And every circumstance

826
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,840
that could happen because it's always something different. Every time every crash, no crash is a lie.

827
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,880
Everyone's different. You just, you hope it's never going to happen to you, but.

828
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,160
Grab ankles, heads down, stay low, bend over, grab ankles, heads down, stay low, bend over,

829
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,400
grab ankles, get out, get out, get out, keep everything really steep out, get up, get out,

830
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,320
keep everything we keep out. Good exits, come this way, leave everything, arms straight ahead, jump

831
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,880
inside, leave everything, arms straight ahead, jump inside, good exit, come this way.

832
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,120
Ross and Nightmarish managed to listen to that it really is fantastic though and they do do a

833
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,600
fantastic job. Okay, so another executive decision, I guess we're not going to do the hit tasks.

834
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,640
I swear to myself, we make it 40 minutes a day and I have not done a good job of drop two

835
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,400
entire segments, which means my planning kind of sucks. And this immediately shows the disadvantage

836
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,720
of podcasting because I could go for the extra, what is the hit test is five minutes and 21 seconds

837
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,440
today. But I'm going to keep it, I'm going to use that tomorrow. I'll have less time tomorrow,

838
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:07,000
so I can still do a 40 minute show. The reason why I'm doing this is I'm ramping up, I'm practicing

839
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:14,360
because I want the pod show on serious, I want that to start replicating

840
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:22,040
some of what we're doing in the podcast space. So what that means is we're going to create the first

841
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:30,040
simulcast on satellite and podcast through the daily source code. And so that's why I'm trying

842
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:36,200
to get it down to either 20 minutes or 40 minutes. And it's going to be an interesting experiment,

843
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,760
but this is probably the final frontier for me, the final bit that I've been able to

844
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,120
to kind of finagle and shift and shape and form so that it works with podcasting is the concept

845
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:58,920
of, well, I actually do have to stop after 40 minutes. You know what? We'll leave it at that for today.

846
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,960
I still get to do the signature sign off, though. Stay subscribed.
