1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I want to be very much more than just any old girl

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I want all the people to look at me

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I want my own show on TV I want to be that girl

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I want to be famous, eat out at sardies, hard parties, that's fine

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be famous, go to Paris on private flights

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to have lovers buy the score

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Movie producers knocking down on my door

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the fate that is in store for me

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh and I'm famous, I will wear a great trench coat and fake red hair

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So they all will know that it is me

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
When they see me, how they'll smile

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And me photo grass to sign

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will say sorry babe

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Talk to my assistant

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids will bring what I eat

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want to be famous, who I do will be news on the streets

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then when I'm old, I'll have a ball

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There'll be shocked that I'm living at home

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
When I enter the gas, we'll fall to the knees

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And then I'll stand the throats of my enemies

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But all I don't want one in cheese when I'm famous

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Spameless, famous, famous

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So exhausting

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,040
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I want to be famous, stayed my tabloids

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to be famous, stay my tabloids

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I go that imagine I'll be

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When I'm famous, not I will give

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For the little people, I'll never give

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
When I'm famous, I'm famous

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm famous, I'm famous

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm famous, I'm famous

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Olivia's Bitties, get lucky

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Famous at the start of

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Daily Source Code for this

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What are we adding now?

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thursday coming to you from Northern California

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
from Curricondo

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I was a lovely little angel who whispered

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
in my ear that the song was now available

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
on the pod safe music network.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That of course was

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Leon Westover who shot me

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Little email

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's just about a year ago

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that this whole pod safe music thing

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
kind of came into view

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
When I found this song

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
by the Lassivius Bitties

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I found from the site I believe

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and I shot him an email

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and wound up at Leon Westover

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
in her inbox

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that sounded wrong

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and I said, can I play this

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
on my pod cast

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, yeah, we call it a pod cast

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
by them. She said, sure

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and I played it and then other people

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
jumped on it and loved it and played it

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and they started selling records

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and man, it seems like

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
they've been on the road

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
nonstop since then

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and now this song

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
in addition to Betty

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is available on the pod safe music network

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
music.podshow.com

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They've also got their own...

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry, I'm storing my words

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Once again, it's a very early Thursday morning

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
they also have their own pod cast

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the Bittie cast

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
so you can check that at Bittiecast.com

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What a day

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I gotta tell you, I am completely wrecked

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm so tired

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know, I just never got around

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that's my tea

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No sense sale here in the condo

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
got the tea going

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I never got around to getting

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
turned around from the jet lag

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and I'm almost on my way back

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and see we have today

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and then Friday

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Friday evening

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
we have our first annual

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
podshow Christmas party

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
which is just for the folks at the office

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
which by the way is now

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
almost 22, 23 people

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Gosh, it's just unbelievable

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and we had our board of directors meeting today

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
on Sandhill Road

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
with our investment partners

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and it was

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
we had a lot of fun

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll tell you, throughout the show

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll take a couple of anecdotes

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
from the meeting

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
but it was great once again

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
to the same table with some of the most powerful men

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and to look on that

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
maybe feel really good

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's see

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Jo Dion

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You may now call him Captain Jo Dion

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I got a little update pod cast

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
if you've never heard fly with me

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you definitely have to listen to this pod cast

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Jo flies for a major airline

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think he does a lot of trips to Hawaii

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
still

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
like it would be wrong

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
usually from LAX

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and he

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
records

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
but not just what's going on in the cockpit

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
but he really does interviews

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
with

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
with

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Stewartuses Stewart

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
or just a flight attendants

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
his own colleagues up on the flight deck

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and he

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
in his update

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
which is a short two-minute little pod cast

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
he said that he has passed his check ride

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and he now can officially sit in the left hand seat

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and call himself Captain Jo Dion

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Congratulations, dude

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I know what that feels like

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The question is

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
when you do a check ride like that

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
do you actually

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
fly a real plane

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
it's not really expensive to do a check ride

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and what do you guys fly seven

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think he flies seven forty-seven

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
or do you do that in a simulator

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
as I could have expected

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
plenty of feedback

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
on

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Trinity

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
my wonderful biodiesel beast

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and I just want to share a couple of these different

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
different pieces of email that I got

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
outrageously informative

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
as first one is from Thomas

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and he says of course that

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
he heard the pod cast

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and he

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I see what is he

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
he is a

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
for some reason I thought he knew all about

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
he had a reason for knowing all about this stuff

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
anyway he sent me a whole bunch of different links about

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
biodiesel

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll just name him real quickly

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
you'll find him in the show notes if you go to

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
daily source code dot com or show notes dot info

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
he has biodiesel dot org of course

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
biodiesel america dot org

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
veggie van dot org

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and Joshua tickle

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
ck and e double l dot com

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and he sent another link here anyway

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
he says he's been running biodiesel

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
in his 2000 Volkswagen

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
since 2000 now here comes

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
the info that he sent along that I wanted to share with you

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
he says biodiesel

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
because you know really

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
understanding what this stuff is and the difference between

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
vegetable oil and biodiesel and

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you know being 99

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
biodiesel is a product called

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
methylesters

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
derived by reacting vegetable oil with

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
these are also known as potash or lie

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and lastly an alcohol like ethanol or methanol

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
as a catalyst the chemical process from

201
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
making biodiesel is exactly the same as

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
making soap which is called

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
saponification

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but you terminate the reaction before you get

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
soap uh-huh makes sense this is part of the reason

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
the biodiesel has a mild solvent action and usually

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
cleans your fuel system

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
okay Joshua tickle whose website is above

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
wrote an excellent book many years ago called

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
from the fryer to the fuel tank and you can still

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
buy it from him explains the whole process of

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
making biodiesel in detail

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
interesting okay

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
so I'll make sure that some of that shows up in the

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
show notes and again besides

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Michael of course who's who maintains his whole

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
show notes dot info I really

218
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
appreciate the show notes

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Wiki system so much

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the contributions that are being made there

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
on every single show is just it's really good

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and actually Ron and I were talking

223
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
we uh we had a quick drink after uh

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
uh was after four I hope

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and I was after like seven o'clock

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
or something like that and we were thinking about

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you know what is this you know what can we do

228
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
what else can we do with show notes you know we've

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
already

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
seen quite an amazing thing happened here with

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
these collaborative show notes and so we're

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
thinking about more ideas and if you have any

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
of course I'd love to hear from you

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
David Patrick

235
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
check this out

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
he sent me a link

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
apparently

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
uh this coming's racing dot com

239
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
god this is great come it I'm sorry

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
come in's racing double M

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
a 170 mile per hour dragster running on

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
biodiesel

243
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
also look out for oddies new diesel race car

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
planning to race at Le Mans that's a 24 hour race

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
next year alongside another biodiesel

246
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
engine car this stuff it's happening it really

247
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
is it's so amazing just not to be

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
dependent upon upon the petrochemical

249
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
industries so incredibly nice

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
alright one more thing that I just wanted

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
hit from the feedback because it's been so

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
much reaction I mean this is just a small

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
sample of all the email that I received

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
about uh shaving

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
so if you're just tuning into this to the

256
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
podcast or if you're listening to us for the

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
first time in serious satellite stars

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
103

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
um I just said you know what are you using

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
what kind of razor are you using and why

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and how long is it last

262
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and apparently what I'm stumbling onto here

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
is that blades don't really get

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
dollar the more you use them yet they

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
dollar at a certain point

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
but you can use them for a long time

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and they will still be effective at least

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that's what some of the your fellow source

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
code listeners are saying

270
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Steve Harlow says my experiences that a single

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
blade disposable big razor will last about a year

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
after a few weeks it isn't as sharp as it

273
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
wasn't first but it stays about the same

274
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
for months and months I like it that way

275
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
best eventually however it doesn't seem to

276
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
cut anything anymore well yeah it doesn't

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
mean that okay but still a year

278
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I bought a bag of a dozen raises for five

279
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
bucks five years ago I still got several

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
just depends on how close you want the

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
shave and how thick your beard is that doesn't

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
make any sense how does that work

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I mean I think they just

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
are they just putting us on with all this

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
stuff

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Trevor says that when he was taking

287
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
mechanical engineering classes at Penn State

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
one of his professors told him that the

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
hardness of a razor blade is much harder than

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the hair on our face so theoretically

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
our hair would not make the blade dull he says

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the reason a blade goes dull is because it

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
oxidizes which of course is rust

294
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you may not see the rust but it causes small

295
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
pits and roughness in the edges of the

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
razor if you were able to look on a

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
microstope you'll be able to see the pits

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
so if there was a way to prevent it from

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
rusting you might be able to keep the

300
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
razor blade longer hey man I didn't use to

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
think that that little strip that you know

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
that blue strip on the razor that once

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that was kind of gone and white there was

304
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
time to throw it out I think this is

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I think we've been bullshit all along

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Alan Wages says that I'm a lifetime

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Gillette user the original sensor came out

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
right around when I started shaving as a

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
teenager and I think I've used every

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
gelette model since once after I switched

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the mock three I went back and tried

312
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the sensor and there was no going back again

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
but a year ago I started using the M3

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
power it's fantastic I get about eight to ten

315
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
shades from each carches is that the

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
one that has the the hell is that the

317
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
M3 power is that the three

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
blade with a motor in it or something like that

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've read so I got to collect all of these

320
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
things and I'll just really flesh them out

321
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and one big show I think someone else

322
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
was saying that he still uses a straight

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
razor it's pretty amazing and what

324
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
it's a billion dollar business by

325
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the way it's unbelievable so I

326
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
have a big complaint for a fellow podcaster

327
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I've said it to him privately

328
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and now I want to say it publicly

329
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
because I really want to turn up the

330
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
pressure on this guy because he's

331
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
well he's done really a bad thing

332
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
once you get your audience hooked

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you just cannot pull the needle out of the

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
main line I'm talking about the daily download

335
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Chris Rockwell who works at pod show full

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
time has not done a daily download

337
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
poop cast for over two months

338
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and I for one am severely severely disappointed

339
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
to let this be a call for all pod casters

340
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to get Chris Rockwell to drop a low

341
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
some people go on smoke breaks

342
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
others surf the web

343
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
some people get up and grab a coffee

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
but I'm not one of them

345
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't like being a net

346
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and all I smoke is grass

347
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I've heard a spend my time sitting on my skinny white ass

348
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I've read some lies all around the room

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
just right before I start

350
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
sometimes I'm in there for 30 minutes

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and all I do is fart

352
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
so if the facts machines on the fritz

353
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and that'll cop here is going berserk

354
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
don't ask me to play Mr. Repairman

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
when I'm taking a dog at work

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
oh I'm taking a dog

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm taking a dog

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm taking a dog at work

359
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't bother me

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
because I'm taking a dog at work

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I go in a round of left

362
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and a clock

363
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I go back in after lunch

364
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
every time it comes out right on the dam

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and it looks like a nestle crunch

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and I'm afraid to you

367
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
who's the Johnny

368
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
but that's all my floor

369
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
there'll be a 10 minute layover

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
before it almost shit up with the door

371
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm taking a dog

372
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
but taking a dog

373
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
but taking a dog at work

374
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't bother me

375
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you can't see

376
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm just taking a dog at work

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and if I'm not in my disc

378
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll be on the porch of the throne

379
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll waste my day on the crapper

380
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
until this time to go home

381
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I do talk to me

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
through the storm

383
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and you break my concentration

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
the last thing that I need right now

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
is a case of constipation

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and I'm a fan of the courtesy flush

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I like my ass tape

388
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
a three-plot thick

389
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you know I sat on the shit of this afternoon

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and read mail bills won't be a dick

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
twice

392
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
so you can call me Ishmael Bitch

393
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
when I'm taking a dog

394
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
but taking a dog

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but taking a dog

396
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
it won't even

397
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't bother me

398
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
you can't see him

399
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
just taking a dog at work

400
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't care

401
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the boss is looking

402
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't care

403
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the phone is ringing

404
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll be in here

405
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
dropping a news

406
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and you'll probably hear me singing

407
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
that I'm taking a dog

408
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
we're taking a dog

409
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
we're taking a dog

410
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
we're taking a dog

411
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
we're going

412
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
we don't bother me

413
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
you can't see him

414
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
just taking a dog

415
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
bad boy

416
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,640
oh

417
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,680
I'm roundin' down

418
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,360
I'm roundin'

419
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,080
he's puffin' his head

420
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,080
and then there's cool back here

421
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
oh

422
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,280
hhh

423
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,320
oh

424
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,640
no

425
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,200
dammit and you're real

426
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,620
ONA

427
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,320
terminus

428
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,760
so the next time you're in your office

429
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
and your stomach starts to jerk

430
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,720
get out of your chair and drop

431
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,720
And take you and don't let you leave.

432
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Stucky and Murray, taking a dump at work with my special plea to Chris Rockwell to get back to podcasting, please.

433
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Dude, don't you want to quit your day job?

434
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Got that song off of the comedy section of the Podsake Music Network.

435
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,720
And if you look through it, this is something I didn't know.

436
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Lots of comedians are uploading their entire routines.

437
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:18,720
It's not very, I mean, this song falls under or has been tagged as a comedy genre as well as some of these routines.

438
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
So that's not really an efficient way of finding them, but they are there.

439
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,720
And it seems like, well, if we can get some comedians into podcasting, wouldn't that be nice?

440
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Man, what a forum for comedians.

441
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I don't know.

442
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,720
But to me, it's exactly the same as Podsake musicians.

443
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I think it could really help you in your career.

444
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Maybe not for selling comedy albums, but wow.

445
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
What a way to get some exposure and get some gigs.

446
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Of course, you'll have to keep the routine fresh if everyone can just download all your jokes.

447
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Let me see what else I was going to say about that.

448
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Now, okay. So after the Board of Directors meeting today, right there, there's a shopping mall,

449
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,720
which is, I don't know, was it the Palo Alto shopping mall.

450
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,720
It says really upscale stuff.

451
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,720
And Ron and I did a little bit of Christmas shopping for our spouses.

452
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
And of course, that meant that we spent a lot of time at Sharper Image.

453
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,720
And what I bought is a Tom Tom Go GPS Navigator for Trinity.

454
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,720
So officially now, the equipment inside the car is about 20% of the price of the entire automobile.

455
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,720
But it's great. And I'm really, really impressed with this Tom Tom Go, which I believe is built by a Dutch company.

456
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,720
I'm going to second I got my, I got my T here.

457
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,720
I think it's built by a Dutch company sold over the world, very, very successful.

458
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Touch screen, small, little unit has a battery, lithium battery inside.

459
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,720
You can plug it in a adapter into the cigarette lighter.

460
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,720
It has a regular power adapter.

461
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
You can put it in walking mode.

462
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,720
So it ignores all of the one-way streets.

463
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
So it knows that you're not in a car.

464
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
You're walking, you put it in a bicycle mode.

465
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
It's just really good.

466
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,720
It has multiple voices unbelievably sophisticated, very, very impressed with it.

467
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,720
And it boy, it looks great. It looks great.

468
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,720
It's, you know, snapped right onto Trinity's window there.

469
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
And so, of course, I had to test it out.

470
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,720
So this was a big trip for me.

471
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I, after work, I programmed in the nearest whole foods location and drove her over.

472
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
And was able to get a lot of the stuff that I really didn't have.

473
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,720
I needed some brooms, you know, but also wanted to get just some regular groceries.

474
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Oh, you know what I found?

475
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Oh, man, I'm so happy.

476
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,720
My wife, Patricia will be so jealous.

477
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,720
I found Eggnog, which, of course, I only have recently come to understand, is not available

478
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,720
in the United Kingdom, or at least not readily available as it is here in the States.

479
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,720
And I got back and I had a nice, you know, cup of Eggnog.

480
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Even though it was, you know, it's store bought.

481
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
And there's no alcohol on it.

482
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
It's still, it had that taste to it.

483
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
You know, it was really, really cool.

484
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,720
And just one more thing here about a pod save for peace.

485
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,720
I got beginning a lot of email back and forth over the past two days from Slaw.

486
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Westwood 1, not only debuted the song on their network.

487
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
That's the Westwood 1 radio network.

488
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
But they're also putting it into rotation on their 24 hour day holiday programming.

489
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,720
So this includes 65 stations, as well as the armed forces network.

490
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Let's see, Mike Tanner Westwood 1, heard, heard Slaw on Marilana's ACB radio show.

491
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
And immediately wanted to get a copy.

492
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
So it was FedEx and Boom.

493
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
There you go.

494
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,720
So as, as hoped, it's now getting play outside of the pod casting arena, which is great,

495
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,720
because it can show what pod safe music is all about.

496
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
It can get people interested in pod casting.

497
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,720
And ASCAP performance royalties will go to UNICEF.

498
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,720
And of course, people can buy the song at podsaferepiece.org.

499
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
And in our board of directors meeting today.

500
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Yeah, I didn't mean that we were somewhere between infrastructure and finance.

501
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,720
I can't remember what, you know, what we were discussing at the time.

502
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,720
And then Ray Lane, who was really, I'd have to say, the lead partner from Kleiner Perkins

503
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
from our investment team.

504
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,720
He said, you know, I just guys, have you heard this?

505
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
He called it a Christmas mashup.

506
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,720
And so I didn't quite get what he was talking about at first.

507
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,720
You know, all these, these pod safe music artists.

508
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
And he had heard it.

509
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
He had purchased the song.

510
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,720
And he was turning all the people in the room onto it.

511
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
And he was so, so nuts about the idea.

512
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
And I hadn't told them about it.

513
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
I hadn't sent it to him or tip them off to it.

514
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
He had just found it.

515
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,720
I know he listens to a whole bunch of podcasts.

516
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,720
He may have heard it through the daily source code, but more likely through something else,

517
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
because he definitely serves around a lot.

518
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,720
But that really, it just, you know, like, whoa, it kind of gave me a little chill there.

519
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,720
You know, something really, really working across boundaries to what you normally think would be

520
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
some pretty boring people, which they're not.

521
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
The way switch done.

522
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,720
If you're listening to this show on a serious stars 103 on serious satellite radio,

523
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,720
coming up next in the pod show lineup.

524
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,720
We've got from the pod squad, Pacific Coast, Hellway, followed by yeast radio, then Dawn and Drew.

525
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,720
PW Fenton fills in the next half hour with something.

526
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
It's always a surprise.

527
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
And I never know beforehand what he's going to do.

528
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,720
And then, of course, we got more pod safe music to round out the hour.

529
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,720
We do it every single day from 6 to 10 Eastern, from 3 to 7 Pacific on stars 103.

530
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,720
And if you want to hear more of the daily source code, well, then really what you should be doing is

531
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,720
subscribing to the podcast, downloading it, because the satellite window is closing,

532
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
and the people who listen to the podcast.

533
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Well, they get all the extra bits.

534
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Man, that blue chunks.

535
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Hi.

536
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Are you looking for a heart?

537
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Do you need wild podcap?

538
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
This one has it all.

539
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Three sums?

540
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Four sums?

541
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,720
One episode even had a six sum, and you never know who's going to pair up together.

542
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Everyone here is a player.

543
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,720
These people go at it late into the night, and cubby even pulled a 24 hour marathon.

544
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Here, the women are looking for pole.

545
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,720
And the men are looking to stick it in the hole with this little effort as possible.

546
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,720
This podcast is all about banging, getting it in the back door, and sometimes playing

547
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
with yourself.

548
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Everyone here is looking to score.

549
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
How can this podcast be suitable for all agents?

550
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Well, we're not talking about sex here.

551
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
We're talking about disc golf.

552
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,720
We're the players throw their frisbee at a pole, banging the cane, and deflecting the

553
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
disc into the basket to finish the hole.

554
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,720
There won't be any sex in this podcast, but it's all about passion.

555
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,720
So listen to cubby's disc golf world podcast, and check out all the actions.

556
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I don't know about you, but this is getting me hot.

557
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720

Okay.

So without further ado.

604
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Yeah.

605
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
A promo.

606
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,720
So give me a more fun.

607
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
For like seven.

608
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
I've got a whole sitting next to me.

609
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720

I am the man for you.

614
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Hot music.

615
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
I told you we love hot kids.

616
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
And hot accents.

617
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I'm not Australian.

618
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,720
I don't want these because this is how Australian Thor.

619
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Brought to you once a week, every week.

620
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Congenio.

621
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Yeah.

622
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah.

623
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Nick and Jay and Jay.

624
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Yeah.

625
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
And Jay and the spell.

626
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Jay.

627
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Hey.

628
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Yeah.

629
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
It's mad down the door.

630
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
It's a big quiet.

631
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
And now.

632
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
And back to the Daily Source Code.

633
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Ah.

634
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Spallion.

635
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
I love like.

636
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
So what I'm trying to do with this new format.

637
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:07,720
We're I'm only doing a 24 minutes and 30 seconds for that'll be in the serious satellite window.

638
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
And by the way, I yielded the rest of my time.

639
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,720
The other half of my time to the distinguished gentle woman from Chicago.

640
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
I had to find steam.

641
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
She's not doing an hour.

642
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
She was, oh man.

643
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
She was complaining.

644
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
So that's so much about that.

645
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
You know, I wish we had more time and serious.

646
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,720
There's so many more shows I'd like to put on.

647
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Well, working on it.

648
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Okay.

649
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
So far, they're repeating the shows in the morning.

650
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
From six to ten Eastern AM.

651
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,720
But of course, it's the shows from the day before.

652
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,720
And I'd much rather create fresh shows in the morning and have fresh shows in the afternoon.

653
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
I mean, what else do they have on the channel?

654
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Because it doesn't go across the cousin Brucey.

655
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Come on.

656
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,720
That by the way, the of the three questions, there's only three main inquiries that people have when

657
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
they call up serious.

658
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,720
One last second.

659
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:02,720
And it's questions about Howard Stern about the Pod Show and about cousin Brucey.

660
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,720
I don't know if it's in that order.

661
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I don't know if it's good, better and different.

662
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
But that's the truth.

663
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,000
Yesterday I was wondering where the ultimate mix pod cast went and

664
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,860
You know, this is the guy who does a podcast that ultimately makes dot blogs spot.com

665
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,720
Which is the ultimate mix. It's like a weekly show of pod safe music

666
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,160
I really like listening to other podcasts to pick up on cool pod safe music

667
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,440
And so what usually what I do is I do a run of a couple of shows that I like I look at that on the PMM

668
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,040
And otherwise I'll just refresh the home page a couple of times and usually the songs that show up there

669
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,760
I've been played at least once on a podcast. I'll check those out

670
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,560
But I do like listening to the ultimate mix and right there on his home page

671
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,560
It said no podcast. I'm sick. Sorry everyone. No podcast this week

672
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm on my back enjoying the flu. Hopefully I can squeeze two in the next week

673
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
All right, dude. Hope you feel better for sure

674
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,080
So the new format. I'm trying to put together here for the source code

675
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,720
It's had that first you know the first kind of like 15 20 25 minutes have that be you know much more kind of you know

676
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,760
Stuff that I've been doing in source code like stuff

677
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:24,400
Or human source code like stuff and then once the satellite window closes is really where I want to focus a lot of the pod casting stuff

678
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,280
Because that way you know a lot of new listeners coming into this space

679
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,680
They'll probably want to know about what's going on with pod casting

680
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,720
But you know you really want to get some feel for pod cast as well

681
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,360
So that's kind of what I did yesterday with Trinity, you know first I did all the biodiesel stuff and then we talked about

682
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,720
What other stuff is going on in the podcast industry

683
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,080
Because I know there's still lots of pod casters who

684
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,240
who check out the show and

685
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:56,800
The pod pimp Aaron Brousel from pod show sent over an email that I just got it's I sent a link to a survey

686
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Which was done amongst podcasters

687
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,600
According to the link survey results described in this story 40% of podcasters

688
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:16,440
Have monetization in mind and excerpt almost two fifths of people producing video blogs and podcasts are doing so with some sort of commercial motive according to the study

689
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,240
The study was based on two surveys of 351 mostly US based podcasters and video bloggers and

690
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,400
Found that nearly 40% were producing the content with an explicit or quasi commercial motive in mind

691
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,320
Dr. Peter Chen and

692
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,720
Assistant lecturer in media at Monash University and author the pod casting and video blogging

693
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,240
Oh an author of pod casting a video blogging a production site analysis study

694
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:50,320
Says that while he found the result surprising it should be qualified in the sense that most producers probably didn't expect the podcasters video blogs to provide a

695
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
substantial income

696
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Interesting, okay

697
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:02,040
I will put the link to that in the daily source code show notes, so it can be copied over to the to the wiki show notes

698
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,520
I know it wasn't me see 351. Well, oh man, I could argue forever about stats, but

699
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,800
Is that a good sample of 10,000 is so two so they did 700?

700
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,520
Well, they almost did 10% of the registered podcasters if you if you take like a

701
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,560
As less than that is probably because of what we have now at podcast alley 11 12,000 13,000 so

702
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,720
Probably more like seven eight percent, but still very very interesting

703
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:38,040
And thanks to the miracle of pod casting. I'm actually I want to play this because in the future some day we're going to be able to

704
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,800
Use pieces or be able to refer back to pieces in podcast that'll be I think become relevant

705
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,360
Maybe I should put this up on the web somewhere else or

706
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,920
Maybe Pete the Mac geek can do it for me because it for the first time

707
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:01,480
He really gave me a great step-by-step analysis of my Macintosh hard drive now. This is like a three-minute geeky piece

708
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,000
So if you're not into you know how to fix a Mac hard drive when it crashes and what steps to take

709
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Please please just shuttle right past the next three minutes and seven seconds

710
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:20,680
I think you mentioned your upstairs Macintosh again during a DSC 298 and I thought I'd finally go for my fat ass and come and see me some audio feedback

711
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,920
You'll have to excuse the audio quality. I'm using the built-in mic on my laptop

712
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,440
Maybe you could pipe my audio through that fancy compressor eels

713
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,040
Anyway, Adam, I heard you mentioned you really want to recover the data from that drive so I thought I'd give you a yellow

714
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,240
You see I spent my days working as a technician at an Apple server center down here in New Zealand

715
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,760
I've had to recover data from many a host drive over my time and I thought I'd throw on a quick one-minute run-down on the steps

716
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,200
I go through and the hope it might be useful to you or one-year DSC listeners

717
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,960
First of all, you need to determine if the drive has suffered a harm to your failure or a software failure

718
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,800
But software, I mean the make-up of the data on the hard drive to retry structure

719
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,480
There are two possible types of harm to your failure from our perspective

720
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,760
Mechanical failure or controllable failure. If the drive makes loud clunky noises other than the normal

721
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,800
Sort of power on self-test start-up noises then this most likely indicates a mechanical assembly failure

722
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,920
A complete lack of spin-up also indicates a mechanical assembly failure

723
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,200
Although sometimes the symptom can also be caused by a controllable failure

724
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,640
If the drive spins up okay, but doesn't sharpen disc utility when you look for it

725
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,200
Then you most likely have a controllable portfolio

726
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,840
Controllable failures are far less common than the mechanical assembly failures, but they do happen

727
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,720
I've got a stack of six good quantum drives that work that have all had the exact same chip fail

728
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
And they've all got a boom mark on them to prove it

729
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,000
If the drive spins up okay, and you can see it in disc utility

730
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,680
But it doesn't mount on the finder

731
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,920
Adam, this is you from what you've told me

732
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,560
Then you most likely have a corrupt retry structure

733
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,800
That's a software failure and not a hardware failure

734
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,960
Great, so now you know how to distinguish them how can you fix them

735
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,120
Well, the mechanical assembly failure is by far the worst failure of the lot when it comes to repairing the drive yourself

736
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,040
Usually there's a little hope although sometimes a drive will stay out long enough for you to mount it and copy the most important data

737
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
I your users folder

738
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,320
One trick that is worked in the past is to stick the drive in a fridge

739
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,640
Adam, I heard you're mentioning a freezer once

740
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,280
But I've definitely had better results just using the fridge

741
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,840
Leave it in there for at least a day so that it can chill properly though

742
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,960
And mechanical failure that you can't recover from will probably have to be sent away to a special

743
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Sorganisation like drive savers

744
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,040
Who although expensive are generally do have excellent results

745
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:42,040
If you have a controller board failure, you'll need to find another drive of the exact same make and model with a good working board that you can borrow to put onto your drive to get your data off

746
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,800
You literally remove the board from the good drive put it onto your mechanical assembly

747
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,360
This is why it's good practice for technicians to keep the controller boards from failed drives that they've obtained over time and

748
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,440
Case that I've used to somebody else later

749
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,680
And finally if you have a corrupt directory structure, then I'd have to agree with Kurt Lewis the best tool for me

750
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
I was tending to retrieve recovery as dyskoria

751
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,840
Not and doesn't need as he puts it suck the sweat off right not so russes testicles

752
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,960
Well, I hope there'll be a few of you still have you holidays and keep the DSC's coming

753
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:24,280
You know, it turns out apples are pretty cool companies still isn't it?

754
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,200
I mean they got guys in New Zealand who are sticking power books and fridges and sparking up

755
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:37,160
Yeah, that's the company. I remember you got it and wind it up. What to do with Michael can be butchers

756
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
There's they dealt this year at Charlie

757
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:54,200
She was there studying abroad. He was on tour playing in another time

758
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,720
They potted hard and they potted wings

759
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
A little north of the sand

760
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,800
He dreamed about her in so many ways

761
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,320
She dreamed about her in France

762
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,960
Well, she knows what to do with Michael

763
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,760
She knows how to make him feel

764
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,560
That he's the one he's mother son

765
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,040
Not like anyone just needs time to heal

766
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,920
They met in New York a few months later

767
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
He was still living alone

768
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Hugging the ball in masturbating

769
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Never answer it's fun

770
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,040
Death first date was a movie together

771
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Outside it Brian Pock

772
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,280
In the spirit I've seen Louis just went on forever

773
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,640
Till they drank wine until they saw scars

774
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,280
Well, she knows what to do with Michael

775
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,600
She knows how to make him feel

776
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,640
That he's the one he's mother son

777
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,360
Not like anyone just needs time to heal

778
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:50,840
They finally hooked up for the first time

779
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,560
The night before the Fourth of July

780
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,440
He felt so awkward saying goodbye to the girl who just changed his life

781
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,080
Now my friend they are in separate ball

782
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,280
She even gets that boy to go to the gym

783
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,480
Now if you don't think that's love you must be cynical

784
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,080
Oh, maybe man you're just dreaming in France

785
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,880
Yeah, because she knows what to do with Michael

786
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,880
She knows how to make him feel

787
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,840
That he's the one he's mother son

788
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,880
Not like anyone just needs time to heal

789
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,600
Well, she knows what to do with Michael

790
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,600
She knows how to make him feel

791
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,560
That he's the one he's mother son

792
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,760
Not like anyone just needs time to heal

793
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,120
Yeah, he's the one he's mother son

794
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,760
Not like anyone just needs time to heal

795
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,200
Well, that's right. He just needs a time to heal

796
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,400
Big bad hell this one would have been one you'd love

797
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,800
Just listening that song and there's this legendary radio guy in Holland out Alfred look harder

798
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,920
And anyone who is in the Netherlands who knows him will know exactly what I'm talking about

799
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,600
He would have loved this song. He would have I know he would have he passed away

800
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,920
Oh, man what about five years ago five six years ago

801
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,040
He was only 50 but he was he was the oh, and he was not

802
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,560
That's what he was

803
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,720
What amazed he lasted until 50 but still I really really do miss him and hearing that song kind of brought some some good memories back

804
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,440
That's it for the daily source code for today daily source code dot com adamant curry dot com for the feedback

805
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,480
Kind of just say one more time now that I'm at 96% of my four gigs on go on Gmail and I really love Gmail

806
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,160
I know I can get more space anywhere else, but please put your feedback on a server and just send me a link

807
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,920
Okay, I'll be back tomorrow with the thank god it's Friday edition of Delta Sierra Charlie

808
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,760
Another pop show podcast stick it in your ear
