1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
source code for January 17th, 2005.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,920
Transmators, we don't need no stinking transmators.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,920
And good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,920
Hi everybody, welcome to the day of the source code coming to you once again from

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,480
Curry Cottage in in the affluence.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,920
Suray, suburb, cold gulfed.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,600
It's the start of a new week and we've got a lot of

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,000
lots of stuff to talk about on the source code.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,880
All podcasts related of most of those.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,080
Well, a new start, a new way to kick off the source code.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
I've been receiving lots of emails from people.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,040
Now is more and more people are coming online and enjoying podcasts.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,080
It seems that the ID3 tags just aren't enough when searching through

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,720
whatever messed up playlist system your particular MP3 player might have.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,440
So the request was, could you just start off by giving a little identification tag so that when someone hits

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,120
the play button, they know exactly which source code they're listening to.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,600
Okay, fair enough, January 17th, 2003.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:24,160
I keep forgetting that when you got headphones on, you can't take your glasses off because you

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,520
never get a background again.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,560
Okay, there we go.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,760
All right, 40 minutes approximately that is of all the latest goings on in the podcast

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,960
land and lots of responses to the previous podcast from last week.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,320
The first thing I really want to talk about is the amount of response I got about my

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,360
easy jet experience traveling with Egypt.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,480
In fact, I'm about to book another easy jet trip for this week to the Netherlands to do a couple

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,240
of a couple of meetings.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,120
David Burgess said that he had a similar easy jet experience and he said polite, efficient,

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,120
orderly, although the playing was smaller than the Airbus 319 on the one that I flew on.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,760
But I think this is, oh, he goes to this whole story about how people brought their own

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,600
champagne on board and how the students were all kind of cool with it and how the other

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,720
passengers were cool with it.

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,480
All of these, of course, in the production show, it's OPML file, which I'm thinking about

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,080
actually posting these in the blog post itself when I create the entry for Eves New Daily

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,600
source code.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,880
Just probably need to format a little bit differently or polish it up so it doesn't look

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,480
so crappy on a web page.

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
But otherwise, you'll be able to get to all of those comments.

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
That's a really good one.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,240
That's why I posted it up there.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,600
Just been trolling through my iPod, I spent most of the weekend downloading stuff.

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Of course, downloading automatically, transferring it to my I-River.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,720
I got to tell you, I am completely an I-River guy now.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
For some reason, it's just, it works better for me than the iPod.

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,720
It certainly is nicer because I have the old iPod, not the mini.

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,760
God forbid, not the micro or the, no, what was it?

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
It's the shuffle.

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
That's right.

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,360
David Letterman had a bit that I saw last night.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,640
He had this little itsy bitsy, like an inch high by an inch wide mock-up of kind of like

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,400
the iPod shuffle and he said, look, Paul, this is the iPod micro.

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
It's like, yeah, exactly.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,600
One podcast, even, that would be perfect, wouldn't it?

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,880
It's time once again for America's favorite radio show, the radio and such a subduct of Floyd,

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,440
brought to you by ductafloey.com.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,480
This week, we join our heroes as a screen through time and space.

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Yeah, you just don't get radio like that anymore, do you?

57
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,880
We were talking about Kennedy, the VJ.

58
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:09,400
On my last sounding tour down to Starbucks at Gilford and Matthew Bishop, of course, quite

59
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,480
active in the podcast community, checked in, he said, thought like, you know, that former

60
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,880
MTV VJ Kennedy now hosts the game show network show, friends or foe, yeah, well, she probably

61
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,880
has about the same amount of viewers as I have listeners to the source code, so we wish

62
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
her well.

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,880
It's just never was one of my favorite people, Kennedy.

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,400
God, gosh, we got so much to go through.

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,320
I have so many different sound clips and so many different things I want to talk about,

66
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,240
particularly about the sound seeing tour, because people are really catching onto this

67
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,400
concept and it's not just a concept that works when you're, well, I don't know, it works

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,080
everywhere basically and I was turned on to another podcast, which is actually, it's not

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,080
officially a podcast, it's a beer cast, now there are a lot of different beer cast, if you

70
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,440
look at the iPodot org directory, which I heard by the way that the iPodot org is listed

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,280
in the top 20,000 of most sites visited ever in the universe of the history of the

72
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,560
Incarnets, and where did I hear that, I heard it on, gosh, this is the problem, you know,

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,000
when you're listening to your I-river and open podcast that org for instance is something I

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,240
listened to a lot, I subscribe to that, but also podcast brothers and there's so many different

75
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,760
different podcasts that I just think, oh yeah, this is so great, I want to play a piece on my

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,160
show, I want to talk about it and what I want is a knob, you know, a knob where I can hit that

77
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,040
button, it remembers where it was, what file it was, let's me say something so I can, you know,

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,680
leave a little audio note to myself, that's gotta be possible, someone, somehow in the,

79
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,840
can someone hack that up in the firmware of the I-river please, I'll gladly pay for it,

80
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,000
make it happen for me. So here's one of those things that I did,

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,960
remember to put into today's podcast, this is the beer casting American tour,

82
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,320
you'll be interested to hear this because this is global maybe. Hey Adam, this is Greg from

83
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,200
beer casting.com, it's just right to let you know about the beer casting America tour,

84
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,640
which I am just about to kick off over the next few months. I don't know if you have ever heard

85
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,920
of one of our beer casts, but here's the scoop, what I do is I'm going on tour to a bunch of different

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,880
cities, all across the US, I introduce a bunch of new people who have never really met before

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,960
to what I call beer casting, podcasting with the buzz.

88
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:35,440
That's a great slogan. Podcasting with the buzz. Podcasting with the buzz, everybody.

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,680
That's what I, in fact, I wanted to call the Daily Source Code just that, the Daily Source Code,

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,280
podcasting with the buzz. Beer cast is essentially a podcast that I record live in a bar,

91
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,800
and then use all that RSS goodness to kind of get it out to the world. And I'll let people hear,

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,080
you know, what everyone's thinking about, all kinds of random shit from

93
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,240
why men are love cat fights down to politics down to tsunami, everything in between.

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,240
The tour actually just got started this week. It's going on. It was out in Worcester, Mass. On Tuesday,

95
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,360
hosted about 14 people out there. Also had a few people down in New York City doing it the same time.

96
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,480
Later on this month, I'll be hitting DC. Next Tuesday, the 18th, Seattle, Washington.

97
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,800
On the 23rd, Portland, Oregon, on the 26th, then goes on to February, and I'll be in Houston,

98
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,720
on the 7th, San Antonio, on the 8th, Austin, on the 9th. The second half of February,

99
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,480
and we'll go shoot down to Florida. Checking out West Palm Beach on the 20th, for Waterdale,

100
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,880
on the 21st, and South Beach, which you know, good and well. In the 22nd.

101
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,600
Seriously, though, the best part for me is not really the travel. The cool thing is that on

102
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,600
every city I visited or talked to or been to, it's somebody down there is helping me organize the event.

103
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,800
You know, they're getting people together to help me find location. I've been to some

104
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
most of these places, but you know, I've been there so long. So it's really great that people

105
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
come out of water work and they're saying, hey, you know, I love you to come down here to look

106
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,680
if you do it down here. March is, you know, kind of distant dream right now, but already

107
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
it looks like California is where I'm going to be. Getting people already sent it, you know,

108
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,960
and invite me to come do it down there. I'm really hoping that if there's any daily source

109
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
code listeners out there and one of these cities or someplace that they think it'd be great to do

110
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,120
one, I hope you come out, meet up, shoot me an email. Full schedule's up at www.bearcastin.com,

111
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,720
and you can check out some of the old shows and see how people are going to do it and what

112
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,360
we do and enjoy a lot of fun. You can also email me, graygetbeardcasting.com. Well,

113
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,840
well, thanks for listening and I hope you're a bandwidth get solved real soon.

114
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,560
Oh, great. Oh, please. Oh, the fucking bandwidth. It's killing me, man. It's fucking killing me.

115
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,280
I put a big post on my weblog today. Hopefully to get someone animated to come out and help me

116
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,360
before I start pulling up the curb myself to connect the last 15 meters. The last, you know,

117
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,960
30 feet or so of 50 feet maybe of wire. And when I listen to that, right, and I listen to as many

118
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,080
podcasts I possibly can. Most people, including my wife, my lovely wife Patricia, say, where do you

119
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,680
find the time to listen to all these? Well, actually, it's very clear where I find that time.

120
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,480
It's at Starbucks. Three hours a day is when I'm checking everything out. I'm not just uploading

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,760
and also downloading folks. But when I hear stuff like this, right, I'm thinking of myself, hold on.

122
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,000
We got to crank up the reverb here for a second. Ow, let's see if we can do this. Hello,

123
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,480
wait, that's the wrong. I'm doing the wrong thing here. No, I wanted to. Okay, let's see if I can, oh,

124
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,760
oh, oh, oh, oh, let's see. Okay. Hello. Okay. We are now turning the podcast transmitter towards

125
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,640
St. Louis, Missouri. Hello, and heiser Bush. Robert McColley and heiser Bush pay attention.

126
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,600
People are doing beer casts. A perfect moment to underwrite a beer cast. Okay. Let me, yeah,

127
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,680
there we go. Turn on the reverb. Just like, you know, there's opportunity out there. Anyone coming

128
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,000
into the beer space right now could own that in podcasting. And I certainly hope Greg has a good

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,600
time on this tour. I wonder what people are drinking. I'm certainly one that's going to be

130
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,040
subscribing to the show and listening to it. Okay, about the sound seeing tour, which is certainly

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
as you'll find out later on in today's podcast. It's not something that's new,

132
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,800
but it is something that we've kind of forgotten, you know, just sound. What does it sound like when

133
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,520
you're somewhere? In fact, there's a, the new Ray Charles movies coming out, right, with James

134
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,080
at Jamie Far from an living color, who was Jamie Far from Saturday Night Live. In living color,

135
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,480
I guess, right? Who does a fantastic Ray Charles? Absolutely blows me away. Can't wait to see

136
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,560
this movie, but there's a guy who, you know, from age seven, six or seven, I think,

137
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:10,160
only had sound. And we forget about that. And we forget about how much sound there is. And basically,

138
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,840
on the radio sound is all mushed and mangled into one, you know, big commercial block that kind of

139
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,920
flows towards you, not all radio, of course, but lots of, lots of radio. So people are really

140
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,320
catching on to these sound seeing tours. And I'd love to hear if other people are doing them,

141
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,880
and I'd love to, you know, go on a sound seeing tour of my own, not while recording, but while

142
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,480
listening to someone else. And I've got a lot of response to the last one, and so of course, I did the

143
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,920
my, my first sound seeing tour on South Beach, walking down the ocean drive in, in Florida.

144
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,960
The other one I did last was it Friday. In fact, I went to drop Christina off at,

145
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,800
near the high street yesterday. She was meeting up with some friends from school to go hang out, apparently.

146
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,320
It's pretty pretty harmless, I guess, for them to hang out here and gilford,

147
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,360
can't run into too much trouble. And Patricia called me and said, are you recording? You

148
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,120
should record that when you drop her off and what it's like? Good idea. I will. I certainly,

149
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,040
maybe she's just Mike Christina, and let her go on a sound seeing tour. Sound seeing tour gilford

150
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,320
has a 14-year-old girl. I'm learning so much. We've got, you know, that here in the UK,

151
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,440
so at her school, there are different groups of people. I'm not going to digress on this too much,

152
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,240
but we've got the chaves, and we've got the pikes. And I'm learning more, and more, I think I'm

153
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,240
probably more like a pikesy myself, but we're learning more about these groups every day as we settle

154
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,680
into the English culture. Anyway, so the number one thing people want to know about my

155
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,840
sound seeing tour is the setup. What am I using to record it? And I think that this is really key,

156
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,240
because first of all go through the elements, and then I'll tell you why these are probably the

157
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,320
right elements to use and why they're important. So the recording device is my iRiver,

158
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,200
IFP799. They're several different models. I like this one because it can hold up to a gig

159
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,120
of recording, and if you do, it's, I see I recorded 44 kilohertz on 128 KBPS. That's what I record at,

160
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,040
not what it actually gets sent out as, but I want to have a really high quality recording to start with.

161
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,160
And that's about a megabyte a minute. So if you do, you know, 40 minutes, you're going to be

162
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,320
pretty much around 40 meg. So plenty of plenty of space in there. What I like about the iRiver is you

163
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,440
can, when you put it into record mode, and of course you can lock it, right? So you put this little

164
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,440
iRiver into your pocket, and it won't automatically switch off. It plays the sound through. So

165
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,920
you can crank up the volume, and essentially when you have the earbuds in your ears, you're listening

166
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,800
to exactly what people will hear when they listen to the sound seeing tours. And believe me,

167
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,960
you hear a very different sound scape than when you're just listening with your ears.

168
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,960
So then what I do is I hook up my wireless microphone said. This is the kind, this is a

169
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,960
electro-eli shit. Hold on a second. Let me, let me just grab around my bag and make sure.

170
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,960
Yeah, that's a real good production.

171
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:14,240
Yeah, here it is. Sorry. I should have that. Prepared for you. This is the, okay, it's the

172
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:25,440
electro-eli CT-R-O. U-M-1-1-0. This is a set that we picked up, so there's many times before.

173
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,160
When we did a reality show to the Adam's family, and it's of course complete overkill to have

174
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,360
the transmitter in my front pocket, and the receiver in my back pocket hooked up to the

175
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:47,280
R.I. River. The advantage is this microphone is incredible. The way it picks up audio,

176
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,080
and it has a little lovelier, so you can just clip it onto your collar and no one will really

177
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,520
know that you're recording anything. The sound is phenomenal. That's what everyone hears. You can

178
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,440
hear everything around you. It has a very light compression in it. Of course, garbage and garbage

179
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,880
out. You've got to have the right microphone. This works for me. I'm sure that there are other

180
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,200
mic setups that will work, but that's what everyone wants to know. It's the electro-U-M-1-10

181
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,000
electro-U-HF transmitter receiver pair. Not cheap. I'll tell you that. I think I paid $2,000

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:32,720
euros for that, so that's almost $4,000 these days. Then what I do is I basically connect the

183
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:42,880
out of the electro receiver up to the input of the I-River, switch it on, and then I can listen

184
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,120
to exactly what I'm recording. Another additional benefit of this setup is that if you hold the

185
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
I-River in your hand, and you're left hand, for instance, and of course the wires are hooked

186
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,240
up to your head, right, and there's another wire running into your pocket to the receiver of the

187
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,960
microphone receiver, is that it looks like you're holding onto a cellular phone. Therefore, if you're

188
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,440
walking down the street, talking crap, you know, doing your sound seeing tour, people basically

189
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,680
won't look at you like you're some degenerate idiot, or the villager idiot for the

190
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,200
walking around talking to yourself. Alternatively, you can just keep the hold the cell phone up

191
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,040
to your ear, even though it can be off just pretending like you're talking into it. But I predict

192
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,800
that pretty soon it'll be normal, you know, people are doing sound seeing tours all over the

193
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,200
place, and it'll be a very normal thing to see in the city or village landscape. One additional bit

194
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:42,720
I would really love to have if it was at all possible. One additional feature would be GPS.

195
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,400
I'm so convinced that if I could connect GPS data to the sound seeing tour, that we'd have

196
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:56,160
something absolutely phenomenal. Better yet, wouldn't it be great just to have some kind of GPS

197
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,680
it is basically a connection with GPS, so I could do the sound seeing tour. I could, you know,

198
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,320
mark where I make a comment, and you could follow along with that tour, or alternatively,

199
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,440
you could just be walking anywhere, and let's say you had an iPod, an MP3 player with GPS in it,

200
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:22,880
and it would download GPS data, so let's say we had the sound seeing tour. God damn it,

201
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,680
I should register that domain name. What we're doing that, let me see if that's available.

202
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,560
Sound seeing tour.com, of course, what I would, my computer is not going to like me doing this

203
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,920
while I'm recording. Okay, before I upload the show, I'm checking God damn it, so you can't capture

204
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,920
that from me right away. I'll shoot. Now my computer is completely hoising out. Hold on, let me see if

205
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:51,040
Firefox will die. Go away. Go, please. Hide. Okay, great. So you basically upload your data. So let's

206
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,560
say I upload the data for a gilford, and if you're walking around gilford, then, you know, your MP3

207
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,200
player will go, bling, you know, we've got a message in this spot, and then I could, you know, click,

208
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,320
and then it would automatically bring me that or play that a sound file for me. Of course,

209
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,800
it seems like this would be logical to have it. Maybe we need to be able to put that into the RSS.

210
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:19,760
Yeah, there you go. So we need data that we can add into RSS feed along with the enclosure.

211
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,200
So, hey, there's another reason for a name space. Does anyone get what I'm talking about?

212
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,720
Where you can basically have these comments in space, so you could subscribe to sound

213
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,840
something like that. There's something in there that we got to work on.

214
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,440
And I've got a lot of comments and actually a real old fashioned

215
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,720
sound sing tour from the 1940s, but first a word from Patrick. Hey, Adam, this is Patrick from 80s

216
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,240
Airwaves, not a podcast, but a full-time online radio station dedicated to 80s music, movie clips,

217
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,880
and more. Now that you have your bandwidth, check us out as we broadcast live from a bonus room

218
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,560
over the garage at 80sairwaves.com. I just listened to your podcast on last week your sound trip

219
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,160
down ocean drive and south beach. I think it's the best podcast I've heard so far. You mentioned

220
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,760
two things that caused me to put this audio reply together. First, you mentioned how you're

221
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,280
involvement in the music business during the 80s caused you to miss a lot of the great stuff

222
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,000
that came out during that period. Our radio station plays a really wide variety of great music

223
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,680
from the 80s, not just the MTV stuff, but we throw in some scop, punk, rap, hair bands, more.

224
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,280
So I hope you'll check us out and let me know what you think. This could be your chance to

225
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,920
catch up on what you missed back then and Patrick got some cowbells. Second, you sounded pretty

226
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,520
stressed about the response to the interview with Madge from the East Radio person. Personally,

227
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,560
having survived cancer and radiation treatment myself and even having lost my father to cancer,

228
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,080
I personally like to tell people just to chill the fuck out. There are a lot more important

229
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,360
things in life to do than to get up tight about one person has to say about yeast infections.

230
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,200
So chill out people. That's it Adam. Keep up the great work.

231
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,880
Alright, Patrick, excellent. Thanks very much, Madge. Yeah, my mom has a sign on the her,

232
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,720
one of those old fashioned, what do you call it? My great grandmother used to knit them all the time.

233
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,320
Oh, shoot. A sampler is that we call it a sampler? And it's basically it's a crocheted or knit

234
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,280
type thing that hang on the wall and it has little slogan there like the one I remember is the road

235
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,400
to a friend's house is never long. But my mom has one and it's I used to complain about my shoes

236
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,720
hurting my feet until I met a man who had no feet. And yeah, that's obviously true. You know,

237
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm bitching and moaning about my bandwidth but the hell of a lot worse that could be happening to me

238
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,560
or you know, could have happened to have been very fucking lucky in the past year. So

239
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,920
you're right, Patrick, there you go. We also just chill out. And by the way,

240
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,080
I've been listening to Madge's recent podcasts. The one about Apple about Steve Jobs keynote is

241
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,480
fucking hilarious. You got to listen to it. Absolutely fantastic. Okay, now let's go back in time

242
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,600
because we're going to listen to well, the introduction speaks for itself. Check this out. You're going to

243
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,640
love this. Hi Adam, this is Jim Widner. I wanted to tell you that first of all how much I've been

244
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,800
enjoying your daily source code sound scene tours. Your recent tour to Starbucks reminded me of an

245
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:29,120
MP3 file that I have in my collection. It's from a radio series that the BBC and CBS radio

246
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,440
put together in 1940 called London after dark. One of the programs featured CBS radio bureau chief

247
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,760
Edward Armerall standing near Trifagar Square with the air raid sirens blaring, giving listeners a

248
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,560
sort of sound scene of the area during the blitz. So I thought you might be interested in hearing

249
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,040
a clip from the program and I've included it here. I know we take you out of the streets of Black

250
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,800
Outland and downstate Lake Crescent-Shade region streets along south to be Avenue of here to

251
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:06,320
name into sharing crossroads London's Ken Panale and so to come down this way. Moving there is Edward

252
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:19,680
Murrow, known to you as Columbia's European director. Come in Ed Murrow.

253
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,720
This is the loudest where the noise that you hear at the moment is the sound of the air raid sirens.

254
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm standing here just on the steps of St. Martin's in the field.

255
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:42,160
A search light just burst into action often in the distance. Man's single being slipping the sky above me

256
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:48,480
now. People are walking along that way. We're just at the entrance of an air raid shelter here and I must

257
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:57,120
move this kid over just to bits so people can walk in. I can see just straight away in front of me Lord

258
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:06,080
Nelson on top of that big column. There's no search light. Just square behind Nelson's statue.

259
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,440
That's like you listen to the traffic and the sound of the siren for a moment.

260
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm in California. Tell your man's steps in front of me to light a cigarette.

261
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,160
There's some kind of those red buses around the corner. Do they look at the fire?

262
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,120
Just a few lights on the top deck. In this blackness it looks very much like a ship that's passing in the knife and you just see the purple.

263
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,880
That was another bus. More search lights come into action.

264
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,520
You see them reach, they have been to the sky in the cave. Maybe they catch a cloud and seem to splash on the bottom of it.

265
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:51,200
A little traffic lights here just a small cross on the Murrow's blood are now red. The cars pull up and

266
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,160
stop. I'll just ooze down in the darkness here along these steps and see if I can pick up the sound of

267
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,320
people's feet. Do they walk along? One of the strangest sounds one can hear in London these days,

268
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,880
or rather these dark nights. Just the sound of footsteps walking along the screen.

269
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,600
Like ghosts shot with steel shoes. Attachy goes up just in front and stops.

270
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,520
Just waiting for that red light to change to green hole a siren cloud.

271
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,160
There it goes and the cars move off. More search lights are in action.

272
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,840
We've not yet seen any burst of anti-aircraft by a little bit of them.

273
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,880
No parts of this doesn't necessarily mean that there are planes actually over London at this moment.

274
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
We've had these warnings before, of course.

275
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,480
Can you hear the siren just dying away in the distance now?

276
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:52,240
Near red one walks out of this shelter. The shelter there is the crypt underneath this famous old church,

277
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,200
just on the edge of the father's square. The crypt where in days of peace one was many women,

278
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
whatever to find a night's slagginger.

279
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,520
Industrial in all the steps of people coming up and to this old church.

280
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,600
And so that went on to hang out square.

281
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,240
How cool is that? Now you may have skipped past some of it because the quality was

282
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,280
well, 1940's quality. Man, if we come a long way with sound quality. But it's not awesome

283
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,760
that then people were blown away by that apparently. Of course they were. I mean,

284
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,960
geez, you were listening to an air raid happening over London, which was thousands of miles away.

285
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,400
And I presume that was live. I'm not sure if it was. But really cool to listen to.

286
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,280
And I really appreciate the MP3 to be able to play that on the source code.

287
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,640
I was going to say, oh yeah, by the way, if you are skipping past, I've noticed on the iRiver,

288
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:02,080
which is highly configurable, actually. You can adjust the joystick as to how fast it's going to

289
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,000
fast forward when you push it to the right or of course rewind when you push it to the left.

290
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,840
And it does give you the audio as it skips the longs. You can make it go at like 30 seconds of

291
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,160
pop at one second of pop. You can really change. I think it's like four or five different levels.

292
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,960
You can change it for skipping. So another reason to look at the iRiver, I should really get paid by

293
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,680
those fuckers, shouldn't I? Or they should at least fix the firmware so I can do more cool stuff with it.

294
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,280
Anyway, cool. Sound sing tours. Definitely something that I want to hear more of. And I've been

295
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:37,520
thinking about maybe something I should do is put a new podcast together where all of these

296
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,280
clips that I play or maybe clips, maybe even clips that I don't play is probably better.

297
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,200
Just a short podcast that I like. I can just kind of throw them into one bin and you subscribe

298
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,600
to that and it just brings you all the all the new stuff that I think is worth listening to.

299
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,320
That's something we can do. Oh, here that drunken voice again. That's one thing we haven't solved.

300
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,760
Yep, it's the latency issues. I think there's a, in November, there's a podcast

301
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,320
expo. We'll be held in California that I keep hearing about. I'm not sure. I think that the

302
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,160
podcast brothers are actually organizing that. But they're talking about a place where, of course,

303
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,880
podcasts, there's a come and meet each other. But also, where vendors, and I listen to the podcast

304
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,040
brothers at podcast brothers that org all the time, where vendors will be able to show off their

305
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,520
hard and software solutions for podcasters. Well, I certainly hope we have some by them because

306
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,360
we don't really have them yet, except for mixed cast live, which, well, it works only on Windows with

307
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,320
dot net. But there's so much, so we can do so much better with tools for, for making these podcast.

308
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,680
We really can. And you know me, right? I am the guy who loves the short podcast.

309
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:58,080
The legal underground word for the day is resend, which means you aggregate a null, avoid, or cancel

310
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,440
a contract, particularly nullifying a contract by the act of a party, to declare a contract void

311
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,520
in its inception, and to put an end to it, as though it never works. Not merely to terminate it

312
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,800
and release parties from further obligations to each other, but you aggregate it from the beginning,

313
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,000
and restore parties to relative positions, which they would have occupied, and no contract

314
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,720
ever been made. Source, lacks law dictionary, with pronunciations fifth edition.

315
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,240
All right, the legal word for the day is resend. There you go. See, that would be, we could do a

316
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,880
little format where you, you know, put together an OPML file of your shit. That's almost that.

317
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,440
That's a cool application. You could decide if you wanted the word of the day, the sound of the

318
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,080
day, the grout show of the day, or the legal word of the day. I'm telling you, we got a station.

319
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,240
It's very, very close. A couple of things I wanted to mention. First of all, I want to say

320
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,600
hi to Irwin of Irwin's podcast in the Netherlands. I'm not really going to extrovert a piece of

321
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,440
his show, nor do I want to extrovert pieces of all these podcasts that I talk about, but just

322
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,320
want Irwin to know that I listen to his show. It comes out almost every single day, I think,

323
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,600
or at least like four or five times a week. I listen to his show with great joy, not only for the,

324
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,720
you know, the song that he plays every single day, which he's usually is 60s or 70s,

325
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,040
oldies, oldies, too. But also he brings me up the speed within, like, what is it? Five or six

326
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,840
minutes of exactly what's going on in the media landscape in Holland. And I don't even read the

327
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,200
paper anymore. It's Irwin's podcast. I don't know what I'm listening to. I just want to say,

328
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,240
Erwin Iglarse de Frachnallia. Also been exchanging a lot of email with the bitties,

329
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,000
the civiest bitties. You know, my girls from New York City,

330
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,640
bittiesforever.com is where you can find out all about them and their music and we've played them

331
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,360
on the source code many times. There was a cover real special last Thursday, which I didn't

332
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,160
catch until the weekend, but of course, doesn't matter because that's, you know, that's the great

333
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,800
thing about it is your iPod, it will pick it up, you know, no matter when you do your iPod scan.

334
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,760
And it was great to hear them, although God, I chat, socks, it was really quality. And I know that,

335
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,200
yeah, there were apologies at front for the quality of that, but it was an eye chat conversation

336
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,440
between Canada and I guess New York where the girls were. And yeah, it's just not cotton it.

337
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,560
You know, Skype is far superior, but of course, Skype won't work properly on the Mac yet.

338
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,840
And what an incredible opportunity. I mean, the Skype guys could make Skype the podcast tool

339
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,880
do sure, you know, instead of call someone just record it straight to MP3. I hear,

340
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,600
ah, where's that? I had a comment somewhere, which I'll probably won't be able to play today,

341
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,800
because I can't find it right off the bat, but they also have a beta test of voice mail now.

342
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,480
It'll send you an MP3 of voice mail. So even if your computer is not connected, it'll store the message for you.

343
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,160
And then I guess you can retrieve it somehow. You know, so they've got all the bits in place.

344
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:56,080
And then of course, to be able to call someone who has Skype and do an interview or have a conversation

345
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,960
or conference in multiple people, I mean, it could be your own Gilmore gang set up, you know,

346
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,520
even though, well, look at the stuff that Doug K does. He's got, you know, professional mixing board,

347
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,840
professional audio, you know, phone bridge to hook everyone together. It could be done with Skype,

348
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,520
but I don't know, Skype just isn't, you know, well, maybe they're sticking to their mission,

349
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,960
which is probably a good thing. I am, by the way, about to order one of those Skype phones

350
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,960
that you hook right up to your network. And you can use Skype directly from that phone. I think that'll be great.

351
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,720
Considering that the Netherlands is one of the, except for Afghanistan, which, you know,

352
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,240
you don't want to call Afghanistan. You might want to smoke it, but you don't want to call it.

353
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,160
The Netherlands is the most expensive country to call in the world. What a racket the KPN has going on there,

354
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,200
huh? She especially cell phones and Holland calling them from outside the country, forget about it.

355
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,680
It's more than a pound of minutes. It's almost two bucks a minute just to call a cell phone

356
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,400
from outside of the country. Anyway, so the Bitties, a great interview on coverbill, check it out

357
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:05,760
coverbill.com, and you recall that when CBS evening news came to interview me in South Beach,

358
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:15,040
that I set up a little podcast for the interviewer, Sharon, Elfonci, and I used the list of

359
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,960
these Bitties. I want to be famous, which, of course, is the, you know, I thought about it, right?

360
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,680
It's the perfect song for the type of piece that I think they're going to make. So I think that

361
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,600
that probably works out just great for them, but it also gives the Bitties another boost and guess what?

362
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,320
CBS is called. They're going to interview them, too. So I cannot be more excited. I'm telling you

363
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Grammys, onstage, Leanne, the girls, it can happen. It may not take that long.

364
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:50,160
And a quick pointer to Steve Garfield's video blog, Steve Garfield.com, if you've, I don't

365
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,840
think no Steve ever really got into podcasting. I think he's kind of, he wants to do video,

366
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,600
and he is attaching video as enclosures to his RSS feed. So you can certainly subscribe to it. I think

367
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,760
most of the iPodos will probably receive that as well, although if it gets really popular,

368
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,840
I don't know what's he's going to do for bandwidth, because it's a lot, well he's hosting it on his

369
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,560
dot Mac blog. But it's he's doing some interesting stuff. He's basically turning on the camera,

370
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,040
going places with his wife, and they're just hanging out and they're calling it a show, and you

371
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,080
should check it out. Steve Garfield test, Steve Garfield.com. And here's something cool I got in.

372
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,880
This is the kind of audio response I like. It's an interactive one where I actually have to stay

373
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,720
awake during the comment and play along. Hello Adam, Stuart Hunter here. I was really enjoying your

374
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:43,200
Miami podcast, especially the piece where I think you were in Dave's hotel room, and you were

375
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,680
challenging both Dave and Ron to recognize some music from the intro that you played from your iTunes

376
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,240
playlist. I really enjoyed that. Especially as I was putting my hand up saying, oh, I don't know.

377
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,440
I worked great. Okay. We got to do that more often then, perfect. I did think it was a little

378
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,040
bit unfair, because surely you were the music man of the 80s and 90s probably the most

379
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,320
knowledgeable. Of course, the showmaster always has all the answers, right? I mean, you know,

380
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,400
that's come on. Regis Phil did knows what the answers are in millionaire.

381
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,640
Person about the music of those times. So I thought maybe if she tried to reverse that a little bit

382
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:25,120
and challenge you on some intros. So I've picked a few little pieces together, and I'm going to play

383
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,560
them for you now. I'm not going to give you the answers right away, because if you don't get them,

384
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,840
I'm sure you will. I'm sure some of your listeners will email the answers. Okay. Oh, great.

385
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,720
This is cool. Okay. And by the way, I have not listened to the expressly. I've not listened to

386
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,440
the songs yet. So we're hearing this for the first time together. Let's see if we can do it.

387
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,080
Let's go. Let's hear it.

388
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,920
Oh, shit.

389
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,880
That from an artist who's still going strong had a big hit in the UK in the past year. Oh, shit.

390
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,040
Okay, I give. I don't know that one. That's the only clue you're going to get. Thank you.

391
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:29,200
Here's the next one. That's Robbie Williams. Isn't that the kids are all right?

392
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,200
I think that's Robbie Williams. I think I could be wrong. It was about to burst into song myself.

393
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,920
Yeah, because I thought it was coming up. That was the second one. Here's number three. Okay.

394
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
They're not named the band. Oh, these are 80s. I mean, I'm good at it.

395
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,200
A visage fade degree. Is that it?

396
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:04,240
Yeah, long, long, long, long, long. I think. Yeah, there we go. Okay, guys. I think I got that one.

397
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,160
Fizzage fade degree. Oh, we interrupt this test. Yes, dear.

398
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,440
Very quiet. Yeah. I was a layman. I was a long here and I had a bus comedy. Okay.

400
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,040
Okay, you're leaving now? Okay.

401
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,160
Is that she over there that's in my belt? What are you in here? Yeah.

402
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,600
Okay, I love you. No, close the door, please. Don't worry. I'll hear it. Yeah. I'll hear it. I'm almost done. Bye.

403
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:48,240
We have, okay, bye. Yeah, okay. Sorry. We now continue with the test.

404
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,680
Yeah, that's maybe the easiest one. Yeah, certainly had a great gun. They're of an option too. Yeah.

405
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,000
To guess what that was more. This one's a little bit harder. It's a good bit shorter because the

406
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,600
vocals kick in pretty quick. Okay. So you'll only have a few seconds here it is.

407
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,760
Lay all your hands on me. Short but sweet. Lay all your hands on me. Did not have too many hands on me.

408
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,840
Lay your hands on me. Thank you. Maybe a bit more difficult. Trying to think who they were.

409
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,200
Lay all your hands on me. It's like your hands on me. Whatever the hell we ever did it.

410
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,040
The next one will be very familiar to anyone from Australia. So this one should be fairly easy to guess.

411
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,320
John Farnam, you're the voice.

412
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:39,120
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Yeah, this is good. All right. I'm feeling a little bit better about myself.

413
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,520
Yeah, I felt really shitty. We get it.

414
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,120
Yeah, that was easy.

415
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,520
Oh, a little bit more than 10 seconds worth of that song. So hopefully I won't get into any trouble

416
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,760
from the R.I. Oh, shut up. Of course you won't. Here's song number six.

417
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:24,320
What the hell is that? I guess the common thread and the interest on playing here is that the

418
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,120
bands themselves didn't have too many hits. Yeah, or I don't know if this one was a hit.

419
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,840
Is there one? I don't know, but so.

420
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:51,840
Of course, I know the song. It's 74. 75. It's a file track for me to guess the artist and no

421
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,000
points on that one, I guess. The shot.

422
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,440
Extra points.

423
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,560
Down. It's a wonderful wonderful life by, um,

424
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,800
wonderful wonderful life by, do I get half the points that don't I?

425
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,520
For wonderful life. Maybe it's by wonderful life, um, the wet wet wet or something like that.

426
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,080
This is harder than I thought it would be, actually.

427
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,440
Well, there you go, Adam. I hope you enjoyed the challenge, though. I did.

428
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,200
To be honest, I don't think those intervals will have caused you any problems whatsoever, but

429
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,000
so it was fun to play the name that tune. I hope the listeners enjoyed it. So

430
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,360
okay. Much of good night. Excellent, man. Thank you very much. I look forward to more of those.

431
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,280
Maybe not as long. Maybe you only do top three or so, but the stumped the podcast.

432
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,880
So now there's a, there's a segment for you on the Daily Source Code.

433
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,520
Podcrumbs. Number five is out with part two of my interview with singer,

434
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,320
Sawyer, Robert Birkwan. This is the second of four parts of our conversation.

435
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:10,080
It also features the song you're hearing now, Radio Church from his 2000 CD to this day.

436
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,880
You can find the show as well as last week's first part and all the podcrumbs episodes at our new home,

437
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,320
www.podcrumbs.com. No, it also the feed address has changed and is now www.podcrumbs.com slash

438
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,480
wayindex.xml. Thanks for listening. Okay, seeing that I only have a couple of minutes left on today's

439
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,120
show. I'm not going to be able to play Robert Birkwan's song, Junkman. I'm going to move that

440
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,320
over to tomorrow's show, but of course you can check out podcrumbs number five to get all the latest.

441
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,160
It's actually a guide that's some pretty decent tunes because I did want to leave you with a

442
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,200
couple of comments that came in regarding Andy Hertzfeld's comments on podcasting,

443
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,040
which we've spoken about. And well, a lot of people responded to that. Here's the first one.

444
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,960
Hey Adam is Jack over at Boundcast. Andy Hertzfeld. Last week I set up something with a

445
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,600
Riley to have him interviewed on MacRoll that one Wednesday. I go there. We sit out and right

446
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:13,280
before the interview he says, me, I'm not much on podcasting. I'm like, well, okay. And

447
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,000
why would we go on and continue the interview and get all the way done and he's a great interview.

448
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,120
And then I put it up on the site last night and the next thing I know I'm on the train coming home

449
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,120
and here's your show and you're like Andy Hertzfeld, interview. I'm like, oh, great!

450
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,720
This is fantastic. And no, it's the scene at an interview about how he does like podcasting.

451
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,960
I'm just blown away by that. So what can I say? And life's full of this quirky kind of ironic

452
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,760
timing. Hi Adam. This is Reed. I just wanted to say about Andy Hertzfeld and what he said about

453
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,160
I have a podcasting. Like I said, my blog, he's just doesn't get it. He's a kind of person who would have

454
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,000
said back in the early 90s that the web was completely unnecessary because HTTP is just a duplication

455
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,480
of existing things like FTP. What do we need to do HTTP for? Yeah, so don't worry about him.

456
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,840
Okay, he just got his head up his ass. Oh, don't say that. Okay, so that's pretty much the range of the

457
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:19,920
comments and how they went from left to right and many more in between. But then, I guess it's the

458
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,320
what is it? The Wizards of Technology? Do they, Mr. Mark and Digital Bill, I think that's who they

459
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,760
are. They, they caught Phil Schiller, who is, what is he vice president of Apple? He's the

460
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,800
number two guy. I think they caught him outside McRoll Expo and they got his comments on podcasting.

461
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:52,960
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. That was funny. Mark has got so nervous. They started falling

462
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,520
all over himself. Let's listen to that one more time. I don't mean to laugh, but I'm noticing that

463
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,280
now for the first time. It's all right. I sound drunk on my shows. Here, let's try that again.

464
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,960
And listen to him fucking blowing. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I got to go. I've got much, much more

465
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,520
to do over here. You know, I got no time to talk to you a little, this is it, guys. You know,

466
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,440
if you want to, if you want to get these guys, you want to have them look at you

467
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,000
serious, you got to trick them. And you need to have a microphone that has a mic cue on it.

468
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,560
You know, it needs a mic cue, so you look official. And it could say anything on there. As long

469
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,000
as it's a cue that fits up that mic, baby, that's one thing to say, oh, wait a minute, that's

470
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,920
some, and maybe a big windscreen, you know, with your logo on it as well. That is guaranteed

471
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,680
to not get that response. Oh, I'm sorry. I've got to run, guys. I've got to get run. I'm full

472
00:43:41,680 --> 00:44:02,640
of shit. I'm hurt. I broke it. I'm right. I'm believable. He talks just like he does when

473
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,720
he's doing those keynotes when he's on stage. I think it's really cool technology. I think

474
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm really happy a lot of people are trying out. This is really wonderful. Where's your

475
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,680
mic cue? I can't see your windscreen. Are you really an official broadcaster? He sounds like

476
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:31,680
a freaking robot. A fun way to get more programming on your iPod. Interesting. Interesting.

477
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,760
A fun way to get more programming, more programming on your iPod. That's a lot in there, I

478
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:53,760
feel. Oh, yes.

479
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:11,280
That's it for the source code for today, January 17th. As always, you can leave us a comment

480
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:18,640
at umadcurry.com or on the weblogcurry.com. Okay, tomorrow. What's we do tomorrow?

481
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,600
They can talk a little about South Beach. Some of the things that we discussed, of course,

482
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,920
you couldn't imagine most of the things we're thinking about are they commercial nature.

483
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,560
And I'm also going to think about working on that podcast feed of all the different clips I've

484
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,720
done. I quite sure I want to put that together. Oh, and of course, before I upload this show,

485
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,920
I'm totally going to see you sound seeing.com today. So by the time you hear this show,

486
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,640
you'll be registered to me. I hope. All right, everybody. Thank you very much for sending in your

487
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,400
comments. Keep it coming. And tomorrow, I'm another dating source code. Who knows? Maybe with some

488
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:04,400
broadband if those BT engineers can find it in their hearts to connect the last 15 meters from

489
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:17,200
the curb to the house. Take care, everybody. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, bye.
