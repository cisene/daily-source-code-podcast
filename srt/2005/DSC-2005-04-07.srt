00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Daily source code for April 7th, 2005.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
A top of the hour, I'm gonna go home, and then it's Adam Curry.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're DJ, has only just begun.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped in my ass.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Today's Thursday the 7th.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh my goodness, okay, a brand new form of Daily Source Code.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So today we've done this once before.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We've done it in Miami.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm testing out some data software.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let me just call it the Cas Blaster for now.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is going to be the easy-to-record podcast software.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, oh my goodness.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's been a while since I've been messing around with all the faders and all that stuff and all the software.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've been working with a developer for the past couple of weeks on creating a piece of software that runs on a window.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a computer which will enable anyone to basically get a podcast recorded very, very simply.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And of course, there's lots of programs out there that record your microphone and there's lots of programs that can mix.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But to really make it easy, I guess that's all interface stuff, right?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So I figured today would be the day that I tried the second test of this series.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The second test of this, of using the Windows tablet.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm actually using the pen now to control the software, although it works perfectly well with the mouse.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But what the hair, right?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The sound, of course, will not be what you're used to hearing from the source code because I'm not running this through my sure SM7.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Not running it through any processing, no compressors, any of that.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is purely a laptop and a headset.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And the headset is actually let me just see.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's an all-tech lancing.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And it doesn't have the best of all sound quality because of course it's all about the sound card and the preamp and all that stuff.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But it does the job okay.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And the software is set up in a way that is just absolutely phenomenal.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's really what I, as a radio guy, want to have because it has, and of course I'm providing a, like a semi screenshot along with the show notes.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You can take a look at this.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It has a row of what I'd call cart decks, which are basically jingles.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can see it's one, two, three for so it's 10 slots for jingles.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And then it has four slots for songs.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Again, this is all beta software, so it could be crapping out, it could sound, it could basically sound shitty.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It has meters on it, so you can keep the levels kind of in check.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Basically, you want the two view meters to be in the yellow and they can hit the red.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:31,000
In fact, on this meter, I'm seeing now you can hit the red almost all the way because when you, when you spike the meters to the right, then you're basically at zero db, which would be the maximum, it shouldn't be any more than that.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Also, no reverb or any effects like that, which apparently seems to be very tough to do in windows, at least while you're recording something on the fly.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But, you know, the whole setup is, it's, I gotta say, it's sweet, got three faders here, one for the headphones, which,

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh man, okay, so I don't know how to integrate Skype yet, so I'm not gonna, oh, I actually should have answered that call, that was pretty stupid.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I bet you'll work too, what maybe it won't.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So that's something I gotta check out, that's for another beta test.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It has a mic fader, which you basically set once, so that you're not modulating in the red, then it has a little talk button, which you turn off, I just did that there.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And then it has an auto button, well, it actually has another fader for a player, which means anything you play from either the cart decks or from the song decks.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you aren't comfortable with fading stuff up and down, so for instance, let me just give an example with the rock money-off opener there.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So now I'm basically sliding that fader down and then I slide it back up like that.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right, so I'm doing that manually, it has an automatic feature, so if I hit that, it'll just bring down the level of whatever's playing to basically match your voice or your voice can talk over that.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And when you release it, it should automatically flow back up.

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay, first bug determined, it doesn't fade back automatically.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let me try that again, so I've got it up about the same, just grab the fader there.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This particular instance, the pen is not doing a good job, let me just grab the mouse, okay.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So now it's at equal level with a microphone and I hit the auto button and it just fades it down nice and smoothly so you can talk over it.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So that works well, only when I release that, it should go back to the same spot, and it's not doing that, okay, so that's something we got to work on.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, so I can just stop that, that's pretty cool because everything immediately queues up, so it can be restarted, so you don't have to rewind any players or anything.

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So I have a couple other jingles that I just and sweepers that I just loaded in here.

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is one that was sent to me the other day.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hi, this is Rachel from audiocollective.net.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you're listening to Adam Curry on the daily source code.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The only thing this beta software doesn't do is light my spliff, that's too bad.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It has a pause button, but I'm afraid to use it because I don't think that's implemented yet.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, now to the player, the player windows, let me see, I just put a couple of things in here, just to give you some examples.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let me kick this one in for you.

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think this is actually a mashup I might have played before, but we'll just roll this one out for you right now.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We roll rock and roll you on the on the on the on the on the on the daily source code.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We roll rock and roll you on the on the on the daily source code.

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We roll rock and roll you on the on the daily source code.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We roll rock and roll you on the daily source code.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We roll rock and roll you on the daily source code.

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We roll rock and roll you on the daily source code.

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you want to hear.

75
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I want to hear audience hear you hear me out.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And we'll be moving on and singing at some old song

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And we'll be singing

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We'll be singing

79
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We'll be singing

80
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We'll be singing

81
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We'll be singing

82
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We'll be singing

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We'll be singing

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We'll be singing

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We'll be singing

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We'll be singing

87
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We'll be singing

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We'll be singing

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We'll be singing

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We'll be singing

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We'll be singing

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You need to keep stop

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You need to keep stop

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We will be singing

95
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We'll be singing

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We're singing

97
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We're singing

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We're singing

99
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We're singing

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We're singing

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We're singing

102
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Hey, that's interesting

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
All right, learn something new here

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
By the way, you're just along for the ride beta testing with me, I guess

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So under each of the song players

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It has a little progress bar that shows you how far it's playing

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now I don't know if that MP3

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Just had more like

110
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Silence at the end of it

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But let's see

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because I basically it didn't look like it was all the way at the end

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So let me drag the

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The progress bar to kind of

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Where it's stopped there

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh my second now, I'm just going on my pen

117
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's not wanting to react very well

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So if I play it from here

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well that's another thing that has to be fixed

121
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So you can't actually pause it

122
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You can't actually queue it up to a spot where you want it to be

123
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay, we've got to improve that

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I hope you're understanding

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All the crap that I'm talking about here

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Because basically the whole point of this is to

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is to have an application that

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
95% of the world can use

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Which means it has to run on windows

130
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And that is all encompassing

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You put your jingles

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Or your little bit you want to play

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Stuff that you need to see the progress bar on to see how far it is

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Of course why that didn't work out in that case

135
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm not quite sure

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You should be able to queue it up

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
When started from that spot that didn't work

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So that's something we got to change

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So actually I hope someone's writing this down

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So we can make these improvements

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What's really nice is there's

142
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
In the in the recorder portion of the of the interface

143
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The record button shows you exactly how long

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Been recording so that's 11 minutes right now

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, so that's kind of screw up the idea I had

146
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Because I have a piece of the

147
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Lissivia's Bitties the latest bitty cast that was from

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Or was that yesterday's bitty cast the six

149
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And they played a song

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Just at the end of the show, which was written by

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Bitty Amanda Monaco I believe

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So now I'm going to have to fast forward to it

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So let me see

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So I can definitely drag

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's the girls

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So let me drag the player over

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That works fine actually

158
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay, let me

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Back to her house and she was so cute

160
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So I'll go in the back to see

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay, we're just a little bit more

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I will be better soon

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
For girls

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay, okay, here it is, let me just

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay, so that's something we got to fix

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Got to be able to cue stuff up in the middle of a song

168
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm gonna play a song in Amanda wrote when she first met Andre

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay, listen to this song. It's a beautiful song

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Thank you

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a sweetest thing ever

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I've been wine, I've been dying

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
For so many a time

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Left to wait for a date

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And wait

176
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And wait

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Could be tall handsome stable

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Or cultured yet torture

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And yet they are one

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And the same

181
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Tall or shard

182
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, I don't care if he's got money

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Lately they're one and the same

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This one, that one

185
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
All a disappointment they should hang

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Their heads down in shame

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll hear him say

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There is no one like you

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The crises and old flames arrive

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And make me blue but someday soon

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll find myself a brighter flame

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That won't be just one and the same

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll hear him say

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There is no one like you

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No crisis, no all games

196
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I know my lonely days all through

197
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll have found myself a brighter flame

198
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That isn't just one and the same

199
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He won't be just one and the same

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh man, the biddies, they sing so beautiful

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't you agree

202
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Just give me goosebumps

203
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay, so that won't work perfectly

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It ended the player progress bar

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Showed the very ending

206
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So I guess the wheel rocky thing was just a bogus MP3

207
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's amazing

208
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Because I've been working with this developer as I said for a couple of weeks

209
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And you think you've got everything right

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And then you go and test it and it's all the stuff pops up

211
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh man, no I need that

212
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I guess it only really works when you're podcasting

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm really trying to figure this stuff out

214
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So let me just fire off another jingle there

215
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thanks to Tom Schooting

216
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He's the guy that puts on my old radio shows online

217
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The Korean vendingles shows that I used to do it radio Veronica

218
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He does that from Australia

219
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I sent him that whole box of cassettes when we moved

220
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And he's just been putting stuff up online

221
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Relentlessly, it's been great

222
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He sent me all these jingles that I guess he found in some

223
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
On some cassettes somewhere

224
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We talked a while ago about Big Bad Al

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I think I was weeks ago

226
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Kind of like the daddy over the radio

227
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The guy who mentored me and a lot of other guys

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's what I actually played at the very beginning of the show

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Let's listen to him again there

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
A top of the hour I'm gonna go home

231
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And then it's Adam Curry

232
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I use that one so often

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Of course now it sounds kind of shitty because it's coming off of a cassette

234
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
16 minutes 23 seconds into this

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is so far going pretty well

236
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What's nice about the program as I said it's supposed to be all encompassing

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
When you stop recording, it'll obviously stop recording

238
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Then you hit save and then it pops up a window that asks you for some basic information

239
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What does that information?

240
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, of course, it's the ID3 tags, right?

241
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And then you save it and it's done

242
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's already recorded MP3

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's compressed with a standard setting

244
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We're using the same setting I always use on the daily source code

245
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Which after months of fooling around with bit rates and sample rates

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We kind of figured this is the one that works the best

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So we simplified all that

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
These of course I guess could eventually all be advanced options

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If you really want to set that

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But after that

251
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There will of course be an upload piece

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And I've been thinking about all these tools that are coming online

253
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And I mean it's like there are so many different recorder packages out there

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There's a big benefit to having an interface like the one that I'm using right now

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Because it's really set for podcast

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And at least for a particular type of podcast

257
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There's more I'd love to have Skype integrated into this

258
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So if you want to just call someone on Skype it just records that

259
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Or maybe you could even set a level on that

260
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Something we got to think about as well

261
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But then the upload to the server where you're hosting it

262
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I think that should just be using the meta weblog API

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Which I believe does in closures

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Not 100% sure but I think it does

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Because then basically it'll create a blog post

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And you could use that with any weblogging software

267
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You could use it with any podcast hosting service

268
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And even though I definitely want to

269
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Rule the world global world domination

270
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Anything we can do with podcasting

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It seems like that's the smartest way to go

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Because there's going to be lots of different programs

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
To record and to upload

274
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And it just takes away all the hassle of trying to figure out

275
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How do I get it up there?

276
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
How do I FTP then create the RSS feed?

277
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think it's some programs that I've seen out there

278
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Create an RSS feed for you

279
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then it'll upload that as well

280
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But I think that it seems if we just follow the path

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The blogging software has gone

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There's lots of different applications

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That are basically just using the meta weblog API

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
To talk to in this case I use a

285
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Manila server for my weblog

286
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And I've used radio user land

287
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Through the meta weblog API

288
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And currently I use Mars Edit

289
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Which is made by

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I think Brent does that

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Or does net news wire of course I do that on the Mac

292
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And then it makes a lot of sense

293
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Because then instead of trying to compete on all these weird levels

294
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You just compete on the interface

295
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Whatever interface works best for you

296
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And you could switch back and forth between

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Different programs

298
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Perhaps depending on what type of podcast you're doing

299
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So it's kind of a bummer that as I said

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I can't queue up some of these songs

301
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Believe me by the next beta

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm sure I will be able to

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I found this show which is

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It might be an existing radio program

305
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But probably only on AM

306
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But it's a financial podcast

307
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The following is a presentation of the Tiger Financial News Network

308
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I guess

309
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I guess it is from a network

310
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The Tom O'Brien show

311
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He'll just scan forward

312
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What you hear?

313
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
He'll show

314
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Pieces of eight

315
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What you talk about is principles

316
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And whether you agree

317
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's using the auto ducking feature there

318
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Automatically lowering that anyway

319
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay, so that's the Tom O'Brien show

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Podcasts I'm now subscribed to

321
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It does sound like it's coming from a

322
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
From a regular radio program

323
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Okay

324
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, I guess we've pretty much done everything we can

325
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
For this particular test

326
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There's one very important thing

327
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I still have to wait

328
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hold on a second before I get to that

329
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Let me just unplug the power cord

330
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let me go mobile here for a sec

331
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
We walk over to the Mac

332
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Where I have my other show notes

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Usually

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let me just check and make sure I'm not missing anything

335
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Using the headset is kind of cool though

336
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I hope it sounds reasonably okay

337
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
No, the only thing I had in there

338
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Was the Bitties thing

339
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay, so we've pretty much

340
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Everything I want to do for this beta test

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
A little bit shorter source code

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The normal but

343
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I hit all the things I wanted to hit

344
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Except for

345
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The fact that I would like to wish

346
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
My beautiful wife

347
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
My bride of almost 18 years

348
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The happiest birthday

349
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You could ever imagine

350
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Because it's her birthday today

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Happy birthday baby

352
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I love you

353
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Alrighty

354
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So

355
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Thank you very much for

356
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Bearing with me on this test

357
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
As I said, I'll be providing

358
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
At least a partial screenshot

359
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Of the software in the show notes

360
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So you can see

361
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Kind of get a visual representation

362
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Of what I was talking about

363
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We walked through the interface

364
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And you'll be able to comment on that

365
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Email at amercurry.com

366
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Or of course on the weblog www.curry.com

367
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The latest show

368
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The podcast feed and the archives

369
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
All on dailysourcecode.com

370
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Tomorrow I'll be back

371
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And we'll see if we can improve on this

372
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Or maybe even get some effects going

373
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't know

374
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's kind of a work and progress

375
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I'm really enjoying it

376
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
A better way to bait a test podcast

377
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Offer with on a podcast

378
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Take care everybody

379
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll see you tomorrow

380
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Bye bye
