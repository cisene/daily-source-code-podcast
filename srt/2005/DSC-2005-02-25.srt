00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Daily Source Code for February 25th, 2000 films.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Transmeters?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We don't need no stinking transmutes?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Autistic!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a food curry!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey everybody, thank God, it's Friday!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Last time to come to you from San Francisco, California,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
it's the Friday edition of the Daily Source Code.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It is February 25th, 2005.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How you doing everybody?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's been a long day, been traveling, been up to the northern part of the United States.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
North West, that is.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The power of the New York Institute.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I made the big trip up to Microsoft today to see my buddy ate a curse.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now we eat the Dutch pronunciation.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I actually tried that.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It wasn't we arrived at building number.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wasn't I wrong?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't know what building to go to.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Man, that place is too much.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
As for to eat a curse.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And of course I have a fault that I had to use the American pronunciation.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Eric Huggers.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Anyway, it's another source code.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
With some toxic music, the hit test.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And of course, some mash.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The power of the New York Institute.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I gotta tell you, I really love you guys.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You guys listening right now.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You listening on your iPod.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You sitting in your computer.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Checking it out.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
iTunes.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What else is there?

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Win-am.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Microsoft Media Player.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I really appreciate it.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But I'm so fried.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I almost contemplated that's where you should go.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But that's true.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And we've got so much real time difference.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's already 630 in the UK.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's kind of cool.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thinking about that, Patricia and Christina are about to go in one minute from now.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And they'll be waking up and I'm about to go to bed.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's actually been pretty tough.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
All the time difference isn't everything.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And talking to the girls.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I miss them.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Can you tell?

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I really do.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You know, going through airports today.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Seeing parents with kids and teenage daughters.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm like, oh man.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I miss home.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's time to go home.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's really been a great trip.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I want to tell you all about or most about what happened today.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Because I learned a couple of new important words that we'll talk about.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As I said, got young polettes hit test on the way.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's usual in the show.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Also a pod save tune lined up.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And lots of cool stuff to talk about.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But first, don't you think it's time for another...

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Microsoft.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Member Baruch Assault.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Member Yazoo.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Check it out.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's go.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000

Let's go.

Let's go.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's go.

92

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's go.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's go.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's go.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's go.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go.

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go.

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go.

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's go.

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's go.

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's go.

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's go.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's go.

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's go.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's go.

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's go.

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's go.

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's go.

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go.

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's go.

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's go.

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's go.

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go.

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's go.

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's go.

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's go.

128
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go.

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go.

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go.

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

132
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
February 2005, Ruka Salt, man, that brings about memories. It must have been 1990. Oh, man. I'm gonna take a guess. Five.

133
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
My first company on ramp. We had come off doing...

134
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We did a promotion for, actually, we did a cybercast of the Grammys. The Grammy Awards. Oh, that's a story all by itself.

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But like half a year, no longer than that. About nine months later, I'm just kind of going by memory here, not by anything I've written down.

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We did a promotion for Molson Ice. It was, it was actually a great promotion.

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You could win a trip to the North Pole for the Molson Ice Polar Beach Party. And we actually did a cybercast, which was audio. And we also at the time did CUCME.

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Remember that, CUCME? From the North Pole, from Tuk-Tyuk-Tuk, in Northwest Territories, that was a several miles inside the, the Pole Circle.

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And it was Metallica. It was Varucas Salt and Courtney Love with Hole at the time. And it was a real concert that was put on for like, you know, a couple hundred prize winners.

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And one of the prize winners, or a couple of the prize winners came through the internet promotion at the time through Molson Ice.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And we did some cool shit back then. We had this road box that we created, this big flight case, which had, I think, 30 modems in it. At the time, what was it, maybe it was a 9600 modems, probably 9600.

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Maybe I can't really remember. I think it was 9600, maybe they were faster at the time. But we had this, this great guy at the time he worked for Digex, who, with the guys who helped me set up MTV.com back in the day.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Robert C. Strum RS, and he had constructed this multiplexer system. So basically, as long as you could get, you know, 20 or 30 or 40 phone lines, we could combine those and create one big fat pipe.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,000
On the other end, of course, at Digex, we had a demultiplexer, or whatever, so that you could essentially create, oh, we had, you know, pipe of like, you know, 350 kilobits per second or something like that. It was very cool.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The road box, I'll never forget. It's somewhere that, that thing's got to be around somewhere. Someone has that. I'm sure I've no fucking clue what happened to it, but it was a beautiful piece of work.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So anyway, so that was my, my memory there of Rooka Salt. Thanks to Sid, the Pimp Daddy from the Netherlands, for sending me always supplying me with a fresh supply of mashups. And I got to say, being out here on the West Coast, also on the East Coast, but more on the West Coast,

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:54,000
more people have come up to me and said, man, what do you get those mashups? You know, I love them. And I always say, again, from Sid, but I think also mix freaks.org is a place you might want to sniff around or email some of the guys there. They seem to be doing a lot of interesting work with mashups. And yeah, do love it. It's totally cool, specifically because, you know, it's stuff that will never ever be able to release, to be released commercially just because of the clearances and we've gone through that.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
All the time here on the show.

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Some, and I just got back, what time is it now? It's 10.35. We'd left this morning, man.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Got up at five o'clock to leave at quarter six to catch the seven A.M. flight up to Seattle to then grab a cab up to, up to Redmond.

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So, you know, and just got back on the whatever the flight gets in at like 8.15, 8.30. And so just back in the hotel scanning through email.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And several comments on my pronunciation issue yesterday of aluminium, pretty much everyone who was emailed me agrees that that is indeed the correct pronunciation.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In fact, some English listeners said, wow, you know, it's like, you're the first yank I've ever heard pronounced it correctly because most Americans say aluminum.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But I did make a mistake, apparently Scott emailed me and said, you know, although aluminium is the correct pronunciation.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's not an alloy, as I said, he goes on to say, first of all, an alloy is a compound of two or more metals.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Aluminium is a pure element, not an alloy. The metal was named by English chemists, Sir Humphrey Davy.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Who derived the name from the mineral called aluminum.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Sir Humphrey first spelled it.

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Now I want to get it right now.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Aluminium in 1807, then change it to aluminum. There you go, in 1807, and finally settled on aluminium in 1812.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:46,000
English chemists like the latter because it sounds like many other elements whose name and in in like magnesium, potassium, sodium, and whatever ends you can come up with.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Actually, you should check this out. There's more to this history with several great links in the show notes for today's show.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I actually wound up here in this email saying, just started to help out in case some limey brick is trying to make you think that you're perfectly acceptable American pronunciation is inferior.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Next time someone says, it's really aluminium feels, what is this? Ask for it.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I should be reading emails. Should just let you read them okay. Anyway, aluminium, it's our friend, isn't it?

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So, this morning we, of course, had a wonderful experience. Do you have any idea what that experience could be?

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Well, it's my hot topic, isn't it? Is that goddamn airport security camera?

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There's all these grown-up business people taking off their fucking clothes, taking off.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know, at this case, I guess I'm a business person as well. You know, taking off my bell, taking off my shoes, walking on socks, taking off my coat, taking my laptop out of the bag, put it in a separate tray. Why do we put up with this crap, man?

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Email from Sketer Murphy also listed in the show notes for today's podcast.

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There's a book called Beyond Fear by Bruce Schneier and he's a security guy and actually agrees that most of what gets implemented in the name of security is pretty bogus.

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And there's a link to the book and there's some pretty interesting concepts about the concept of feeling secure.

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I'm all for deterring people of doing nasty shit without a doubt. I just don't think this is very effective.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I think it's actually, I'm starting to think it's bad for business, bad for the economy.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And, you know, it's just, it's a major pain in the ass. It's degrading. I feel, you know, dehumanized. Again, not against airport security.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't want terrorists to do anything, not trying to be un-American. But, you know, I actually, I've made a habit now of studying the security personnel who, I think in, in most cases, are pretty much from private firms who receive government contracts.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And these are the same people that I used to laugh about.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I play that George Carlin bit about airport security. I should look that one up again and play that again for you.

179
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The same people that in the, in the late 80s and 90s were doing airport security. One big freaking joke. They're not catching everything. Certainly not.

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You know, if you're really going to make it tight, make it tight. Don't put the burden on me to take off my shoes. That's horseshit. Really do a good job.

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You know, I saw people, you know, particularly pay attention to the, to the screeners, people who were watching the monitors.

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I paid attention to the one lady who was sitting behind the monitor. And she was looking around, you know, and then stuff is going by.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I saw at least in the five minutes I was watching her three bags passed by the screen when she did not look at the screen. They just went by. And by the way, my bag is, you know, it's full of wires.

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's full of devices. It's full of cylindrical objects. Like I've got my, my eye chat. What is it? I cite camera. I've got transmitters. We don't need no stinking transmitters.

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, I got my wireless transmitters. I got enough shit in there. And I also had my, of course, had my hairspray in there, which I think is illegal to take on the plane.

186
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But no one fucking looks at that. No one opens it up. There's no questions. You know, I think my bag is highly suspect. I'm always ready to have to crack it open and go. I always, I love her.

187
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I a lot ten minutes extra time when I go through airport security, because I think in my bag is pretty much always going to get pulled out.

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Anyway, did not happen. So went up to Seattle to go visit my friend, Eric at Microsoft. And he had actually planned for us to meet with a couple other people in the company. He works for the

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Winno's media player division. He was just recently brought up. Now he's Dutch guy. I've known him from Holland. He was in Rome.

190
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Not quite sure what he was running for Microsoft in Rome, but he got bummed away up to, you know, he's a big muckity muck now, which is cool. You know, like, yeah, go, Eric.

191
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And so he had he lined up, you know, a little little tour and people meet with and talk with and exchange ideas.

192
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And what happened right off the bat, which was so incredibly sweet as we walked in.

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What is it? So building, I think, which building it is. There's a lot of buildings there. I would last time we were there was 10 years ago.

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you believe it, 10 years ago. But that was just as Microsoft was trying to figure out what to do with their browser.

195
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And the Netscape browser was out there and Ron and I were actually doing some consulting for them back then.

196
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And I remember very distinctly, I think, vowing never to go back to that place because we sat in a windowless conference room for three days.

197
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And we actually took turn sleeping and pretending like we were awake. It was just horrendous.

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And it was really like, everyone had to stick up their ass and it was, you know, buttoned down shirts and it was, yeah, it was just the culture was not my culture at all.

199
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You know, smart company, of course. But this was 10 years ago. And that's really changed.

200
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It felt much, maybe, you know, the walls, of course, that these buildings are also 10 years older. So it looks a little bit more crudty, a little more lived in, you know, there's some spots on the carpet.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But the people seem, yeah, just, you know, they seem much more with it than then. I don't know what it is, but the culture has definitely been more thing in changing.

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
All for the, for the better.

203
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Very open culture as well. You know, people talk freely about what they're thinking and what they're working on. It's not this really not the hush hush that that it used to be or, you know,

204
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I remember you had to register your bag at the door and, and, you know, they check your machines and you just, you know, you could even crack a laptop without, you know, people bouncing on you was, it was kind of back in those days, right.

205
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:10,000
A lot of people who are listening to the daily source code, up in Redmond, which it continues to astound me. Actually, when I call Patricia, I said, you know, I keep forgetting that, you know, this thing is not just, you know, like my, my buddies checking it out.

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:21,000
There's lots of people listening to these podcasts. And, um, they had heard that I had forgotten my eye river or lost my eye river or misplaced it for sure. And there was so kind.

207
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Um, I guess the, well, Microsoft has a deal with the creative labs for the, actually, let me go grab a hold of it one sec.

208
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Uh, for the creative labs and P3 players. Oh, this is the Zen micro. It's the new one you may have seen advertised around.

209
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Uh, and they had one for me and they said, well, you know, uh, we feel so bad that you misplaced your, uh, your non-ipod MP3 player that we want to hook you up with one.

210
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And big caveat, this is so typical for technical for, uh, technical technology geeks.

211
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Like, but don't really use it until we send you the new firmware because you got to install that because the old one sucks and you'll hate it and we don't want you to hate it.

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Uh, so that was, that was incredibly nice of them to do. And, uh, so I haven't played with it. I, you know, I'll load the new firmware first before I do that.

213
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Um, that's the kind of interesting. It's, uh, yeah, it's a, it's a cool little device, actually. So I'll give you a full review of it once I've played with it. I'll charge it up and I'll, um,

214
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and I'll see if I can get it to sync up with, uh, with one of the iPod or clients to get it rolling. Um, what is extremely cool about this that I have immediately, uh, gravitated towards is it has a wonderful pair of headsets.

215
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And, you know, don't forget that, uh, the headphones really is a, of course it's the final, you know, it's the final piece in the chain before the sound hits your ears.

216
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And, uh, these, I'm, I'm, I'm using them right now. Clearly, um, they're great. Um, somehow they have a higher output. I actually had to turn down the volume for the first time on the output of my, uh,

217
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
my Mac while I was recording because if I turn it up, it's actually so loud that it'll start to, um, produce feedback here.

218
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hold on. So this, so if I turn it all the way up, you can hear the whoops there. Go. So it's feedback directly from the mic to these headphones.

219
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's just, that's pretty incredible stuff. So they're really loud, which is good because as a, as an old radio geek, you know, you want to hear yourself nice and loud.

220
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Uh, that's what radio geeks usually want. Um, and, uh, they're good. They're also white, by the way, which is kind of funny.

221
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So it's, uh, it did that. That's some iPod-nish stuff going on there, but I like them. Also, that's one thing I've noticed with headphones.

222
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And I don't know why this is the, so this is the design that I like, which is, um, one wire that splits into two wires of equal length.

223
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And I have had so many different headphones. You know, earbuds headphones were talking about, right? So the little ones that go in your,

224
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
you're not in your ears, not something goes over the top of your head. Um, where one side of the wire is really short.

225
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And the other ones really long. And I've never quite understood what the, what the design, what the point of that design is.

226
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You know, I want it, I want it symmetrical. I want it, you know, right down the middle. And, and this one is just like the iPod headphones.

227
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is a great, and I, like Sony does that. Why do they have one side short in the other side long? You know, I never quite got that.

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If you have any ideas why, you know, it's clear to you an industrial design choice that they made, but can't quite figure it out.

229
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So let me know if you, if you have any ideas. Um, so, um, first of all, um,

230
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:37,000
a lot of response to my comments about San Francisco yesterday. Hey, not everybody is clueless, okay? It was just kind of like pointing out some stuff.

231
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I've learned something really interesting out here and up at, uh, at Microsoft as well.

232
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm completely contrary to the East Coast where, uh, I'm not quite sure what it is or why it is.

233
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But on East Coast, you walk in and people like, what's your idea? This is my idea, you know, boom.

234
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What, you know, what are you guys doing? What are you working on? And everyone's just, you know, immediately sharing information and talking a million miles a minute.

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And, um, that's kind of like a New York way of doing stuff.

236
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:18,000
On the West Coast in San Francisco and, uh, and also up north, there's one thing that is just rampant.

237
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's the concept of an NDA, an NDA, and, uh, I think what the NDA actually stands for is no damage announcements.

238
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Because, you know, you all signed this piece of paper that says, well, we don't talk about anywhere what we talked about today.

239
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I think what they're saying is, you know, no damage announcements. Just don't make no goddamn announcements. It's like the YNDA, no damage announcements.

240
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So that's what everyone's about on the West Coast, no damage announcements. We're not going to say anything.

241
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And there's a lot of heat about podcasting up at Microsoft. I mean, I can tell you that much.

242
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Um, some really smart people have really been thinking about this from, um, all different directions, all angles.

243
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And it was just, it was really nice to see the effort and the amount of thought that went into, um, you know, some of the stuff that they shared with us.

244
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And it was just, it was a really nice day. And they fed us nicely. The heat is really cranking up, uh, particularly out here on the West Coast.

245
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And now, um, people who aren't NDA, who aren't under the no-dam announcements coming out with some announcements. You know, there's so much heat that anyone scrambling to say, oh, we got something going on. You know, come over here. Look quick.

246
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Um, particularly some, uh, some podcasts, uh, I guess hosting and creation services that are popping up.

247
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Remember, um, Evan Williams guy is the kid who started blogger and sold it to Google and, uh, and left like pretty quick after he sold it to Google.

248
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He's not cropped up with, uh, with an offering. Oh, it's not quite an offering. He's, he's made a damn enough.

249
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's, uh, an audio, uh, audio.com. Um, so, um, that and there's another one.

250
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What I saw some other, um, hosting, uh, creation. Oh, God. I should look that up. It's like it was a weird URL.

251
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Lin, hold on. Let me try, let me see if I can find this for you on Firefox. Hold on a second. Let me, hopefully it'll open up without going nuts. Okay. That worked.

252
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Um, what was it? Oh, wow. Oh, here it is. Oh, I love it when you just type in the L in a meeting.

253
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Libsyn, Libsyn.com. That's another diamond announcement that came out. L, I, B, S, Y, N, or in

254
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Curry Speak, Lima, India, Bravo, Sierra, or Yankee, November. It's the liberated syndication podcasting made easy.

255
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Um, leave your storage and bandwidth concerns to us. And, uh, that looks pretty good. It may not be for someone who has a tremendous amount of traffic that you're pushing,

256
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
but the price is certainly seem to be right if you're looking for a place to host your podcast and do that cost effectively.

257
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Um, and I'm actually seeing several of these being created. So, uh, damn announcements all the time. And, uh, you know,

258
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
one of these days, I'll see if I can make a damn announcement. Wouldn't that be kind of fun?

259
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Um, let me just see why I just have Firefox up. I'm just looking at, uh, let me see.

260
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What's this, uh, oh, a second. Oh, what's this? Oh, there's actually a story about Odio. Here we go. Let me see.

261
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And the time's cool. As your dam announcement. There's Evan. Cool. Alrighty. So good. So there's, uh,

262
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh, audible is also doing something. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. We are really cranking, aren't we? I'm so excited about this. Oh, man.

263
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I can't wait. I can't wait to really get some stuff going. And I think that this, this, uh, this trip has been extremely,

264
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
fruitful, extremely fruitful. Okay. Let me see. Um, did that, uh, what are we at? You know, it's, oh,

265
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
geez, we're already 24 minutes into it. Well, then, of course, it's, uh,

266
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm counting casting with Adam Curry. Well, I'd say I don't get no respect, no respect at all.

267
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
At the unpolished guys, shows up in my bathroom the other day with a tape recorder. I started to sing in the show.

268
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And I hear him holler out. He's number one.

269
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Hi, Adam. And of course, hi, all 50,000 subscribers, but they be source code.

270
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
A little more. It's not for hit this number fifth. Hold on.

271
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yon, ever since we started with the hit test, dude, we're moving up close towards 80.

272
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So let's get started right away. This is number one.

273
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh, I know it one more time. I know what it is.

274
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I know. I get my five seconds here. I'll say 10 C C Wall Street shuffle.

275
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Number two is a bit longer. Here it is.

276
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And once again, I keep saying tears for fears, but this is, um,

277
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and let us say the page brothers Mr. Mr. with Kiri I lays on.

278
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And the final one, number three.

279
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
One more time.

280
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
No clue.

281
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That one I don't know, Yon, anywhere to bell.

282
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Time's up. Time for the enters. This is answer number one.

283
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's 10 C C and Wall Street shuffle.

284
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So that's answer number one.

285
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And this is answer number two.

286
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The Commodore.

287
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, shoot. It's the night shift.

288
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh man. Well, there's a mashup to be made. Night shift at Kiri LAZAR.

289
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Hint in.

290
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What's going on?

291
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Evermore, evermore.

292
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Going to be some sweet.

293
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
By that was, that was without winery, right?

294
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
He was a long gone.

295
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Lion and for the third answer.

296
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What is this?

297
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I really hope you got this one.

298
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I screwed it up.

299
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm not saying anything about this song.

300
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay.

301
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh man.

302
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's Patricia again.

303
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Of course.

304
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh man, I'm in so much fucking trouble again.

305
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Well, Adam, I hope you didn't screw up again.

306
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And this is why it's too late to hard again.

307
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Patricia Pie.

308
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Well, this concludes the hit list for today.

309
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000

313
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
See you next time, Adam, for number 16. Bye-bye.

314
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay, y'all.

315
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Look.

316
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Now we have some serious issues.

317
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh shit.

318
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm in so much crap now.

319
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can't believe it's the second time you've played a song by Patricia that I've missed.

320
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay.

321
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well, that's going to be a really nice homecoming.

322
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I can't wait to be homecoming.

323
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And I'm in trouble.

324
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Damn.

325
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Fod save music now on the source code.

326
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Nicholas Otto from Long Winter.

327
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Here's living on the edge on the David source code.

328
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Woody clips

329
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Same thing, no more but without the fear.

330
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Life double is getting dressed.

331
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,500
Night down in the sky and...

332
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,500
You can judge a wise man by the color of his skin

333
00:29:36,500 --> 00:30:02,500
You can judge a wise man by the color of his skin

334
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Dude, what the fuck was that?

335
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
That's lame.

336
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I thought there was a whole song.

337
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Oh man.

338
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Okay, well then I totally blew the production for it today.

339
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Didn't I?

340
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Hey listen.

341
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,500
Remember, I'm under no damn announcements, but keep your eye on it.

342
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
I put it on the organcurry.com.

343
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Just a thought.

344
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
All right, everybody, I'm off.

345
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I'm off the bed.

346
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
I'm wiped out.

347
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Time to catch some seeds.

348
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,500
As always, it's adamaccurry.com.

349
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Dailysourcecode.com.

350
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Dailysourcecode.com is we can find all the shares in the pod.

351
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Just power.

352
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,500
If you want to leave a comment on the weblog www.curry.com

353
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,500
And I will probably do an inflight podcast wrapping up the entire week

354
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,500
as I head home tomorrow

355
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,500
from SFO to plan.

356
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Let's get the outline into history.

357
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Oh, what's your mind?

358
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
I have to call a card to take me out.

359
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Thank you for reminding me.

360
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
And I'll probably be back

361
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,500
to stay inside New York around mid-mart.

362
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
So, looking forward to seeing you all again.

363
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Remember, no damn announcements.

364
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Bye bye.

365
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Bye bye.

366
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Thank you.
