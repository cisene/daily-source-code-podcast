Delta Shira Charley 2-1-2 something remarkable is happening here radio is springing free

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,800
of the regulated gatekeepers who managed what you can hear since radio is invented.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,200
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,200

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Hello everybody from San Francisco just in time for the weekend it's a source code.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Okay, I feel really, really bad because I have left y'all in the dark as in completely

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,200
radio silence but there's all a good explanation for it.

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Most of it has to do with human fatigue.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,200
It's the source code for the 22nd July 2005.

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,200
And I'm coming to you from San Francisco last time we spoke was Tuesday when I was in

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Curry Cottage.

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm not going to tell you what hotel I'm in.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,200
I've learned my lesson ever since iTunes launched whenever I tell you what I'm doing on the road

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
and where I'm staying.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
The phone starts ringing like 3 in the morning and I haven't quite got to that point where

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
I registered the hotel as Mr. Ben Dover.

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Anyway, we've got lots of stuff to talk about.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Lots of catching up to do.

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,200
We've got pod safe music and young pellets hit test all on the way.

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Okay, I'm just trying to think where I have to start.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,200
You know, it's been an amazing almost 72 hours.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Left Tuesday morning dropped Christina off at school and went straight off to the airport.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,200
So I'm going to check my microphone levels.

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Of course, I'm coming to you on the cast blaster, which I love to do when I'm on the road because everything

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,200
is so self-contained and everything just kind of works and I got all my stuff loaded up.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
I love it.

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:25,200
And basically 10 hour flight got in when straight from the airport to some meetings 24 hours of no sleep

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
which took me out for Thursday and Friday, which was today.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Well, I'll get into all of that.

31

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Hopefully you're still kind of ending up your work mode.

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,200

41

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
We learn and learn and learn

191
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
We learn and learn and learn

192
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
We learn and learn and learn

193
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
We learn and learn and learn

194
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Oh, you're a lonely butt

195
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
You can find that at mashuptown.com

196
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Eight doubles been sending me all kinds of cool stuff

197
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
And I'm loaded up for

198
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Certainly for the next couple of weeks

199
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I've got mashups but do not hesitate at all

200
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
The send your mashups in mashup at podshow.com

201
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
This is the daily source code

202
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I'm gonna try and play catch up with you

203
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
See if we can

204
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Woo

205
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Man

206
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I'm in stand-up mode actually today

207
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
I figured that's about the only way I could see right now

208
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,200
It's a six thirty p.m. Friday afternoon

209
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Early evening of course in San Francisco

210
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
I am so tired

211
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I can't tell you how tired I am

212
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
So yeah, so

213
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Plain ride

214
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Let me just do it in chronological order

215
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,200
That's probably the best way that I can keep track of all this stuff

216
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Upper deck

217
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Virgin upper deck

218
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Unlike their mobile phone service

219
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Which interestingly enough

220
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I was reading the financial times

221
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
The UK financial times

222
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
On the airplane

223
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
And there was this article about the virgin mobile

224
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
As you know, I've had some

225
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Well, I had some

226
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Not only to have some problems with them

227
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
But I dropped them as my carrier for my phone service

228
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
And actually I thought about it

229
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
You know, there's probably

230
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Anywhere from, you know, like 13 to 15 thousand

231
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Dollars worth of revenue that they lost

232
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Simply by just not being able to deal with me as a customer

233
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
And it's a technical problem

234
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
You know, there are virtual mobile operator

235
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
They ride on top of T-Mobile

236
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
And they just couldn't figure out how to un-blacklist my phone

237
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,200
No problem, so I'm a very satisfied T-Mobile customer now

238
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,200
But I was reading that last year they had 150,000 new sign-ups

239
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,200
In this period and this year it's 75,000 sign-ups

240
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
So it makes sense if there's any analyst listening

241
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,200
There you go, and now they say they're concentrating on

242
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
What is it? The concentrating on the higher

243
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,200
On the upper level of their customers

244
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
So people who spend a lot of money

245
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I think if I'm spending $15,000 a year on

246
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
On phone calls that I would probably fall in that category

247
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
But you know, they got some work to do

248
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Anyway, so their airline virgin airlines

249
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
I'm still, or a virgin Atlantic

250
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm still very happy with it

251
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
It was great actually

252
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Two times in a row, I don't know how it works

253
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
But they have a massage service on board

254
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
And of course, you know, there's probably about 50 people who all want the massage

255
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
And they can only do

256
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
There's one masseuse typically

257
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
On a flight and they can only do so many people

258
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
So I did get my shot this time

259
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Which was great because man, my shoulder

260
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
It's much, much better

261
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Thank you so much

262
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm still getting so many emails from people who identify

263
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
With exactly this problem

264
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,200
We were even saying, oh, you know, I've had this, but never really thought about what it could be

265
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
There's no pain actually, there's very little pain involved

266
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
But sometimes I can just feel my

267
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
You know, the tendons or muscle, whatever it is, my shoulder

268
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Tighten up, going to some kind of like spasm

269
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
And then immediately my whole arm

270
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Starts to tingle and starts to go numb

271
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
And I have some exercises now that I have to do

272
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Which I think I did them for you

273
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Didn't do them last week, we pushed your chin back

274
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Into your neck like gratins

275
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
It's not very attractive when you do that

276
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Because then you get like triple chin

277
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Oh my god, just caught a little glimpse of that in the mirror

278
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Let's see, so I actually did some work on the flight over

279
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Hopefully by now you've had a chance to check out our first shadow cast of Spike Lee

280
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
It's listed prominently in iTunes

281
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
And you can subscribe to the podcast

282
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
There'll be four episodes

283
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
And I was editing episode number two

284
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Which will be out this coming Tuesday

285
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,200
You've probably got a good taste of what this Spike Lee podcast of

286
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Inside man is all about with our shadow cast or human Newman

287
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Who just kills me with his narration

288
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I really love listening to that

289
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
So give it a listen if you haven't checked it out yet

290
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
So I did some editing, which was great, you know

291
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
You've got their in-seat power

292
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
And you can really get a lot of work done

293
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Very, very comfortable doing that

294
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Very luxurious in their in their seats

295
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Where you kind of you can even recline during takeoff and landing

296
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Which I totally appreciate

297
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Also watch two movies

298
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I finally got the C-Ray

299
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Which I hadn't seen yet

300
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
About the life and times of

301
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Of Ray Charles

302
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
I was really good

303
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I was a good movie

304
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I understand why it was an award-winning movie

305
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I was nice

306
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Although there was a lot of stuff in there

307
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I felt they focused really heavily on the hero and aspect

308
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
And you know those days

309
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Back in the late 50s and 60s

310
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Everybody was screwing everybody on the road

311
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
And doing all kinds of drugs

312
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
And it wasn't really out of the ordinary

313
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
And I thought the movie focused quite heavily on that

314
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
But I loved seeing a lot of the

315
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
You know the technological improvement in the music scene

316
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Where Ray got his willets

317
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Or the first eight track recordings

318
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
And man the guy is just a musical genius

319
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
And of course seeing Quincy Jones

320
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Or actor portraying Quincy Jones

321
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
And part of how that story all came together

322
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
That was very enjoyable

323
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,200
So I watched that and also watched Hitch

324
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Which is the Will Smith movie

325
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
That was cute

326
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
That was very cute watching that

327
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
It actually inspired me to have a dirty vodka

328
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Martini

329
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
With all of us when I got to San Francisco

330
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Anyway so I got in around 2 o'clock

331
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Ron picked me up

332
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
And we had some very important meetings

333
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Which unfortunately

334
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
That we've got the no-dam announcement

335
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Rule still in effect on that

336
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
But let me tell you this much

337
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I'll be making a whole bunch of phone calls today

338
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
And tomorrow and over the weekend

339
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
To a number of people that we've been working with

340
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Over the past months

341
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
And I've got great news to report to them

342
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
And once everyone's informed

343
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Then we'll start announcing

344
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Some of this great stuff that we have to talk about

345
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
So that we have to talk about

346
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
So I'm very very excited

347
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
It's been great

348
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
But by the time I got back in the hotel

349
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
It was 11 o'clock

350
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
So I've been up for more than 24 hours

351
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I didn't have it in me at all

352
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
To create a source code

353
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Then I had to get up early

354
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Because actually I didn't just have to record a source code

355
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I had to create the podcast

356
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Ali Top 10

357
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Which aired today on serious satellite

358
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
In fact, it's running as we speak

359
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Very excited about that

360
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
A lot of good vibes

361
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,200
And I think it's really for the serious satellite listeners

362
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
It's going to be exciting

363
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,200
And what we're working on with the press department

364
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
And serious is really publishing this list

365
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
And getting it into several publications on a regular basis

366
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,200
So that there can be a wide distribution of the knowledge

367
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Of what the top 10 podcasts are

368
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
And what I like about this top 10

369
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Is it truly is a listener-based top 10

370
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Now sure

371
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
People are, you know, enticing

372
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
And begging almost

373
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Their listeners to go and vote for them

374
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
And podcast Ali

375
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
But I'm fine with that

376
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
You know, by the way

377
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I'm not in the top 10

378
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Dawn and Drew are in there though

379
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
So if you have a chance

380
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Look out for that list

381
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
And you can always go to podcastali.com

382
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
And check it out for yourself

383
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
And vote for your favorite podcast for sure

384
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
So I did that

385
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
I had to do that

386
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
And I was just two tired

387
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Two tired

388
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
So I got up Thursday morning

389
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Around the 630

390
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I hooked up with PETA

391
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Who had basically pre-produced everything

392
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
It was ready to go

393
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
And it was weird

394
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Because the first thing he said

395
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
When I skyped him as he said

396
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
And if you see the news about London

397
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
And I'm like, oh, Christ now

398
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
So of course, by now

399
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
We all know about what's

400
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
What's that noise?

401
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Oh, is that my computer?

402
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Yeah

403
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I have the window open

404
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
I'm on the 15th floor of the hotel

405
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
So you may hear some typical San Francisco sounds

406
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
In the background

407
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm just

408
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Oh, that's just work outside

409
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I guess

410
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Not hearing someone

411
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Some working crew

412
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Ah

413
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Where was I?

414
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Okay, so that you know, heard about the

415
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
The failed bombing attempts in London

416
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
And so of course

417
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I immediately hopped on with Patricia

418
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
And talked to her about it

419
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
And

420
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Man, this is pretty messed up

421
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
This is

422
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
It's funny, you know

423
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
For years

424
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I've been watching television reports

425
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
And news reports

426
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
And we've seen what's been happening

427
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
In Israel

428
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
And with the suicide bombings there

429
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
And all of a sudden it's like, you know, hey

430
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
The world truly has become a smaller place

431
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Because

432
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
We've got the same shit here

433
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
And

434
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Well, not necessarily here

435
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
But in the UK, of course

436
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
We had

437
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
You know, what happens in September

438
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
11th

439
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
And the world has definitely changed

440
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
You know

441
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
And there's lots of

442
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Well, I hope we have some damn good leaders

443
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Who can really help us through these times

444
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
And work on these problems

445
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
And, you know, it's not going to be

446
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Travilion

447
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
It may be a problem that we're stuck with

448
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
For the next 50 years

449
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
But

450
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
You know, I'm no political analyst

451
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
But I'll tell you

452
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
When it comes down to it

453
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
And the only recourse people have

454
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
For whatever their frustrations are

455
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Is

456
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Blowing themselves up

457
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
You know, then

458
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
We've got some serious serious issues

459
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
So

460
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
That said

461
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Onto the more fun stuff

462
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
To did all that stuff

463
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
That I had to do

464
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Production-wise

465
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
And by the way, I'm really enjoying that

466
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
You have no idea how

467
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Incredibly enjoyable it is to me

468
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
For someone who's been

469
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Creating radio shows

470
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Since I was 14 years old

471
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,200
To have almost come full circle

472
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
You know, I used to do stuff in my bedroom

473
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
And I'd be recording it

474
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
And then

475
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Have little transmitters

476
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
And later became bigger transmitters

477
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
And those were illegal

478
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
And later it was all legalized

479
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
And I was getting paid for it

480
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
And now we're kind of, you know, back full circle

481
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
And back in the bedroom

482
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Yeah, now it's all digital

483
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
I don't have turn tables anymore

484
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
But

485
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
You know, it's still in the bedroom

486
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
And I'm not getting paid for it

487
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
So that's how we've come full circle

488
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
It's pretty nice

489
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Let's see

490
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
We had

491
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Strategy session

492
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
With a couple of people

493
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Who were out on the west coast

494
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Operational

495
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
That is for

496
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
For pod show

497
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Which of course is all based

498
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
To part

499
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
I was all a part of the

500
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
No Dam announcements

501
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
News that I'll just stop talking

502
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
About since I'll probably only make

503
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Only piss you off that I'm

504
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Teasing it but can't tell you what it is yet

505
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
But within the next two weeks

506
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
That'll all become very apparent

507
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
And one of the important things that

508
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
I came out for

509
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Wasn't meeting with Apple

510
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Now

511
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
I think I told you

512
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Last time we spoke Tuesday

513
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
That, you know,

514
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Mads Weinstein

515
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Among other people

516
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I've said, well, you know,

517
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Look at what Apple's done

518
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
How come you're not

519
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
You know, yelling at the top of your lungs

520
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
About how they've messed this up

521
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Or haven't done this right or haven't done that right

522
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
And I'll tell you, you know,

523
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,200
That is a, that I think is a

524
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Need jerk reaction

525
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
What I really wanted to do

526
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Which, you know, which I was very happy

527
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I did is I wanted to go talk to the people

528
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
At Apple and see what was going on

529
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,200
And coordinate and find out what some of the issues were

530
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I tell you

531
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I was so pleasantly surprised

532
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
When I met with

533
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Not all but

534
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Major portion of the iTunes podcasting team

535
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
And then the iTunes really

536
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
The iTunes music store team

537
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
And some of the engineers

538
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
And the strategists and people working on the directory

539
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,200
We went through all of the features and services

540
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,200
And processes that the podcast and community

541
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Has been working on for over a year

542
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
And some of them Apple just wasn't aware of

543
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Or the team just wasn't aware of

544
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,200
And other ones they actually were quite aware of

545
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
And have been working on it and, you know,

546
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
You know what the biggest problem is

547
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
This is, it's not really a problem

548
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,200
But this is so new for a company like Apple

549
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
To actually they have to kind of, you know,

550
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
We'll do a couple of interesting things

551
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
They have to really be listening to their

552
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
To their customers at this point

553
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
And of course they listen to their customers

554
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
But their customers have a year head start

555
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Which is new for them

556
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
They have to be much more forthcoming with

557
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Information

558
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
And they don't have a feedback loop

559
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
And you know a downstream feedback loop

560
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Traditionally always done through PR and marketing

561
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
And advertising in fact

562
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
And so, you know, to open up a channel

563
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
It may seem very simple to think, you know,

564
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Hey, they should just do a weblog

565
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Or they should do a podcast or, you know,

566
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Where's the Steve Jobs podcast

567
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,200
But it's not in the DNA of companies like Apple

568
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
And what I did see though

569
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Is they want to program that into their DNA

570
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
You know, you can almost see like

571
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
They've got the helix there

572
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
And they're trying to insert little molecules

573
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Whatever the heck it is

574
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
And I was really encouraged by that

575
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
I'll just give you a couple of

576
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
A couple of things we talked about

577
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
We talked about opml

578
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Import and export or subscription list

579
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
We talked about statistics of feeds

580
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
We talked about the updating of the feeds

581
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
We talked about using some existing infrastructure

582
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,200
And what we've agreed to

583
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Is that

584
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I will

585
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Well, we agreed to so much

586
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I really want to try and help them

587
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Learn how to communicate into the community

588
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
And you know, of course I said, well

589
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Steve Jobs should do a podcast

590
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
I know if he's going to do a regular podcast

591
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
But he should give it a whack, you know

592
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
And we should look at how

593
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
How you're building the directory

594
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
And I have to say

595
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
I was extremely encouraged

596
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
But, you know, don't forget

597
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
There are people inside of Apple, you know

598
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
And the human beings

599
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,200
And they're being deluged with all kinds of

600
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Input from all over the place

601
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
From phone calls to, you know, to emails

602
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
And people who are upset

603
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Worried pissed off

604
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Disappointed

605
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
I think there are also many who are extremely happy

606
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
In fact, when I entered the country

607
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
And I went through customs

608
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
The customs officer looked at me and said, dude

609
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I just saw the podcasting tab in my eye

610
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
And I'm loving it, you know

611
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
So there's a lot of good stuff there as well

612
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,200
In fact, I think there's much more good than that

613
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
It's just, you know, we're a very vocal community

614
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,200
And my God, we're actually using our vocal cords

615
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,200
So, you know, I guess all I can tell you

616
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
You have to give it a little time, you know

617
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Here's a company that has jumped right into the fray

618
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
They recognize and realize that

619
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
They didn't get everything right

620
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
And they have a lot to learn and they're in learning mode

621
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,200
And I really am very positive about that

622
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
And we even talked about content delivery

623
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
And we talked about Bitcoin

624
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
We talked about a whole bunch of things

625
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,200
And it's not my position to tell you what they're doing

626
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Unless they explicitly tell me that

627
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,200
That I can and they've promised me that as they bring new features online

628
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,200
That they're going to start sending that message out

629
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
And I will gladly help them with that communication

630
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
So, I'm psyched about it

631
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I really, really am psyched about it

632
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
And I was apprehensive, I have to tell you right up front

633
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
I was like, oh man, you know

634
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
We'll get some of this stuff right

635
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,200
And I really have a good feeling about it

636
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
And they're also learning about what makes a good aggregator

637
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
And what people use their feeds for

638
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,200
And how important subscription information is

639
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,200
As a feedback mechanism to content producers

640
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,200
But also, you know, it's some technical stuff

641
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,200
But I learned a lot about why feeds weren't updating in a timely manner

642
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
And there's some infrastructure stuff there that we talked about

643
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,200
And I pointed them to some infrastructure that we've already created

644
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Within the podcast in community

645
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
That they can use right now today to make that better

646
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
And I think it was just, it was the right conversation

647
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
At the right time

648
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,200
And I'm excited about what is going to be coming in the next couple of weeks

649
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
But make no mistake, it's going to take time

650
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Developing software takes time, developing services takes time

651
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,200
They have partners that they work with

652
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
That have to change their processes as well

653
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Aquaman, I've talked about Aquaman a lot

654
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
And some of the issues that we run up against

655
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
And this is all new stuff, you know

656
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Even content delivery networks have never really

657
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I mean, this is when podcasting

658
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,200
You know, I'm going to put this podcasting has a

659
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Band with them request curve that is almost the severe as when a new

660
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Windows update comes out, you know, and all these

661
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Hundreds of millions of machines around the world

662
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Start updating their Windows software

663
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,200
This is big, big stuff and even I'm surprised

664
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,200
By what this is taking resource-wise

665
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
And you know what?

666
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
We have a lot of stuff to fix

667
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
We have a lot of our damn announcements

668
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,200
We'll communicate how we hope to fix a lot of the issues

669
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
One of them being bandwidth

670
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Because, you know, if the case is

671
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,200
If we have a situation where an independent podcast

672
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Can't be listed or promoted through for instance

673
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
iTunes or some other big avenue

674
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Because then they run out of bandwidth

675
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
And they basically take it off the air

676
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Then podcasting is going to fail

677
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
It's going to be, well, it's not going to fail

678
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,200
But it's not the way it should work

679
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
You know, that should not be an issue

680
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,200
And I think we have some ways to really help the community

681
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,200
To make sure that everybody has a fair shot

682
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,200
And that everybody can be pointed to by iTunes

683
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
And not go off the air

684
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,200
And everybody can enjoy a global audience

685
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Jumping on board with them

686
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Oh, that's one thing I want to mention

687
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I'm going to skip water here

688
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
This is Fiji water

689
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Five blocks of bottle, my goodness

690
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Something that I didn't, I wasn't aware

691
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,200
But something that I'm happy to pass on

692
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
The top 10 list on the top 10 podcast list and iTunes

693
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
First of all, there's, you know, there's

694
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I think there's 15 different countries

695
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
So there's 15 different

696
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,200
versions of iTunes, not just the music store

697
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
But also podcasting and localized top 10 list

698
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
So in the Netherlands, you'll see a different top 10

699
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Then in the UK, which will be a different top 10

700
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Then in the US

701
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,200
And that is a top 10, which is, and here it comes

702
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Just so you know how that works

703
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Because I don't think that was explained very well

704
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
It's a top 10 of new subscriptions

705
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
To podcasts within roughly the last 24 hours

706
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
So that's why you can see things shooting up the charts

707
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
And it also is really, and I have to agree with this

708
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
It's a pretty fair way of doing it

709
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm no statistician, but it's a pretty fair way of doing things

710
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,200
So that, you know, when a new podcast comes online

711
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Or, you know, it catches on

712
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
And people start subscribing to it

713
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
It really will

714
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Start to

715
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Propagate into the top 10

716
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
And by the way, that data also

717
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
I believe is going to start to flow out of Apple

718
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
So again, new stuff for them, new stuff for us

719
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
And I'm looking on looking very much forward to continue

720
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Work with Apple on doing this

721
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,200
So we also released, as you know, pod finder

722
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
2 pod finder 3 will be up on Tuesday

723
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
And it's funny

724
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I got a wonderful email from

725
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
I think it's Clark Boyd

726
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Who works in public radio

727
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
And also works for the BBC

728
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
And he said

729
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
And he said, hey, you know, how come you're not promoting

730
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Any of the public radio stuff?

731
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Oh my goodness, you know, now

732
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
We've been promoting the indie podcasters so much

733
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Now everyone, sorry, I don't know what to do

734
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I just want everyone to hear as many podcasts as possible

735
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Much out there as as humanly possible

736
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
And it's, you know, on serious satellite

737
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
We get four hours a day

738
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
On the pod finder, it's, you know, an hour a week

739
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Or whatever we can make it

740
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
And it's about 10 to 15 different podcasts

741
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
We're just going to keep on tracking, keep on promoting

742
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Keep on pushing it out there

743
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Any suggestions, we'll be more than welcome

744
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Okay

745
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
I want to play some music for you

746
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
I was searching through the pod safe music network

747
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
And came across

748
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Let's see

749
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,200
From a California

750
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
It's a dream of thought

751
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
I believe is the way you pronounce it

752
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Our debut album is titled Elusive

753
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Let me see

754
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Her influences

755
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
This is kind of some interesting info we've got here

756
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Sarah McLaughlin, McLaughlin, McLaughlin, how do I pronounce that?

757
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Toriamos, Coldplay

758
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
You kind of get the picture when you start to listen to the tune

759
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
And I think you like it

760
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Nightfly, fly

761
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Andryna Thorpe, pod safe

762
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
On your daddy's source code

763
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
And I'm blue, that'll sky

764
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Rolls, it's days, it's been in sight of my mind

765
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,200
And as I float through the midst

766
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Or I'll balloon me, it seems to far behind

767
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Like I can fly

768
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Fly, fly, I love these seems to matter

769
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Let you hear beside me

770
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,200
If you're here for a new year

771
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Would you feel like you?

772
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,200
And all the cars wouldn't bite

773
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
And motion the same light

774
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,200
They could be parallel

775
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
And the light inside me

776
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Feels so bright, it's hot for me

777
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
And tonight

778
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Like I can do fly

779
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Fly, fly, fly

780
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Fly, I love these seems to matter

781
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Let you hear beside me

782
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,200
If you're here for a new year

783
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Would you feel like you?

784
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,200
And all the cars wouldn't bite

785
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,200
And as I float through the midst

786
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Or I'll balloon me, it seems to far behind

787
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Like I can do fly

788
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
I love these seems to matter

789
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Let you hear beside me

790
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
If you're here for a new year

791
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Would you feel like you?

792
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
And all the cars wouldn't bite

793
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
And as I float through the midst

794
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Or I'll balloon me, it seems to far behind

795
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Like I can do fly

796
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Fly, fly, fly, fly

797
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Fly, fly, fly

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Than seems to better

803
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
You're here for scenting me

804
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Fly, fly, fly, fly

805
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:50,200
When I'm here with you I'd feel like

806
00:30:50,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Fly, fly, fly, pad, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

807
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:38,200
on the daily source code, definitely go over and check out the Podsafe music network. I was looking at the, let me go in there, let me see with the, I don't get the most pod play. I was very interesting, because I really see the system. Let's see.

808
00:31:38,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Top of the list here, brother love summertime, we've played that bill, sound scientist, transfer how hazardous we are, brother love with push, I played that a while while ago, Rob Costlow still, whoops, second my, oh man, I want to do that, my browser just kind of freak out. Here we go, two era with filled, another Rob Costlow song in the top 10, the most pod play, which is family, haven't actually played that one before.

809
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:34,200
This one, Adrina Thorpe, Fly Fly Fly Fly, Chan, say what you will and another Rob Costlow, man, three Rob Costlow's in the most played on Podcast. Let me just see who's playing, so Adrina Thorpe, I think, can I, I should be able to go check out and see who else has played Adrina, home on a second, let me just check, oh wait, that's, boy, I'm missing this all up, aren't I?

810
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:45,200
There's still a couple of things that I'd like to work differently, not everywhere within the pod safe music network, is it possible to immediately go to that band's page?

811
00:32:45,200 --> 00:33:01,200
I don't think so, I haven't figured out how to do it, so hold on, let me see, who's playing, who else is playing Adrina? Oh, it's interesting while I'm searching for this, hold on a second, so I would have to play Fly Fly Fly, let's see.

812
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Oh man, connectivity here is sucking. Well, while that's loading, I got a note, it was actually, wasn't a very polite note, it kind of said, you know, dear Adam, very disappointed that, you know, you haven't taken the blind casters, the blind listeners into account on the pod safe music network,

813
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:41,200
because the registration process is not accessible for the blind. Hey, you know what, we messed up, but guess what, we fixed it, or at least we put a fix in that is workable and did that almost immediately.

814
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:59,200
What we got to do is just ask, you know, not to be too nasty about it, so hopefully that's better, and it's, you know, it's amazing, we all kind of like hit our forehead, it's going, oh my God, you know, how, how could we mess that up, such a sense for such advocates and, and dude, this is audio, we should know a lot better than that.

815
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:22,200
So that is fixed, got a nice email from Andrew Sylvester, and it was, it's just a little thing, but I thought that I'd pass it on to you because he, he said I was, he was listening to daily source code and heard me struggle with the Celsius or centigrade to Fahrenheit temperature conversion and he has an easy trick on how to do that conversion.

816
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I just want to give it to you because it's one of those things, it's real handy, once you know it, then, you know, then you can kind of use it forever.

817
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:41,200
So if you want to go from centigrade to Fahrenheit, you double it and add 30, so if it's 25 degrees centigrade, you double it, which would mean it would be 50 and you add 30, which mean it would be 80 degrees.

818
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:53,200
If you want to go the reverse, all you do is you subtract 30 and then divide it in half, and then you obviously come up with the centigrade number.

819
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Now, it's not completely accurate, but it does put you within, you know, like plus or minus 34 degrees, but it's just something really handy when just, you know, you need to know real quick, and hopefully we'll get one of those simple ones for gallons to leaders, one of these days,

820
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,200
because man, I'm lost on that as well, what else did I have?

821
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Oh, Christine, the finished school, her year is up, so vacations officially started, our plans are to go to the states that I told you the first week of August.

822
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:36,200
August, first actually, Patricia and I have been invited to a party, the Playboy UK party in London, and I've actually been asked to do a sound seeing tour of it.

823
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:45,200
So, beyond the lookout for that, I'm pretty excited, but Christine, I had a great report card, very excited.

824
00:35:45,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Here's a kid who came into a new environment, a new country, a new school, halfway through the school year, hadn't even had Spanish ever in her life, which is one of, you know, which is language she had to take this year, and she got her SATs back, which are very comparable to the SATs in the US, and she did fantastic job.

825
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I'm so incredibly proud of her, I'm just so proud of her. She's been great. What a trooper and a half, she is, really is. Okay, let's go.

826
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,200
You're so disgusting with Adam, you're bringing John, it's time for the hip-tooth with y'all, Poles.

827
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Hey, John.

828
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Hello?

829
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Hey Adam, they take this number 49.

830
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,200
And the clips and answers are edited by Richard.

831
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Okay.

832
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,200
So that means there are a few 70 songs in there as well.

833
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Yeah.

834
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
And it gets your guys to the intro.

835
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Number 1.

836
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
All right.

837
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Oh, come on.

838
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
This is one of my favorites.

839
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
This is a very easy one.

840
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,200
That's the motel's suddenly last summer.

841
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Suddenly one summer.

842
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Suddenly last summer, I think it is.

843
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
And this is number two.

844
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,200
It's a steely Dan.

845
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Do it again.

846
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Oh, this is going to be a fun one.

847
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Can't wait to hear the answers.

848
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
And the final one is number three.

849
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Oh, yes.

850
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Of course.

851
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
You can use a congenius.

852
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
We all should know this one.

853
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
That's the Stevie Wonder.

854
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Superstition.

855
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I've got my Boeing ready.

856
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Oops.

857
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Time's up. This is answer number one.

858
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
Okay.

859
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,200
From 1983, the motel.

860
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Yeah.

861
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
And he does number 49.

862
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Suddenly, last summer.

863
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
For a short time.

864
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Oh.

865
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,200
One summer, never ends.

866
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,200
It takes all my wings and so many.

867
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Last summer.

868
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Okay. Number two.

869
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Last summer.

870
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
And so number one.

871
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
The motel.

872
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
And this is answer number two.

873
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
And hit this number 49.

874
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
It's a song from 1972.

875
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
And it's from Steely Dan.

876
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
This is doing it again.

877
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Yeah. Two for two.

878
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,200
We're going to learn.

879
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
We're going to learn.

880
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Back.

881
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Yeah.

882
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Down.

883
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Now we're going to see.

884
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Steely Dan.

885
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
And number three.

886
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,200
And this is answer number three.

887
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,200
From 1973, there's a superstition.

888
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Steely Wonder.

889
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
Yep.

890
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
We create.

891
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,760
What a classic!

892
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,340
Awesome!

893
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:49,240
