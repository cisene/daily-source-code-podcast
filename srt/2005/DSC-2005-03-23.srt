00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,060
All right, everybody. How you doing? Welcome to the Daily Source Code. Today is the 23rd of March

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:17,380
2005. It's a little bit past 8 o'clock. PM. I am at Super Airport Amsterdam. Oh, a second.

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:38,380
Let me just do a couple of my dying. Well, people looking at me kind of strange.

4
00:00:47,380 --> 00:01:02,380
All righty. Here we go. I'm just going to take a little walk. Walk with me if you don't mind.

5
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,380
Groovy. Now, let's talk for a bit. Let me walk outside if we can talk a little more.

6
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:24,380
Finally. Because I am way early for my flight. Oh, man. Let me tell you, I've been playing hooky. Big time.

7
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:34,380
I feel almost guilty, really. Let me tell you about the past two days. First of all, apologies for no source code yesterday.

8
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:46,380
What can I tell you? It was a really, really busy day. Been moving in office in Holland and actually some of the reconfiguration myself of the computers.

9
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,380
Which I can pretty good at. I'm pretty good at this Windows stuff, too. Windows networking. It's so much fun.

10
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:04,380
So I had some meetings with some lawyers and stuff. Not particularly all fun stuff. I did go out shopping for Patricia. I bought her a really, really, really beautiful gift.

11
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:15,380
If you don't mind me saying so, I bought her a brand new watch. She's been looking for a new watch.

12
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:25,380
One that basically that has all the right fashion and style comments and accoutrements. But at the same time, one which actually read time.

13
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:36,380
And believe it or not, I did a little bit of shopping yesterday. You'd be amazed at how many extremely expensive watches require to be wound by hand.

14
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:43,380
Is that crazy or what? I mean, it's okay if you may buy an expensive watch, but then have to wind it by hand that makes no sense.

15
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:51,380
It's just like, I'd taxi Eric with me and he was flipping out. He said, what? They want that much for this watch and you have to wind yourself.

16
00:02:51,380 --> 00:03:00,380
And actually, that's a mistake I made in the past. On the time piece I once bought and discovered later that it was, you had to wind it manually.

17
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,380
And he's like, well, that's, that's, you know, what's, what is up with that?

18
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:15,380
So I got her a new watch, a Chanel watch actually. She's her favorite scent is Chanel number five.

19
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:29,380
So I kind of went on brand instinct there. Beautiful with a ceramic band and has a little rose colored sapphires.

20
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:41,380
I mean, really fucking beautiful. But of course, it's our anniversary coming up fifth of April, as well as her birthday on the seventh of April. So, hey, you know, it's been a while that we've been married.

21
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,380
Will it be 18 years now? Holy moly. Thanks for 17 or 18 years, I guess.

22
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:54,380
So that was the fun part. And then I went to the hotel last night. I had some dinner with some friends.

23
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:01,380
I talked about the future TV project that I've kind of been helping out with more on the sales side than anything, not really on production.

24
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,380
I guess I'd be like executive producer, which means I kind of help out sell it.

25
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,380
So that's going very well.

26
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,380
God, I got a headache right on the left side of my forehead.

27
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:23,380
So, went to bed probably, I don't know, around one, something like that.

28
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:34,380
And got up at 630, early call, because I was meeting the wing commander, wing commander William, my flight instructor and good friend.

29
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:56,380
For some serious, serious flight training today, you know, I remember I told you that I was just impossible to get anyone to give me instruction in the UK near we live, at least not FAA, which is the kind of license I already have in FAA pilots license for helicopters.

30
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,380
And we actually went training on the aircraft that I'm going to buy at the end of the year.

31
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:16,380
Session of 182 RG stands for Attractable Gear, which means it's a complex aircraft, a constant speed propeller, you know, all that kind of stuff.

32
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:25,380
So you got to imagine that this is, especially if you're not used to it, it's a real intense experience.

33
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:34,380
It's very, very physical, because of course you're anything but relaxed while you're flying something that you've never flown before, don't know really what the fuck you're doing.

34
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:45,380
So, see, first we start off with some basic technical stuff about the plane. Oh, and by the way, I said, hey man, I want a podcast all this. You said, you know what?

35
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:54,380
You don't want to be that embarrassed, because I'm really going to embarrass your ass. I said, but maybe that would be good. He said, you're also not going to have any time to think about anything, you know what he was right.

36
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:04,380
Whew, so we took off, you know, kind of get accustomed to the aircraft. Then we went down to the south of the country, to Midasaylund.

37
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:16,380
And did several touching goes. Nice, real nice grass, air strip there, had a cup of coffee, and then went off to Tesla, which is way up at the top of the country.

38
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:22,380
There's a band of islands and there's a nice airport up there where you can have a great lunch.

39
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Did the four touching goes there? And, well, that was the first embarrassment happened there when we were coming down. I guess it's coming down a little too steep.

40
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:47,380
William said, nose up, nose up, and I pulled the nose up. And, you know, if he hadn't put in some throttle, we would have had a very noisy landing and probably would've broken the wheels right off of it.

41
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:56,380
And, of course, you know, when you do that, the tower is watching. Everyone who's having lunch is watching, so that's a great way to get extremely humbled.

42
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:08,380
Had our lunch, then flew off, and then did some instrument training, which is, that's funny, basically then blocks, you know, so you're flying along right, and then he takes this,

43
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:21,380
what he did, he did it with the map, takes it takes the map, and blocks off all the wind shields, so you can't see anything.

44
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:29,380
And then says, okay, turn 360 degrees over left, 30 degrees bank, you know, and so you're completely flying on instruments, can't see anything.

45
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:38,380
It's the weirdest sensation, you know, because you're basically, you're flying a flight simulator, only you could really mess it up.

46
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,380
So that was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed that. And then, man, this is like four hours into it.

47
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Going back to Hilversum, which is kind of the television city here in the Netherlands, and did another couple touching goes.

48
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:02,380
Now, this is an airfield that I'm very used to, and I've flown into with the helicopter, many, many, many, many times.

49
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:14,380
Boy, is it different when you're coming in with a reasonably powered aircraft, and there's like no wind, and it's a very short field, and at one point, the tower even came on the rail, and said,

50
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:35,380
hey, how to make sure you don't, don't make William nauseous dude, I was a mess, and it's also at a certain point, you just can't, you know, you're tired, you're, there's too much going on, that's a lot to do in the aircraft, which is all new, when you're landing, you know, you've got your flaps and your gear and your speed, and you're, you're just so much.

51
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:45,380
So, kind of ended on like a downer, which is, I guess it's kind of good, because that's, it makes, gives you a lot of food for thought.

52
00:08:45,380 --> 00:09:03,380
We actually were going to fly all the way home to, to the airport nearby Gilford, which is Farrogs. Unfortunately, we would need customs, which normally isn't a problem, but then you kind of have to call it earlier, so I still had an easy jet ticket just in case.

53
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,380
So, I was done around six, and I've been at the airport for about an hour and a half now.

54
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:16,380
It's typical, so I'm going to take easy jet home, but you can't check in until, what is an hour and a half before the flight?

55
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,380
It's literally no one at the check-in counter, which of course is good, because that's why they make it, how they make it so cheap, right?

56
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:30,380
And of course, the same people who check you in are the people who take your ticket at the gate, and sometimes even on the aircraft is flight attendants,

57
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:38,380
but I love that system, you know, I'm not just a user of easy jet, I'm also a shareholder, and I really love their format and their service.

58
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:52,380
So, then we'll be off to Gatwick, I'll leave around 10, and I arrive at 10, because it's only 40 minutes flight, and we gain an hour, traveling towards the west,

59
00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:02,380
so we picked that up, and then I'll be home before 11 o'clock, and then I'm just going to crash, I'm going to take a nice long hot shower and hop into bed, up early tomorrow,

60
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:12,380
because two more really, really busy days, we're closing contracts, so that I can make some damn announcements pretty soon.

61
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:22,380
She's, I mean, just talking on the phone and on Skype really so much, that's I love doing that, I've said that before, but man is that stuff work,

62
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:32,380
I just, you know, being here and having to do some stuff on the cell phones, I don't have connectivity outside the terminal, reminds me what a pain in the acid is, and how expensive it is.

63
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:42,380
So, that'll be for tomorrow and Friday, I'll have a quote unquote regularly scheduled podcast for you, got promos and all kinds of stuff to play,

64
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:50,380
and that's actually the thing that bums me out about kind of being out of pocket for a day and a half is I just will have so much email to catch up on, it's crazy,

65
00:10:50,380 --> 00:11:01,380
you know, it's going to take me hours to catch up on and I'm already way over a thousand messages on red, it's, I'm out of control, I really am.

66
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:11,380
What's this coming up here, when you put the glasses on, I took my glasses off, because they, they're part of the source of the headache, I was a cleaning machine,

67
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:22,380
hold on a second, maybe I should move my, it's a big cleaning truck, it's cleaning the side walk out here outside the terminal, hold on let me get out of the way.

68
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:43,380
Actually, let them go by, see if I can enjoy the sound of the cleaning machine, here comes, like a truck with brushes, the city cat live busher, hey, you know what, you want to go in and they'll like to turn it off for a second, listen to some conversations, I'll be kind of fun.

69
00:11:52,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Following the cleaning truck, into the revolving north.

70
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
There we go.

71
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:15,380
Okay, doing the old phone trick, because people do recognize me here, and they already think I'm weird,

72
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,380
but totally think I'm a bonkers of them talking to myself.

73
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:27,380
It's funny, podcasting is slow to catch on in the Netherlands, that's kind of the interesting thing, since it was kind of born in this region,

74
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:39,380
but there was so much going on in the Dutch press at the time, basically the international press for me, the US press, was catching on and writing articles, we had some major shit here in Holland,

75
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:57,380
you know, Dale von Hoch, the film director, who was assassinated, there's all kinds of stuff going on with the government here, people are very unhappy, there's just a, I'd say a general unrest going on.

76
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,380
Let's just see, where's the easy jet check in?

77
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,380
It's Martin there, what's this here?

78
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,380
I wonder, where is easy jet?

79
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:24,380
I might have the right spot, oh my second, bear with me, this is interesting, let's go look at the, maybe someone's already there,

80
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,380
maybe I'm just not at the right counter, hold on a sec.

81
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:43,380
Okay, where are we, 955, Gattwick, oh number 31, okay, I'm not even close then.

82
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:51,380
Well hold on a sec, then let me just reconfigure my bag situation and you'll walk with me, right?

83
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Maybe we can check in together, that would be fun.

84
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Say one thing, I'm not gonna be.

85
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:06,380
Maybe one more sensible word come out of my mouth, that's for sure.

86
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Okay, and that's strange, nothing to say.

87
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:24,380
Okay, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put on my, my headphones for my phone, you know, this is the phone scam trick, right?

88
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:36,380
If you're new to sound seeing tours, you probably feel a bit conscious, as you walk around talking to yourself and the trick is to have a cell phone either up to your ear,

89
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:43,380
which I don't like, I don't want to do now because I already have a headache and holding my arm up makes aggravates if this really sucks.

90
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,380
There we go.

91
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:53,380
Now we're walking, I gotta go to number 31, this is number 21, I was 10 or so, maybe I can already check it and I'll be fun.

92
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,380
I'm doing easy jet checking experience.

93
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:07,380
I can't take the equipment with a love mic on through customs and through security.

94
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,380
They'll totally bust me for that.

95
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Although I heard Catholic inside of do that, Father Roderick, and he was recording in the airport.

96
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:30,380
Where's that in Rome, I think, he was recording his podcast, Catholicinsider.com, and what is it, kind of, kind of, kind of anity, what are they called?

97
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,380
Those bad looking dudes, they busted him, but they let him go.

98
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:41,380
Here's probably wearing his priest, his priest uniform.

99
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,380
Oh dude, I'm not gonna believe this.

100
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,380
There's something that lines for easy jet that'll freaking me out.

101
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
I don't know.

102
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Oh my goodness.

103
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,380
What's going on?

104
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,380
Oh my God, there's a hundred people here.

105
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,380
Oh shit.

106
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,380
I could have probably checked in hours ago.

107
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Oh, let's see.

108
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Is this line all for easy jet?

109
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Oh, you're slaying me with this.

110
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,380
People must be going somewhere else.

111
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,380
I am not gonna stand in that line.

112
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
That's for sure.

113
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Let's see.

114
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,380
Is there a self-service check-in for easy jet?

115
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:39,380
Wouldn't that rock to have us in the check?

116
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,380
Martin there and jet to come.

117
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,380
No easy jet check-in?

118
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
Why not?

119
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,380
I don't know.

120
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,380
Well that's no good.

121
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,380
No kidding.

122
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
Is that because they're cheap?

123
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,380
They don't want to buy a spot on your self-service checking?

124
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,380
No, because these are the same company.

125
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,380
But I think in the near future they're going to use the easy.

126
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,380
No hope so, because they haven't in London, they have the check-in that way.

127
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,380
So, there are no decides.

128
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,380
And if we put some pure milk here, I'll see.

129
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,380
Yeah, we have enough machines, but where are these people going?

130
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,380
Are they going to get away?

131
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,380
No, they're going to Manchester, Switzerland, and Woodley.

132
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,380
Okay, so I'll let them, I'll just wait because I'm a 10 o'clock flight.

133
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,380
No, I'm going to my flight, so I'm still 10.

134
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
And she, I could.

135
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,380
You want to come stand with me?

136
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Hang out with me?

137
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Yeah, people can figure this out.

138
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
Thank you.

139
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,380
Bye bye.

140
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,380
Holy moly.

141
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,380
No, not a good idea.

142
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,380
Oh man, this is me off.

143
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,380
So, then let's do this.

144
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
Let's buy some aspirin.

145
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,380
I'm definitely not going to wait through that.

146
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,380
I have to go downstairs.

147
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,380
Is there an escalator here?

148
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Is this only up?

149
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,380
This is only up?

150
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
Of course.

151
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,380
Well, I have to take the stairs down.

152
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:26,380
There's a group of muslim women, beautiful, beautifully colored scarves.

153
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,380
Beautiful colors.

154
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Okay.

155
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Oh man, do I need an aspirin bad?

156
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,380
It's like I keep taking, I'm even taking my glasses off while I'm walking.

157
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Because just...

158
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
It's the day that I wish I had my lenses in.

159
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,380
Yeah, a lot of that is just tension.

160
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,380
Tension from being so concentrated while flying.

161
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,380
This is the bottom section of Skippel Airport, which you've never been.

162
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Really is.

163
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Okay.

164
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
You know, I hope I'm not.

165
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,380
I hope I see where the microphone.

166
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,380
I hope this is recording not too much.

167
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,380
I'm going to just replace it just a little bit.

168
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Re-position, hold on.

169
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,380
A little bit.

170
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
There we go.

171
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,380
It should be fit better.

172
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,380
Sound like an old man, don't I?

173
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
Okay.

174
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,380
Just cleaning guys.

175
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,380
Just shooting the breeze.

176
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
I'll walk by.

177
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,380
I'm not working.

178
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,380
I'll walk by.

179
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,380
You can shut up.

180
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,380
Okay.

181
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Drunk store.

182
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,380
Just Kippel Airport really is beautiful.

183
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,380
It's got fantastic shopping from an odd.

184
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Which is accessible to anyone.

185
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,380
I don't have to be checked in through the gates.

186
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
I'm not excited, even better.

187
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,380
They've got a casino in there.

188
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
It's just beautiful.

189
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,380
We're passing here.

190
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,380
A spree, max, in where.

191
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,380
Matinik, Gassan, diamonds.

192
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:28,380
Drunk store.

193
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,380
There's the Tyrak.

194
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,380
Isn't that just a Tyrak everywhere in the world?

195
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,380
Conveniently located next to Burger King.

196
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,380
Temperature here is great though.

197
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
Nice and cool.

198
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:52,380
They're conditioning.

199
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,380
The two of them shop.

200
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
Interesting.

201
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,380
They're advertising for the Reichs Museum.

202
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
11 minutes.

203
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
The world famous old masters.

204
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,380
A little map of how to get there.

205
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,380
11 minutes by train from the airport.

206
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Okay.

207
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,380
There's lots of perfumes and colors now.

208
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
Maybe perfumes and colors?

209
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
No.

210
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
They don't have any aspirin.

211
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
Really.

212
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
Really got to get to the drugstore.

213
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,380
I know where it is.

214
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,380
And of course it's all the way at the other side.

215
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,380
With a food village supermarket here.

216
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:48,380
Italian trittura.

217
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,380
New electronic store.

218
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
I haven't seen before.

219
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,380
Photo electronics.

220
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,380
Walking past the guest store.

221
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,380
McGregor.

222
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,380
You can hear all the brands that are all represented.

223
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Jaguar.

224
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
Jaguar doing here.

225
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Jaguar bags and clothing.

226
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
Okay.

227
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
God.

228
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,380
It's exploding.

229
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,380
Juice bar.

230
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:23,380
This has got to be the most boring sound seeing tour I've ever done.

231
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,380
I just barely have any energy to talk.

232
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
Passure typical.

233
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,380
Valice.

234
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,380
In suitcase.

235
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,380
Store.

236
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Cheese.

237
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Louise.

238
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,380
Where is this place?

239
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,380
It's even further.

240
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Well certainly a way to kill time.

241
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,380
And I'm glad I'm walking because my back is also starting to act up a little bit.

242
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,380
Due to the flying.

243
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:03,380
You can hear those high heels that usually fly to 10.

244
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Everyone else is on soft.

245
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,380
Soft shoes.

246
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,380
There it is.

247
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,380
It's the atos.

248
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:29,380
Here we go.

249
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,380
I need some major major aspirin.

250
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
Okay.

251
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,380
Follow along now as we enter the store.

252
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:56,380
Hi.

253
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,380
Murofen.

254
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,380
Tipee 400.

255
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
Yeah.

256
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,380
400.

257
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Tipee 400.

258
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,380
Tipee 400.

259
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,380
Tipee 400.

260
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
Tipee 400.

261
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,380
Yeah.

262
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,380
Yeah.

263
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,380
Tipee 400.

264
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,380
Tipee 400.

265
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,380
Four.

266
00:24:40,380 --> 00:25:04,380
All right, do not pass, go, do not collect any money, sit down on the nearest couch.

267
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Crack these suckers over.

268
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,380
My goodness, that headache just really hit me.

269
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Okay.

270
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,380
All right.

271
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:35,380
Now, of course, I want to meet the results.

272
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,380
If it all possible.

273
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,380
Let's go upstairs and we'll walk back on the upper level.

274
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:54,380
See if we run into anything fun and then we'll close it off and just call today a loss.

275
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:13,380
Welcome past the hello there bar.

276
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,380
It's kind of where all the cab drivers hang out and wait for their rides to show up.

277
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,380
It's a ride also going from the rivals up to the departure level.

278
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,380
Back up and we'll start at number one and walk down to 31.

279
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,380
It's pretty good airport.

280
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,380
The only thing they messed up is the baggage system and they know it.

281
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,380
They really messed that one up.

282
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,380
It's been really bad ever since they bought in the automated system.

283
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:53,380
It's kind of like a Denver where that happened, where they had the big automatic baggage system.

284
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,380
Yeah, that's what it was.

285
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,380
The stuff got mangled, never showed up, never got out.

286
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,380
So these, it's pretty empty over here.

287
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Fin air.

288
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,380
Pretty sure it was BMI.

289
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,380
Lift on.

290
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Alan's got a quick check in, but these a jet doesn't.

291
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,380
That's disappointing to say the least.

292
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:30,380
Because the lines were just, well, it moves pretty quick with the easy jet.

293
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:36,380
Yeah, we've gone through that, but since there's no designated seating and checking,

294
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,380
it's just boom, boom, boom, boom.

295
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:43,380
It's still, I had a lot of people waiting there.

296
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,380
Now in the blue zone, which of course is all KLM checking.

297
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Really interesting.

298
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,380
They've got wow.

299
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,380
baggage drop off exclusively for business class passengers.

300
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,380
Avit and Avit plus members.

301
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,380
And there must be, wow, there must be a hundred terminals here.

302
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,380
All sitting there unused.

303
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,380
It smells like weed here.

304
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,380
It's gone.

305
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:23,380
So I'm basically walking from building one all the way to building three big sign here.

306
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,380
There's an Amro, runs SAP.

307
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,380
Wow, it makes me want to go out and buy an install right away.

308
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,380
There's a, there he talks to us.

309
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,380
I'm sorry, flight attendant.

310
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,380
Oh, wow.

311
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,380
There's two firemen here walking in full firemen year.

312
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
It's interesting.

313
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,380
With the oxygen tanks and they're going into the bathroom.

314
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,380
OK, well, that's not used that one, shall we?

315
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,380
That's probably a bad sign.

316
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
Interesting.

317
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,380
There's a premium servicing point here.

318
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,380
I don't know if premium is something that I don't know if that's used in other airports at all.

319
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:19,380
It's kind of a fast track to get through customs with a retinal scan.

320
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,380
And so you arrive at customs, you put your card in, little gate opens up.

321
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,380
And then you have to put your face in front of this scanner's leader around.

322
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,380
And a blue glowing hole.

323
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:41,380
And it's, I've really seen it fail more than I've seen at work because, you know,

324
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,380
when people come in from a longer flight, they got retized and attired.

325
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,380
And then it fails.

326
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,380
But of course, then you're still at the head of the line.

327
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:56,380
You get to cut right in, to go, you know, to talk to a customs agent.

328
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
They're pretty easy, by the way, anyway.

329
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,380
Anyone can really cut, you know, your paperwork's got to be pretty fucked up,

330
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,380
not to be able to enter the Netherlands.

331
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
I'll tell you that.

332
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,380
It's, it's really quite outrageous.

333
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,380
It's, look at you.

334
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,380
OK.

335
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,380
Don't even ask what you're doing.

336
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
Hi there.

337
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,380
That works seem to be OK.

338
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,380
Come on in.

339
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
Welcome.

340
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
Yeah.

341
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,380
No mind if you're going to work here or not.

342
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,380
We'll cause trouble.

343
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
OK.

344
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
We're back at.

345
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,380
Excuse me.

346
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
Number 20.

347
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
That's where I started before.

348
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,380
So we'll walk up to the easy jet counter.

349
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,380
See how the queue is.

350
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,380
See if that's gotten any better.

351
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,380
Otherwise, I might, if there's a little bit of a queue all stand in it,

352
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
we'll listen in the conversation.

353
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,380
If any, but of course, I'll be kind of hard to talk.

354
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:54,380
We'll pass senseless.

355
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,380
24.

356
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
Doubt that's cleared up that quick.

357
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,380
But yeah, we're now.

358
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,380
So empty.

359
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
Oh, wait.

360
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,380
It's a big line of de-gate.

361
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:17,380
But the customers and maybe always send a lot of people through.

362
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
But it's all those other flights.

363
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,380
So I've never had a large weight for this flight to get like now.

364
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
It's still big.

365
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,380
I've already seen it in a distance.

366
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,380
OK.

367
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,380
And I suggest we wrap it up for today.

368
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,380
I'm beat.

369
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,380
I'm amazed if you listen in this long anyway, really.

370
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,380
What I'll do is I'll check in.

371
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,380
Once I'm through, I'll slap together the ID3 tags.

372
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,380
And I'll upload this puppy.

373
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,380
Get it rolling.

374
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,380
Let me just check now.

375
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,380
It's still way dizzy.

376
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:08,380
Lots of different languages happen in here.

377
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
No.

378
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,380
Actually, it's a little bit better.

379
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,380
But it's still pretty, pretty full.

380
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,380
OK.

381
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,380
Then let me find a place to sit and disconnect from you.

382
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,380
OK.

383
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,380
OK.

384
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
That's it then.

385
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:36,380
Again, I apologize for the lack of a show.

386
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,380
And I'll tell you right up front, we're going to have some very different shows coming up

387
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,380
as of next week.

388
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,380
Because we're going on vacation.

389
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,380
And we're going to Miami.

390
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,380
There's a big music festival going on.

391
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,380
It's spring break.

392
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,380
Really looking forward to 10 days just hanging out.

393
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Me and the girls.

394
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
And I'll be doing my podcast.

395
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
But it will be different types of podcasts.

396
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,380
So some of it will be some of the produce stuff.

397
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,380
I'm sure we'll do some sound seeing stuff.

398
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
We'll figure it out.

399
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,380
We're going to have some fun.

400
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,380
OK.

401
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,380
All right, everybody.

402
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,380
Thanks for checking it out.

403
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,380
The show for today is the 23rd of March 2005.

404
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,380
This was your daily source code.

405
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,380
Thanks again.

406
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
And talk to you real soon.

407
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,380
That'd be in tomorrow.

408
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Bye.
