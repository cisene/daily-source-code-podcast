1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The Lays there began as you reach web to tackle.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There were chances this hit shut out of your Texas Ranger's final score last night at 9B.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First on 635 OVJ.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's Adam Curry and it is your daily source code.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And when I say that I'm meeting my friend, my family, my lovers, my world leaders, this is your daily source code.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Coming to you from South Beach, Florida, from my bed.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
On the top of the bed, that is from the hotel room.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's the source code for Wednesday, January 5, 2005.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, I got a one year front. I'm completely unprepared.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, I got some show notes, the typical stuff that I basically collected an outline as I prepare for the show.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But I haven't really done any shifting around or positioning or really haven't formatted it.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I just want to fly a little bit by the seat of my pants because quite honestly, I'm tired.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And it's good because the tiredness comes from all things good.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
My body said, yeah, we can do a podcast. My brain said, hmm.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Look at what you want to do, body.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, it's like a couple of hours.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I just want to wrap a little bit, give you a little update where we're at right now.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Today, as I said, as Wednesday is January 5, 2005, it's about quarter to three in the afternoon.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And got back about 45 minutes ago from breakfast, slash lunch.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And now it wasn't brunch because Dave and I actually intended to get some breakfast, but could not get served at the big pink sucked.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Actually, I got into like a something I never do.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I got angry, I got irritated that we just couldn't get any service.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't know, I think with the position the table was bad, but then there was like no apology.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's just, you know, fuck you.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's kind of, I guess that sometimes that is a little bit of the attitude, certainly in the extremely hip South Beach quadrant.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But we're having a good time and really good time.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We had a, what I consider, I think, break through day yesterday between Ron, Dave and I.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We really got to a point where we said, okay, yeah, now we've got, you know, now the shit's starting to click.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's falling into place.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We, you know, this is exactly what we were, we're hoping for what we were expecting.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And, and so that was last night until 11, then I got back.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And really, I intended to go to bed, but I couldn't stop listening to yeast radio.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And I'm glad I did because 33 minutes into the show that, um, aired the day before yesterday.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mad started talking about Dave.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And, um, if you haven't heard it, let me share that with you right now because, um, this magic is a smart cookie boy.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I tell you, I have to blow my nose and I have the lava layer on.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So cover your ears.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've got, now I sound like Dave wine and sneezing all over the, driving the car.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I love his podcast, by the way.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think it's, it's absolutely one of my favorites.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Because it's just, you know, very down in the car.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The way he sort of has this hippie accent and the smell.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And those kinds of, kind of, but let's face the guys, you know, he's, he's got an amazing mind.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And it's sort of like what I was talking about was Nicole Kidman.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And, oh, that's a horrible comparison.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But, no, wait a minute.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I think that's a beautiful comparison.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Dave Winner.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Nicole Kidman.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Dave Winner.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Nicole Kidman.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You know, it's like Nicole Kidman is so beautiful.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It doesn't matter what she does.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It doesn't matter.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Because she's beautiful.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She can be a Kant.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't care.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Because she's beautiful.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And she's got a little bit of talent.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But you see, Dave, why?

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She got a little bit of talent.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She got a humongous amount of Botox and that forehead match.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come on, be honest there.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hmm.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I wouldn't exactly say he's beautiful, but you see, he's got a good brain.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And that entitles him to be kind of, you know, nuts.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And a little bit of a mess or whatever.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I don't know the guy, so I'm judging him.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And I'm just making examples.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But I'm just talking about what I've, you know,

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
from what I'm guessing based on his personality.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I guess I'm guessing that he tends to be a little overbearing.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I certainly can relate to this sort of thing.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have relatives that are overbearing.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm certainly not.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've always tried not to be overbearing in my life.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because I don't want to repeat the mistakes.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My mother made it.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So you know, I get the impression that he's a little difficult to deal with.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He seems to rub people the wrong way at times.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It sounds like this RSS business was a bit difficult for him,

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
because a bunch of people basically.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know, but see, this is all.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is what I'm hearing basically from Dave's own podcast.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And from, you know, that's just the impression I get.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And since I am a lesbian, I'm a little psychic.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So I'm reading this.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's sort of a reading that I'm giving him for free.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If he's listening, which he probably isn't.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, but match.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's why you're wrong.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because of course we're listening to you.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Of course we are.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And well, maybe he isn't.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Because now that I think of it,

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've never seen Dave and Madge together in the same picture.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't know.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But anyway.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't forget what I was talking about.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So then Madge, unfortunately, did forget to continue the comparison

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
between Nicole Kidman and Dave Winner and to continue with the psychic reading.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was totally into the psychic reading.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So anyway, I heard this.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It was like 130.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I was laughing out loud throughout the whole podcast.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It wasn't just a David.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It was fabulous.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's almost like Joan Rivers, Howard Stern, and Rush Limbaugh,

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
not his politics per se, but they had a love child.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And out, you know, pop, Madge.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I sent Madge an email.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I said, Madge, you know, I worship you.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You are so awesome.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The stuff you say and how you present it,

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
it does it for me.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And the only place that a podcast like East Radio

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
would work is in a podcast.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It doesn't work on radio.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The way she talks, what she says,

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
how she presents it, the language,

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
which is, you know,

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
it would never make it past anything.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It couldn't even make it up to

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Michael Powell's front door.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's the chairman of the FCC, by the way.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So I was just totally digging it and I said,

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
you know, would you please make an appearance on a daily source code?

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Could it call you up?

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So I was hoping to be able to do it today,

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but it's not going to work.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So just a timing issue.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to call Madge later tonight.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We'll record it and of course we'll use that on the source code for tomorrow.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So you can look forward to that.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm certainly looking forward to talking to Madge.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think it's going to be quite a hoot.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So anyway, this morning at 9 o'clock,

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Fox television showed up.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This was pre-arranged,

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
pre-read, Fox television in Chicago.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Although it wasn't the Chicago folks,

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I had spoken to the producer Nina over there at Great Length,

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and previously before I even left for the trip,

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
because they wanted to interview me.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, you know, it's like shoot.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm here in the States, mine as well,

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but I'm not going to come to Chicago.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's no problem, because what they do then is they send their affiliate,

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
their local Fox affiliate, which is,

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I forget what the call sign is here.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And they said over a really nice young lady, producer,

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and she had all the questions.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I could tell that this was well prepared,

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and they did a good job of really lighting the room.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Of course, you know, they want me to, you know,

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
after you do all the questions,

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
then they need what they call B-roll.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The term B-roll.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah, I guess B-roll comes from the term,

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
well, if you look at, you have the A-roll and the B-roll.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So the role, of course, used to be the film role,

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and A is pretty much the interview role,

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and B-roll is like all the stuff,

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
you know, of me walking on the street,

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
of me sitting in front of my computer,

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
typing on the keypad, you know,

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the shit that you've done a million times

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
when people want to put together a nice little package.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's really the only reason for the B-roll

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
is to cover up the edits that they do in the interview.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So of course, they're not going to air the hour and a half

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
that we spoke about all these different things

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
about podcasting and about enclosures

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and users and developers partying together

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
in the daily source code and morning coffee notes,

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and all this.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So they're going to take a little snippet side of it

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
because, yeah, who knows how much, you know,

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
can be made out of the item or how much time

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
they'll get, maybe, a couple minutes tops.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And so is to not see me, you know,

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
jumping all over the camera because you're cutting

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
right in the middle of my, of what I was saying,

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
or my answers, that's when they paste a bit.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It'd be roll over it.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So you basically hear my voice,

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
continue underneath the B-roll.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now in this particular B-roll,

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
they need a little bit more than just me

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
working on the computer.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Every single television program,

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
including the BBC,

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
always wants to video me doing a podcast.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Personally, I'm not a big fan of this.

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I really don't like it.

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And why?

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Because I believe in theater of the mind.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Theater of the mind is,

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
if you're good at it,

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you can kick ass on radio.

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In fact, we used to have theater on radio,

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and it was a bunch of guys stay.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll never forget my dad.

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
One of the things I remember that my dad told me

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
is that he will never forget the day

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
that he went, he was taken by,

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I guess his dad,

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to a radio studio to see how they did the old-time drama.

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think I don't know if it was loan-ranger

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
or, but he was going to be in the studio audience.

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And it was so disappointing.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He said, you know, had this entire vision

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
of how the actors looked and, you know,

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and the sound effects.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And, but really, he was pretty much imagining a movie

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
in his head, which was the theater of the mind.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You know, they created this reality

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
of what the show should look like.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Very much like when you read a book.

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You know, you have a movie that plays in your head

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and you see the pictures,

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and you can kind of envision that,

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
which is the beauty of using your mind,

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
which, by the way,

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
doesn't happen when you're watching television.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're polluting your mind,

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and I know, because I come from television,

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and I used to be a big,

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
a big polluter, major league pollution dude.

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And, so, of course,

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
they wanted to see me podcasting.

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't want to, you know, it's like right now.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I say, I'm laying in my bed in my hotel room,

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and you have a vision of that.

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know, and maybe you think in this big rest,

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
waterbed, and have a friendship,

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
named Jerome.

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So maybe you think that,

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
or maybe you think a fuzzy bed,

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
or maybe you're thinking,

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
like, one of those honeymoon porn sweets,

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
or who knows what you're thinking?

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You know, that's your thoughts,

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and you have an idea of how I'm sitting or laying down,

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
or what I'm wearing,

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and I want that to be,

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
you know, that's the magic stuff,

248
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
that is a big part of the magic of radio.

249
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Who was it, the other?

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It was an article,

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and I forget who wrote it,

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
who said, you know,

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't really don't want to see Adam set up,

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
because I have the idea of him sitting there with the headphones,

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and a big fuzzy microphone in front of him,

256
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and kind of like a dimly lit room with the,

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
you know, smoke, whisping up from the astray.

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You get the, like the Dr. Johnny fever vibe from WKRP,

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and Cincinnati.

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And so the minute kind of show that,

261
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
a lot of it goes away,

262
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and then also basically I have to fake doing a podcast,

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
because they needed the audio,

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
so I was wearing my headphones,

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
but they weren't really plugged in,

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
because you were hearing the audio coming through the speakers,

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and yeah, so it's not entirely,

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
you know, the stuff I like to do,

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but I think with a little bit of luck,

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
we will get the Sylvia Speedy's played on this,

271
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
because I talked about him in the interview,

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and I played him in my faux podcast.

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I want to be famous,

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I want to wear minks and sattens and pearls.

275
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I want to be famous,

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
more than just any old girl.

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I want to have eyes as blue as the sea.

278
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I want all the people to look at me.

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I want my own show on TV.

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I want to be that girl.

281
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I want to be famous.

282
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You got it's art, it's not part of you that's spy.

283
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I want to be famous.

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Got a pair of some private flights.

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I want to have lovers buy the score.

286
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
When we produce this knocking down on my door,

287
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
this is the faith that is in store for me.

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, when I'm famous,

289
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I will wear a great trench coat and fake red hair.

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So they all will know that it is me.

291
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
When they see me,

292
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
how they'll smile,

293
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and me photo grass to sign.

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I will say sorry babe.

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Talk to my assistant.

296
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I want to be famous.

297
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Stabloids will print what I eat.

298
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I want to be famous

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
who I do will be news on the street.

300
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then when I'm old,

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll have a ball.

302
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
There'll be shops that I'm living at all.

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
When I enter the guests will fall

304
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
to their knees.

305
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then I step the thrones

306
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
on my enemies' bed.

307
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
All I don't want one in cheese

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
when I'm famous.

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Spameless.

310
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Spameless.

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So exhausting.

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Spameless.

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Spameless.

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Spameless.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Spameless.

316
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Spameless.

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Spameless.

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Spameless.

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Spameless.

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Spameless.

321
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Spameless.

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Spameless.

323
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Spameless.

324
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Spameless.

325
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Spameless.

326
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Spameless.

327
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Spameless.

328
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Spameless.

329
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Spameless.

330
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Spameless.

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Spameless.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Spameless.

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Spameless.

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Spameless.

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Spameless.

336
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Spameless.

337
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Spameless.

338
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And then I step the thrones

339
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
on my enemies' bed.

340
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Spameless.

341
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Spameless.

342
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Spameless.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Spameless.

344
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Into a whirl whirl whirl

345
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Every morning I don't get high on

346
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Colored hills, Margines dry

347
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
A little wee and just a touch

348
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I wanna be my famous better than all of my fellow much better than all of her

349
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,500
I wanna be famous, lonely and alone at the end

350
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll hand up bitter and ugly and old

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Not just my body, but also my soul

352
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,000
But a legend is my goal and a legend of being

353
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,500
When I'm famous, not I will give for the little people

354
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,000
All their teams, when I'm famous

355
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm famous, I'm famous

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So we're freshing to hear the Bitties once again

357
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Check them out at Bittiesforever.com

358
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's B-I-D-D-I-E-S for number forever.com

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I'm talking to their production manager

360
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
On email, who by the way is also a pilot

361
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And he's been recording all kinds of live shows

362
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And he says, standby, I'm gonna bring it to you

363
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm very excited about some of the CBS Bitties live music

364
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And just excited about them getting famous

365
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You know they will, you know they will

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's so good.

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Talk about music for a second

368
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That seems to be a topic that we've been hitting here in Miami a couple of times

369
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I've been talking about

370
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Now you have to understand that Ron has had quite a

371
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Quite a career as a producer and a writer

372
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
A little bit as a performer, certainly as a musician

373
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, by the way

374
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't tell anyone

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Ron actually lived with Princess Stephanie of Monaco for about two or three years

376
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay, don't tell anyone I told you that

377
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He actually produced that horrible record she did

378
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I have to say it wasn't a horrible record

379
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It was a poppy record, that's for sure

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I remember because I met Princess Stephanie of Monaco

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
When she was like she's like my age

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And I was 19 or 20 just starting

383
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Television, music television in Holland

384
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
At Veronica doing the show Countdown

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
She came to promote a record

386
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I did connect with her, she was really nice

387
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Very sweet, you know she spoke very limited English and my French will

388
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Now, as Madge would say

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah, French, that's what kind

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Right, Madge

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Um

392
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But yeah, so anyway that was the long long long ago connection that I had with Ron

393
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But Ron has done some, he done some good stuff

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And he's working a lot of different people in the music industry

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He's a great musician, he plays guitar and plays piano

396
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He actually, the piece here, the the The La Civius bitties

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let me see if I can pick that piece up here this little

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Intro Ludes

399
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
All of my thoughts

400
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah, this bit

401
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, this bit, this is the piano

402
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is pretty wrong, can play like this

403
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I was imagine Ron playing this before he got married

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I gave him

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
Don't you come over here to go for your friends when I play a little bit of fun?

406
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Yeah, I will.

407
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,280
But I think we really see, and it's great, because Ron has such a take on how the music industry works.

408
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,640
You know, he actually gets paid from ASCAP via my. That's where he does get money.

409
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,000
In fact, after every Christmas holiday season, after the air supply records, the Christmas

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
album has been out, you know, Ron received a check. So that system is working for him.

411
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,040
And he approaches it as a musician who's getting paid that way and where the system is working for him.

412
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,680
And we've really gotten deep into this. And we're all very excited about the possibilities.

413
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,920
Did I see Dave post something that he wrote in 2000? Yeah, 2000, I think. Let me just see.

414
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,640
How was it? It was a quote he put on the scripting today.

415
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,880
Um, I'm going to be fine at for you.

416
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,000
Uh, okay, yeah, this was April, April 7th. Was that July 7th?

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh, dates are such a hard thing to do, man. When it comes to seven. No, that would be

418
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,280
January, March, June, July, okay, July 4th, July 4th.

419
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,960
With that, we'll come new music, a new ways to play it, new ways to explore the emotions it brings up,

420
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,600
and new kinds of community, deep ones, far deeper than those who've been able to create

421
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,720
on the silent web. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the silent web is no longer silent.

422
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
We've gone from silent to talkies. And I think we could be in the space for a little while. We don't

423
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,600
necessarily have to go to video just in just yet. Nor can we. Sure, on a personal basis, you know,

424
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,520
if I wanted a couple people to subscribe to a private podcast feed where I put a, you know, a

425
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,360
500 or 600 megabyte file for for you to enjoy. And I'm not talking about a movie that I'd rip off,

426
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,960
but just maybe something I created, right, or a Mad Weinstein as all kinds of videos.

427
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,440
Problem is, um, that's just too much bandwidth. We don't have the hard drives. We don't have the pipes,

428
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,720
uh, not if you're going to go over like those five people. If you're going to go over, if you

429
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
want to have 50,000 people grabbing it, it's not going to work. Not yet. You know, that's, uh,

430
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,320
that's a very important part of what we're doing here. Yeah, sure. This solution is all kinds of stuff.

431
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,000
We've been talking about that, too. You know, I think Bitcoin will play a role in that. So anyway,

432
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,880
regardless of all that, um, it's just been interesting to, to work through all the different issues.

433
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,560
And, you know, I want to work with these people. I want to work with the biddies. I want to,

434
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:33,520
I really do want to make them famous. I seriously do. And, um, God, we have such a unique combination

435
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,440
of people in this, uh, in this community. And it's going to be great. That's all I can say. God,

436
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,120
dammit. It's just going to be great. See, a man just rubbing off on me. I'm starting to get rank and,

437
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:50,640
and, and talk crappy and shit. But anyway, I got a, um, an email from Susie, uh, Susie Puggsley

438
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,920
says, uh, I put together this podcast called Hotline. And, uh, of course, in the show notes,

439
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:07,280
you couldn't, uh, actually have the, the podcast feed right there. And I caught the show before

440
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,880
or she sent me the email, actually. I'm going to just play a little bit for you. Because I think that

441
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,920
this is a podcast that, uh, would probably be very interesting to listen to. And, uh, it's the

442
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,880
type of podcast that needs a little push, um, because, um, well, you can't really have an, you know,

443
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,920
an interaction if you don't have people to interact with. So check out Susie's idea for her podcast.

444
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:34,800
Hello and welcome to my first official podcast. My name's Susie. S.U. Z. Y. And now what I'm going to do,

445
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,400
I'm basically your, one of the mill average human being, but I just happen to be good

446
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,160
giving advice and helping people out. And it's what I like to do. Um, so basically what I'm

447
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:52,560
going to do on a weekly basis, I am going to try and help those people who may not have anybody else

448
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,320
to talk to or, you know, just going to problem that they don't, you know, the thing embarrassed

449
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,200
about talking about. And I'm, you know, completely open minded. You can't really shock me,

450
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,360
or, although I'm always up for a challenge. So feel free to try and shock me on that one. I'm sure

451
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,280
it'll give everyone out there all that. Um, so what really I'd like you to do with, if there's

452
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,920
anyone out there who would like to talk or if they've got a certain problem or anything that they're

453
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,720
fascinated about and want to just go. So, you know, just end all, anything general, you know,

454
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,320
topics or problems just give them any mail. And, uh, I'll talk about it or, you know, problems, I'll

455
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,440
help you out and I'll give you some advice of what I think best. And instead, I'm not a doctor.

456
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,040
I'm not qualified in any way whatsoever. But I'm a good human being and I'm honest. I'm always

457
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,920
honest, you know, however hard the situation may be and however, you know, complicated the problem might

458
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:53,760
be. I will give you my, you know, my utmost best to try and help you out. Uh, so my email address

459
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:05,120
is Suzy at SuzyP.co.uk. Um, feel free to email me with anything, however small or however big.

460
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,560
And I'll talk you through it and mention it next time I do a podcast. I'm going to try and do it

461
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,800
on a weekly basis. So, once a week, once I get all the emails back through. And we'll just see where

462
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,040
we go from there because obviously I'm, you know, I'm free and easy. I quite like helping people.

463
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,960
So it seemed a logical step. So there you go. So my name's Suzy. And if you've got anything you'd

464
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,120
like to talk about, then please feel free to email me. Take care and I hope to have your response.

465
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,840
Okay. Thank you, Suzy. I'm pretty sure that Suzy is going to get some comments and it's kind of like

466
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,240
the idea of a podcasting, right? You're Suzy. I'm pretty glad we did this. Uh, it's kind of like off

467
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,400
the cuff kind of like un-unprepared type show for today because it's, uh, it's even more creative

468
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,680
than it usually is for me. Rick Resowitz, who does the ICM RAW podcast, um, and, um, as you remember,

469
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,040
I played Rick Deringer, played a couple songs, uh, including Hang On Slupee, which started

470
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:11,120
an entire slupee cover, you know, Mania in podcast space. Oh my god, I said space in podcast

471
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,880
lamb. He sent me a press release with some excellent news. He says that, uh, watch of this press release

472
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,640
came from, uh, Rick Deringer. Uh, he and Rick has the, uh, a request which has the connection with

473
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,080
Rick Deringer. He recorded those live tracks February 5, 2005, Rick Deringer in conjunction with

474
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,800
the John and Twistle Foundation, John and Twistle from the who will present the musicians for

475
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,160
hurricane relief benefit concert. I'm just reading from the, uh, from the, uh, the press release here.

476
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,000
Superstar guitars, Rick Deringer will not only perform at the concert, but as executive music

477
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,920
director, he's been the driving force behind the event, gathering many of his famous friends

478
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,360
joined this very worthy cause. All proceeds from the concert and CD DVD of the event will go to

479
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,840
Florida hurricane relief in the American Red Cross. The event will be held at Universal theme park in

480
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:03,040
Orlando, Florida. God, wrong month to be here. Um, and, uh, what I understand is that Rick will, uh,

481
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,440
Rick, our Rick, not well, Rick Deringer is also our Rick now. We've been deared him. He's, he's totally

482
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,400
our Rick. Rick Wesowitz is, uh, I think he's going to record this live and, uh, as far, what I understood

483
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,840
from his accompanying email, it will be, um, pod safe. So we'll be able to play anything we want.

484
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,640
And of course, we're going to work on the honor system, uh, and, uh, you know, we're going to

485
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,680
expect that if, you know, if you're listening to that particular podcast that you are, or have donated to, uh,

486
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,080
to the, um, hurricane relief. Why does it say hurricane relief? Right. Okay, a Florida of course,

487
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,920
hurricane. They've donated to the hurricane relief. Now look at this lineup. This is going to blow you away.

488
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,840
Actually, let's play a little game here. Let's play a little game of what does Adam have in his iTunes.

489
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,640
And I certain this is, by the way, is not my entire library. Um, Erasmith's Steven Tyler's going to be there.

490
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:03,520
Um, hold on. Why did my iTunes start up? What's going on here? Uh, I say, I don't want to

491
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,480
read the, okay, here we go. Because in iTunes, like you can just basically just search and let's see if

492
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,560
anything pops up. Let's see if I had the song. So we can do a little promo here.

493
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,480
God, this is like, fun. Okay. Uh, erasmith's Steven Tyler. Do we have anything by Erasmith?

494
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,440
Yes, I believe we do. Let's see if we have my erasmith. Oops.

495
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,120
Right, sweet emotion. I have another one by erasmith. I got this one.

Banjovies, Richie Sambora. God, do I have Banjovies and, uh, probably do.

498
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,280

499
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,240

Okay, we got some Banjovies. AC DCs, Brian Johnson.

Man, this is a great frickin' lineup. Okay, let's see if I got some AC DC. AC DC.

502
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,720
Ooh, how come we don't have AC DC? Oh, please. Please, don't tell me I don't have AC DC because

503
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,440
of course I got some frickin' AC DC.

504
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,240
Banjovies, Banjovies, Banjovies, Banjovies, Banjovies, Banjovies, Banjovies, Banjovies, Banjovies,

505
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
One, two.

506
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Okay, uh, else we have almond brothers. Dude, do you think Adam Curry has almond brothers?

507
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:45,040
Oh. Uh, nope. No almond brothers. Okay. Uh, three dog night.

508
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,760
Uh, who from three dog night's coming Chuck Negrin? Uh, okay. So do we have any three dog night?

509
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,080
Three dog dog. Well, of course we got some three dog night.

510
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,960
This is like the show that's totally gonna be for me. It's gonna be such an awesome show to see.

511
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Let's move it along here. Grand Funk Railroad. Okay, there's anyone who knows a great Grand Funk Railroad

512
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,160
tournament. Well, of course you do. It's some kind of wonderful, oh man, these sounds.

513
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,760
I wish I could play them all for you. I don't need a whole lot of money.

514
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:34,480
You know how, um, you know how, um, you know how you can mess up the lyrics and you think that

515
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,200
for years sometimes that they're singing one thing and and and you're basically singing another

516
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,640
thing. Let's just see how I do with the rest of the lyrics here.

517
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,960
What have we missed here? Chief trick. Uh, of course we've got my favorite team, Chief Trick

518
00:28:50,960 --> 00:29:03,280
track here. I want you to want me. Okay, uh, Michael Bolton also on the ticket. My

519
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:10,400
old neighbor, Michael Bolton. He lived next to me, uh, at the apartment on the 56th and Broadway

520
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,640
and when we lived in the symphony house. He was a nice guy. Really nice guy. In fact, I got him

521
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,920
on MTV when he was so totally not frickin' hip to be on MTV. They all wanted him to be on VH1

522
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,760
and uh, after that he got it. He had the big hit with Doc of the Bay and that was kind of

523
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,800
then unfortunately. This is, uh, what was that? That's what loves all about.

524
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, wait. I have a different one, my Michael Bolton. What's that? This is Michael Bolton.

525
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,920
Nobody's home right now, but at the time, please leave a message and they'll get back to you.

526
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:48,720
I don't know why I have that. Oh, this is, this is possibly, I've done many appearances with,

527
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,520
with this guy. Uh, oh my god, I can't believe it. Don't tell me,

528
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,960
don't have Eddie money in my iTunes. Where's two tickets to Paradise?

529
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,920
Oh, this is horrible. Don't tell me, I don't have shit. Okay, no Eddie money.

530
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:11,360
Joan Jet, we shared the same manager, Kenny Laguna, Kenny Laguna, uh, used to be, uh, in, uh,

531
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,240
in the Shondales, I think. But Joan Jet's gonna be there. Of course, the classic Joan Jet,

532
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,480
I love rock and roll. Doing pretty good so far, only missed out one.

533
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,800
Um, what do we have? Pat Traverse. I don't think I have any

534
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,720
Pat Traverse. No, no Pat Traverse. Sticks. Yeah, of course. I got some sticks. Of course. Do

535
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,480
little, little, little, little. Yeah, that's my favorite song. It's like three minutes and two seconds.

536
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,720
It's the song you always played at the very end. It's like, babe, I'm leaving. Must be on my way.

537
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,360
My time is drawn in the air.

538
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,840
Just get the first line there, just to enjoy it there.

539
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Oh, here comes the due to the loop loop part.

540
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,160
By the way, as a podcast that does this, uh, the podcast is called as it was played to me.

541
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,520
And it's in the iPod.org directory, and it's essentially the guy does the same thing. I'm doing.

542
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,200
Just talks over the records and, you know, and sings one with lyrics.

543
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,080
Beautiful. Okay. Let me just see what are we doing on time here. Okay. Good. I do have a

544
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,120
couple more things I want to talk to about, but I'm almost through the list. I just

545
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,560
giving you an idea of how incredible this show is going to be on February 5th. Spencer Davis,

546
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,360
well, of course, I could play Steve Winwood and get away with it.

547
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,840
But that's always good to have the original of that give me some love and maybe

548
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,000
the Ham and Oregon man would be three, I guess. When I kick them, this is just

549
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,080
giving me goose bumps. Look at that.

550
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,000
Uh, so we had that. Oh, rig deranger. Okay. Now, I'm going to play something different from rig deranger.

551
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,040
Of course, we, we played two songs, including Hang on Slopey, but the one deranger song, of course,

552
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,440
that I grew up with was rock and roll, whoo cheek, whoo baby.

553
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,640
I asked him, I probably could play the whole thing, but we'll just leave it at this for now.

554
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,200
It also sounds like Randy MC.

555
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:34,000
Okay. Uh, Connie Wilson. So, Connie Wilson, we'd have to say Wilson Phillips, I guess, right?

556
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,440
Do we have any Wilson Phillips? Uh, yeah, of course. We got hold on. Yeah.

557
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,400
God, that thing was huge. That was a big hit.

558
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,160
So it was Kanye.

559
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,480
I got flock of seagulls, shoot. The only song I would have by flock of seagulls is I ran and I don't have that one.

560
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,120
Lauren Hill, uh, don't have Lauren Hill.

561
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,840
That's it. Plus, many more surprised guests to be out of between now and show time. Please join us

562
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,040
and making a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of Floridians who've been forever

563
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,560
changed by the record breaking tragedies of the summer of 2004. My sincerest thanks, Rick Deranger,

564
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,920
executive music director, musicians for Hurricane Relief, excellent. And of course,

565
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,600
I'm going to support you, Rick. You know we will. See, quick email that I got from Stuart Hunter.

566
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,080
We were talking about Tim Bird, the Birdman, everybody. Just the other day. I'm, uh, I'm a sure.

567
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,920
We're talking about real voices and, and, uh, well, oh, no, it's talking about VH1. That's right.

568
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:52,720
With Tim Bird was on VH1. And Stuart sent in, uh, little note and said, uh, Adam,

569
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,960
Tim Bird, the Birdman is a DJ on sunny 104.3 FM in Palm Beach County, Florida.

570
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,640
I tried, I couldn't receive it on the on the radio here in the hotel room, because I would have been great to

571
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,560
record a little bit. Hey, everybody's Tim Bird Birdman, I just want to go 4.3 FM right here in Palm Beach,

572
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:21,360
Florida. Rome, Rome, cadence of the day. Today's cadence comes on the USC Trojans to go along with a big

573
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
game in the Orange Bowl.

574
00:35:51,360 --> 00:36:21,360
I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I

575
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:42,420
I'm, uh, I'm, um, uh, oh I'm, uh, I'm, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, boy.

576
00:36:42,420 --> 00:37:12,420
I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it

577
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:42,420
I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to

578
00:37:42,420 --> 00:38:12,420
do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm

579
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:42,420
going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it,

580
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,420
what we need now is we need a drum cadence of the day, specialized podcast feed and

581
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:55,980
I've been in touch with Taylor who puts us together and has actually been putting his out

582
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:02,180
on overpodcast.org, which for Anna, you can subscribe to OpenPodcast.org and you'll get the

583
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,060
drum cadence of the day, but I wanted to have it zone feed and so I'm going to help them set

584
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,060
that up and work on that because it clearly has accents to the stuff, there is an audience,

585
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:17,240
I know that because everyone says the drum cadence is even day, and I thought the

586
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,180
Dave just loved it kind of for walking, but here's the story that Dave Wiener told me,

587
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:29,260
he said that he actually is pretty good at drumming because what happened was when he was

588
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,500
back in the day when I guess right after punch cards, when computers actually needed

589
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:41,380
to compile, he had to wait around for quite a while where the shit was compiling,

590
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:49,260
it's none of this like F5, and it's compiled business, none of those would take hours

591
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:55,300
or 10, 20, 30 minutes, I don't know, and to pass the time he would play the drums, and

592
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,620
he can say he got pretty good at it, and there's something about the cadence is that

593
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:05,740
people just totally dig. Also, I think it's a very American art form, it's probably

594
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:16,980
the closest thing culturally, it's probably very close to Africa, don't you think?

595
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,740
I mean, I've seen lots, I used to live in Uganda, I was very young, but I remember the rhythm

596
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:30,260
is kind of the same, digging it, digging it. Alrighty, so what's on the agenda for today?

597
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:37,180
I think we're going to see if Dave is a welcome from his Nat, then we're going to do some stuff

598
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:44,420
together, I think, well, maybe a little bit of, look, he's going to work on a podcast, I'm

599
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,460
going to work on some programming, that's what that's basically what our relationship is,

600
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:54,460
and it really works. That was the drone room cadence of the day.

601
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:15,460
That's right, and leaving you with this final thought, mad, I'm going to show it tomorrow.

602
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:24,460
Alright, thanks everybody for listening in, but what are we going to do? Just about right

603
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:30,460
for me, a little different today, a little different, not bad at all. Okay, oh by the way,

604
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:38,460
if you didn't see my weblog, the bandwidth has arrived at home. I could not be happier.

605
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,460
I'm going to try and get Christina to hook it up tomorrow and see if it actually works.

606
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,460
So, it looks like the easy net guys that are really good by me, then, of course, I expected that.

607
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,460
Hey, if you've got to comment, leave it for me on the weblog, www.curry.com,

608
00:41:53,460 --> 00:42:00,460
or adamantcurry.com tomorrow, as said, be busy, we've got some people flying in,

609
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:07,460
that we're going to be talking to here, but on the phone or on Skype, the one, the only badge

610
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:14,460
I'm staying from you is to radio on the daily source code. Talk to you tomorrow, y'all. Bye bye.
