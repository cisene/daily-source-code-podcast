1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Adam Curry, web pioneer of Gumpshite, you decide.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We don't need no sticky ingredients in it.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm guessing it's Adam Curry.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And it's the daily source code for July 8, 2005.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm living for a little bit.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I didn't expect to hang you so early in the program.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm just rebooted as well.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Everybody how you doing is the Friday edition of your daily source code.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage and Gilford, the United Kingdom.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Up 30-40 minutes of meaningless nonsense.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I do have a lot to talk about today.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In fact, I wrote down a list so I wouldn't get confused.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Also, I reached into the old firewire drive and pulled out an old pod save tune

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that I hadn't played in a while, but just listening to the stuff.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Have a piece of audio from when I was 16 years old.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
One of my first radio shows.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We talked about it so much on the show I figured.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I'll actually tell you where you can subscribe to a feed of my old radio shows,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
which is frightening at least.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So it is July 8, it is one day after the multiple terrorist attacks in London.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I am so incredibly impressed by the Brits.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Man, the word I guess everyone using is vigilance.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Very vigilance.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Which means they are aware, they are paying attention,

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but they are also getting about with their business.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just getting on and we will not be knocked down.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And just very wonderful to see.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll talk a little bit more about that on today's show.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Also, this is a mashup.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It is a little wacky.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And you have to kind of get used to it at first,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but I think it is 40 intros mixed into one.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It is by Osmiso.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It is called intros inspection.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
See if you can count all the intros and recognize every single one of them.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I love the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She must be great, you're great, you're great, you're great.

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
She must be great, you're great, you're great, you're great, you're great.

45
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:54,000
She must be great, you're great, you're great, you're great, you're great, you're great, you're great, you're great.

46
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:40,000
man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man, are you the boring one here Muronga is horror Governor about what happened in

49
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There's no one's afraid, I was bad enough to love you

50
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There's no one's afraid, I was bad enough to love you

51
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There's no one's afraid, I was bad enough to love you

52
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There's no one's afraid, I was bad enough to love you

53
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll feel you in every single day

54
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The pain is not right in the face

55
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The pain is not right in the face

56
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The pain is not right in the face

57
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The pain is not right in the face

58
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The pain is not right in the face

59
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The pain is not right in the face

60
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The pain is not right in the face

61
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The pain is not right in the face

62
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is the end.

63
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is the end.

64
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I've told you it was kind of wacky, kind of weird.

65
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I liked it though.

66
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,320
It was probably the only mashup I've ever played on the source code that actually fits into

67
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,000
some kind of fair use with the short little segments.

68
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Very cool.

69
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Very different.

70
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's for sure.

71
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And the rhythm kind of changed along the way, but it was nice.

72
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I actually reminded me of some of the work Patricia's done in the past.

73
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I should play one of those, one of her medlies.

74
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
She's done a lot of cool ones.

75
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

76
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
A little bit of complaining of first upfront.

77
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I really messed up my shoulder.

78
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And since I've been complaining to Patricia, I was complaining to you a little bit.

79
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's stupid, but somehow I've managed to aggravate a tendon in my shoulder.

80
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And it's actually pinching off nerves that run down to my arm and into my fingers.

81
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And so I'm actually in a sling and I'm kind of part of part of the part-way in the sling today

82
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
to be able to man the buttons to hear my other Mac go in the background there.

83
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And it's on overdrive.

84
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's nice the day.

85
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's about 23, 24 degrees centigrade.

86
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's been good.

87
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And of course what still dominates the news is the terrorist attacks yesterday in London.

88
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And people were asked if you didn't have to drive into London, please don't.

89
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you could stay at home, please stay at home.

90
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now we had a trip planned for the city tomorrow Saturday.

91
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And we wanted to go see the crown jewels at the tower and want to walk around, want to go on the London Eye.

92
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And so what we're going to do is we're going to wait.

93
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And if the word is, you know, please stay home.

94
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Then we'll stay home.

95
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If the word is open for business, we're definitely going.

96
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And really, that's the general vibe here is, you know, this was a cowardly attack.

97
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And we're not going to let it bring us down.

98
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We're going to try it in the forties with the Blitz Creek.

99
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They went through it in the 80s and the 90s with the IRA.

100
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And, you know, it's tough, tough cookies here.

101
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let me tell you, New York, a former New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani was in London.

102
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I guess by coincidence, maybe for the G8 that he was in the neighborhood.

103
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And he said that the way the Londoner's responded was very admirable.

104
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I believe that completely, it's just amazing how,

105
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
how the press is taking this.

106
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And also, something of nowhere to be.

107
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think the BBC does not, I'm sure they have really horrible footage.

108
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But they just don't show it.

109
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They do have doctors on talking about, you know, all the horrible things that happened to people,

110
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
victims of a bomb blast literally talking about dismemberment.

111
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But they don't show it.

112
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And that, I think, deafening.

113
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And they also, they don't, they haven't been overhyping this the way.

114
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The, um, that has probably been done in the States to haven't seen any of the footage,

115
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
but some people have told me that already the graphics are swirling.

116
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And, you know, the war on terror took them to the drums come in.

117
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And this was handled very professionally like, like any,

118
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
a humongous news event.

119
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But with the, with a certain amount of dignity in class that is definitely to be commended.

120
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
A little disappointing, I have to say, is, um,

121
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think that lots of people have, um,

122
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
phone cams, because they were showing a lot of that footage on, uh, on TV on the BBC,

123
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Sky News, ITV, they were showing, uh, video footage that were showing camera pictures.

124
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But I just didn't see a heck of a lot show up on web logs.

125
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It seems like there's some disconnect between these mobile phones.

126
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And, uh, and, uh, however, you know, wherever the pictures go,

127
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I know that people, uh, keep them on the phone a lot and trade them out through Bluetooth and,

128
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and other means and picture messaging is pretty big here in the UK.

129
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But it seems like they're still disconnect with getting them onto the web,

130
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
but it seems like there's a lot of links in some form structured like a web log where we can really find it.

131
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So stuff to work on, uh, as we continue to take back the media into our own hands.

132
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, yes. And, oh, yeah, this was amazing.

133
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Um, I couldn't believe it, although I did see a report, um, on the BBC News website,

134
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
which I'll put a link to it in the, in the show notes for today's podcast,

135
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that apparently some hotels doubled the price of a room, uh, Thursday night last night.

136
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Which is called price gouging. In the States, if you do that, if you're a price gouging,

137
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
man, you get, you get tired and feathered and driven out of town.

138
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I mean, that is just, you know, unacceptable in, in US culture.

139
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And I can't believe that, that hotels would do that.

140
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Now, I'll, I'll say upfront that this was the BBC reporting apparently on, um,

141
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
last minute.com, uh, who had warned its members that hotel prices were doubling.

142
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Um, but there's not a mention of a single hotel, uh, which, you know,

143
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and then I always got to wonder, okay, how come, you know, you, you don't just tell us which hotels

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
were doing that so that we could, you know, take a consumer action.

145
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Um, I can only assume because it's unconfirmed.

146
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And, uh, the same goes for the al Qaeda group that has claimed responsibility.

147
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think it's secrets of the underground al Qaeda or something like that.

148
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And, you know, apparently there's this website that had, um,

149
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
a statement on it claiming, uh, the terrorist bombings.

150
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But they never linked to it from any of these stories.

151
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I mean, what is that all about?

152
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And then I go to Google and I type in the exact name of that group.

153
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And, you know, there's no website that pops up, you know, that, that is connected to that.

154
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So, like, uh, some of that stuff, uh, you just, you just got a wonder.

155
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's all.

156
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So anyway, I'm sure that, uh, we'll get to the bottom of this.

157
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And, uh, you know, the, uh, the United Kingdom and London in particular is so wired.

158
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There's so many, what they call CCTV cameras.

159
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So close caption, I guess.

160
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Or, yeah, close caption.

161
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
How does it make sense?

162
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Close circuit.

163
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sorry, close circuit televisions.

164
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Stores have them.

165
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Every street corner has them.

166
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So I think they can probably follow, for instance, for the two,

167
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
it'll be a little more difficult, I'm afraid.

168
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But for the, um, for the bus that was blowing up,

169
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
they can probably follow the entire route and see who got on and, uh,

170
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and what they were carrying and, you know, it's, uh, and it's pretty high quality stuff.

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And they use it all the time and they really do.

172
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It is very, very effective.

173
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So, let's get them.

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's hope we can get them.

175
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

176
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Daily source code.

177
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What are we at now?

178
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We're at, uh, 16 minutes.

179
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay, we're right on track.

180
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Um, let me see.

181
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I do have some promo's lined up for you.

182
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's get to those.

183
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Hot chill.

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

Skeptocality.com presents real skeptical thinkers.

186

Seals.

187
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Skeptical thinkers.

188
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Today we salute you the independent podcast creator.

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,000
When you believe everyone else is selling out, joining Pod Show, signing up for

190
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
ODO and submitting to iTunes, you are standing firm.

191
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Quietly hoping for listeners and losing sleep.

192
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It really makes no matter whether your show is just you and a cheap microphone,

193
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
chatting aimlessly about your day or you and your wife discussing each other's private parts

194
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
or just to show about new music.

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I love the positive news.

196
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Without you, the rest of us podcasters would lose our perspective and believe that pod casting

197
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
is losing ground to corporate greed.

198
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Apple iTunes or the cult of the pod father.

199
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So thank you, Mr. Independent Podcast creator.

200
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Without you, Podcast Pickle, Idiot Vox, Podcast Ellie and all other podcasters

201
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
directories on the internet would just be, well, full of popular podcasters.

202
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And for that, many of us can actually go on with our lives and know that you are out there

203
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
keeping the number of podcasters inflated for the media.

204
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000

That's great.

Not the calm of the Skepticality.

211
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Truth in Podcast.

212
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Watch out.

213
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You've been assimilated into the cult of the pod father.

214
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
By the way, there was a mention of Podcast Ellie in there.

215
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let me tell you something cool about Podcast Ellie.

216
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I've been receiving a lot of email, a lot about iTunes and about the feeds that they use

217
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
about being listed in the directory.

218
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
First of all, the directory, they're doing that themselves.

219
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They populated it with the iPod.org directory.

220
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's tough.

221
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's tough doing a directory.

222
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And so I'm trying to see if we can get that a little bit more one-on-one because we have all

223
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
these volunteers that I potted.org who are essentially maintaining all these nodes.

224
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Marcus, by the way, has now installed the new servers.

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Hopefully we'll be able to get a more stable iPod.org for you.

226
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's just been so overloaded with requests.

227
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Let's see where it was.

228
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a lot easier to maintain it that way through a distributed way.

229
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Because that's what you need when you want.

230
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We need to do a big directory.

231
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That makes a lot of sense.

232
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And then let's put an OPML output of the iTunes directory somewhere on the back end.

233
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So that can be used for yet more directories.

234
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It makes a total sense.

235
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So working on that.

236
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But a lot of people are want to have an iTunes compatible feed.

237
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And if you go to Podcast Ellie and you're registered there, you have your podcast registered

238
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
but just thought every single one of them is, then you automatically get an iTunes feed,

239
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
which you can submit into iTunes if you're not listed already.

240
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And right now it's just a podcast Ellie slash and some kind of URL.

241
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What we're working on is the ability for you to map a domain name to that feed.

242
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So you could actually have it be whatever.yourpodcast.com or RSS.yourpodcast.com,

243
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
something like that.

244
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And then you would be able to, if you wanted to, you could move away, which, you know,

245
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
basically mitigates, that's the right word mitigates lock in.

246
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So it just takes, get it to get rid of it.

247
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So we're working on that.

248
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We're just working as fast as we can.

249
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Basically.

250
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So that is something that's really easy.

251
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If you want to have an iTunes compatible feed podcast.

252
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Sally provides them.

253
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Just make sure you're listed in their database.

254
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Something I wanted to say, I wanted to ask if there were any comedians who are out there

255
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
who are interested in doing stuff with audio and with podcasting if, you know,

256
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
if you're funny.

257
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I'm thinking maybe Ron and I on my next trip out west will go to a comedy club

258
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and we'll approach some of the comedians that, you know, if they're any good, hopefully.

259
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But if you, if you, or you know someone who's comedian,

260
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
send me an MP3 with some of your stuff, we've got some ideas that might be very cool

261
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
if you're interested in doing some stuff.

262
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And I get a lot of comments from, well, podcast Paul has mentioned it to me before.

263
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And he feels that the source code definitely doesn't pay enough attention to podcasts from the UK.

264
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So I was scouting around today looking actually for, you know, any type of podcast from yesterday

265
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
if anything was was up and about and I hadn't found any.

266
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But I did find something very interesting from James Gardner,

267
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
but the person who creates the, I think it's the wake up internet podcast.

268
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I wanted to share just a little bit of that podcast with you.

269
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Nice little sound imaging.

270
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There you go.

271
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Adam Curry, web pioneer.

272
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh, don't shout.

273
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You decide.

274
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Hold on.

275
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hey, baby.

276
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What's that?

277
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, thank you.

278
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
William Curry, Sam.

279
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yeah.

280
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Nice.

281
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I think that I can't eat.

282
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, look at what.

283
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I want to give my right arm to you.

284
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, you can add my left ones.

285
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Fucked up enough.

286
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
All right.

287
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Thanks, baby.

288
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

289
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I should actually restart that.

290
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Hold on a second because I was so funny.

291
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Hey, listen to what he calls me.

292
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Wake up internet.lux.com.

293
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Adam Curry, web pioneer.

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh, gobsite.

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Okay, gobsite.

296
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I looked it up.

297
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
A person regarded as mean or contemptible.

298
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
A gobsite.

299
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You decide.

300
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Like millions of other iTunes users who upgraded to version 4.9 for its integrated podcast features.

301
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I rediscovered Adam Curry this week.

302
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I see rediscovered because I'd become aware of him where back in the middle of last year

303
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
when the BBC first brought the concept of podcasting to my attention.

304
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Having just listened to him for half an hour on the topics of ranging from podcasting

305
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
to him getting his pilot's license and his never minded ill informed opinions on the live it

306
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
concert.

307
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm firmly of the opinion he is irrelevant and will remain so until he stops podcasting about podcasting

308
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and how its very future depends on him and starts actually telling us something worth knowing.

309
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The pioneer of podcasting he may come to be recognized as.

310
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Even lorded over us as in the future.

311
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
He's simply not deserved in the light of the web nostalgia for what was hit last week.

312
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He seems to have the whole of the west coast of America convinced is actually important, even viral.

313
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So I hear by predict within the next year to a year and a half he'll be as relevant to podcasting

314
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
as Bill Gates is to open source software development.

315
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This guy's great.

316
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Okay, I have some comments about this but I wait until the end.

317
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
This is good.

318
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The analogy being that while it was windows and Microsoft which dragged the price of the humble

319
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
scene down to realistic levels in the mid to late 1990s, it was this very increase in availability

320
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
which made the impons for an alternative to the windows operating system all the more pressing.

321
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Similarly, Adam Curry inspires the DJ or in Osol to sit in a dark and room when a bright sunny day

322
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
talking to ourselves and pretending like a bunch of seven year olds playing the radio DJ game.

323
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But someone is actually listening and if they are listening they actually care what we're talking about.

324
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Okay, now this is the part where you're going off track.

325
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So I'm going to let you finish up your statement here but you're wrong about a couple things.

326
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Not because it's important or vital that podcasting succeeds and our involvement is key to it,

327
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
but because the net nerd in Osol feeds on failing like we understand new possibilities.

328
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The possibilities thrown up by the latest trend in information delivery systems.

329
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Just as everybody once led claim to having the most popular channel on down that,

330
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
who only days after founding it realized it's sucked to use the command prompt interface.

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So all the majority of startup podcasters will drift back into obscurity.

332
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Just as everyone who ever shared a file on Napster spend those nail biting weeks,

333
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
waiting for Lars Ulrich to come knocking on their door, demanding his royalty check.

334
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So all will the podcasts about how cool it is to be young, white, middle-class student of computers,

335
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
in the bare area, realize the banality of their life and move on to the next big thing that further serves

336
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
to reinforce their faith in all its narrow and thoughtless.

337
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Okay, all right James, so here's, you know, and I hear this a lot,

338
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
or people say, well, you know, it's just like web logs and it's all crap.

339
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, first of all, it's not.

340
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But there's a distinct difference here between what happened with web logs and what happened with podcasting.

341
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What happened with web logs, it wasn't an inherent desire to publish.

342
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
People wanted to have a voice to have a way to get their message out.

343
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And podcasting, it was the reverse.

344
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
People are dissatisfied with what they were hearing and they were demanding to hear something different.

345
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's not like with publishing of text and pictures and print and magazines where the supply is just endless.

346
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
There was a very limited scope of receptions to be made.

347
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
There's limited the number of channels, even though it seems like there's a lot,

348
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
but also the centralized infrastructure does not allow for all these channels to be of, you know,

349
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
to have original programming, first run programming,

350
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
which is why reality television has, has caught on so, so big because it's very efficient to make.

351
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's what television producers and television broadcasters love about it.

352
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And people watch it.

353
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
They, I don't know, I didn't want to say they like it, but they do watch it.

354
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So it's a listener demand driven medium podcasting is.

355
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And it's, you know, not that we're all looking for the next top 40 radio station or show.

356
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We're looking for something fresh, something new, and we're rediscovering all this.

357
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The web tried to go from text and pictures to video.

358
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And it kind of bypassed audio.

359
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, we had a little touching go there because audio was music.

360
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
No, audio is so much more stuff that we, oh man, we have forgotten more than we have to learn.

361
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm telling you.

362
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So we're just going to slowly get back into it.

363
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And it's going to be very, very cool.

364
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, let me plug something here.

365
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
If you're interested in making a podcast, go to castblaster.com.

366
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That's what we have.

367
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The beta version of our podcast creation software is there.

368
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's windows only at this point in time.

369
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Lots of people asking for a Mac version.

370
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It always takes longer because the focus is on the window stuff right now.

371
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But, you know, we've talked about this before.

372
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm a Mac guy, so I'd love to have it on a Mac.

373
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So that, you know, that is definite directive.

374
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I think you can create a 10 minute podcast with the beta version.

375
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And you'll be able to do that forever with the beta.

376
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Even when it goes 1.0.

377
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And all you have to get from there on is hosting.

378
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And that too hopefully will change in the very near future with more pod show offerings.

379
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Let me just see what else I had.

380
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean, it's such a shell shock isn't the right word.

381
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But I'm in a very, you know, kind of a mellowish mood because it's just so weird over here right now.

382
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You know, you can't really be happy.

383
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You can't, you don't want to be too upbeat because it just doesn't feel appropriate right now.

384
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This stuff has been shocking.

385
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It really has.

386
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Okay.

387
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Let me see.

388
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
People, what do I want to say?

389
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Oh, yeah, Michael Butler has a new.

390
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's the rock and roll geek.

391
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Michael Butler has a new podcast.

392
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You can find it is rock and roll geek show rock and roll geek show dot com.

393
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But now he has the indie cast, which is all pod safe music.

394
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's a rock and roll geek dot org.

395
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And I was listening to it.

396
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And that was rocking.

397
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It was really, it was really, really good.

398
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So you want to give that a check.

399
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And Michael's also been doing lots of interviews with.

400
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So pretty big name.

401
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah.

402
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Christina, I'm flat on from Divinals.

403
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh, man.

404
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah.

405
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I love this three part series with Kenny Laguna, who's president of black heart records and

406
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Joan Jets manager.

407
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And he played in Tommy James in the Shondales.

408
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
He had a lot of really cool rock and roll stories to talk about.

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And it was great.

410
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I had to cut up a three part to us all along.

411
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And there's a guy in Australia named Tom Schooting, who, I guess he used to live in the Netherlands.

412
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It sounds like a Dutch name.

413
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So I'm just going to presume that.

414
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But he lives in Australia.

415
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And he was a, he's a big fan of a radio show I used to do in the early 80s.

416
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm talking 81, 82, called Curry and Funinkle, which I did with a partner.

417
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You're doing Funinkle.

418
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And he had to tape the whole bunch of these shows.

419
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And when podcast came along, he started putting up feeds of this show as a podcast.

420
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I did what I think, and in hindsight, I think it's a really, really good idea is

421
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
when we move from the castle, I was getting rid of all the all our stuff.

422
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You know, just trying to get rid of masses amounts of stuff.

423
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I had a huge cardboard box filled with cassette tapes, cassette tapes from my work at

424
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Radio Veronica with Curry and Veninkle.

425
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Apparently also some of my early stuff on the pirate radio station.

426
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And I told you that I worked for radio decibel in Amsterdam.

427
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And I was, I think, either 16 or 17, probably 16 years old at the time.

428
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, I think I just was old enough to ride a motorbike.

429
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And I called myself John Holden because it was a legal station.

430
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So you couldn't use your real name.

431
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You had to have like a DJ name.

432
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because, you know, they would eventually find you or find us and confiscate the transmitters.

433
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And just, I was kind of the on-vogue at the time.

434
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You use an alias.

435
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And so I pretended I was 24.

436
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That was my whole stick.

437
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And if you listen to the voice, it's like, no way.

438
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Didn't couldn't even pull off, you know, 19.

439
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So just, just hear a little bit of it.

440
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And I'll tell you what I thought I was going to listen to more of this tape.

441
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Anyway, this came from the podcast.

442
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And I'll put a link to that in the show notes, of course.

443
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Bring it down.

444
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Bring it down.

445
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Bring it down.

446
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Bring it down.

447
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Bring it down.

448
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Bring it down.

449
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Bring it down.

450
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Bring it down.

451
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Bring it down.

452
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Bring it down.

453
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah.

454
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Hey.

455
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:17,000
25 minutes passed noveenth o'clock and we will begin.

456
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Giving away let's see four or five free albums.

457
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And as my photography giving away one right now.

458
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So collar number five on one eight four one six eight.

459
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You will win the new dire streets double album, I believe.

460
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Yeah, you hear that sweeper there?

461
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
I'm six, two, and stand there.

462
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,400
We spun down my boys to make it sound really low.

463
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,800
So, you know, like the song you're hearing now,

464
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,000
they're a whole, but I just listened to this whole hour-long podcast,

465
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
which of course, you know, wasn't just a podcast,

466
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,200
but it was actually, you know, a full couple hours of radio show.

467
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
And the music we were playing at the time,

468
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,800
that was really the whole reason that it existed,

469
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,200
is because we were into that type of music

470
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,000
and it wasn't being played on the radio.

471
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,600
So, I, you know, kind of doing automatic analogy

472
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,000
to our pod-safe music,

473
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and I went back into the bin and pulled out Buffy girl.

474
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
That's just too.

475
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,000
Hope you like it.

476
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You're so right, it doesn't make sense.

477
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,400
So put the fact that I never even asked in the past films.

478
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,800
It wouldn't be right to give my heart away.

479
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,800
But something is thinking,

480
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
and it couldn't be hope,

481
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
because hope could just flow away.

482
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Whatever it is, I have to let it slide.

483
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,800
But I could say your paintings everywhere I go.

484
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:01,800
And I hear your music playing in the back of my mind,

485
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
all the time.

486
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Ooh.

487
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,800
I already knew that you could never be for me,

488
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,800
what I could never be for you.

489
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,800
But so many times I follow any way.

490
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,800
And my heart is thinking,

491
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,800
because my heart's a little heavy for a man I can't explain.

492
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,800
You leave all your windows open in the rain.

493
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:51,800
And I can see your smile in every smile I see.

494
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Every time I leave, I turn my head to see you all smile in back of me.

495
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,800
That I don't need you.

496
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,800
And I can see your paintings everywhere I go.

497
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,800
I hear your music playing in the back of my mind, all the time.

498
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
You're so right.

499
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,800
You're so right.

500
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,800
You're so right.

501
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Buffy Girl, everywhere I go.

502
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
It's Pod Safe.

503
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
You heard it here on the Daily Source Code.

504
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Link to Buffy Girl's website can be found on the show notes for today's Daily Source Code

505
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,800
for July 8th, 2005.

506
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,800
All right.

507
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,800
So yeah, I've kind of wrapped up most of the work I needed to do this week.

508
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Got some phone calls and stuff coming up.

509
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,800
But it's five after four Friday afternoon.

510
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,800
I'm ready for the weekend.

511
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,800
I certainly hope you are.

512
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Monday will start off with a fresh new week.

513
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,800
We'll be cranking it out.

514
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,800
If you want to subscribe to the Daily Source Code,

515
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
you can do that through iTunes.

516
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Just go into the podcast tab and search for Adam Curry or Daily Source Code.

517
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
You can also go to data sourcecode.com.

518
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Now, here's something cool if you're using iTunes.

519
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,800
If you're using Safari and iTunes, I have to say.

520
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,800
If you see a white on orange XML link for a podcast or just a link to a podcast,

521
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,800
you can actually drag that right into iTunes and your podcast to have.

522
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
What an hour!

523
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
It's automatic.

524
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
You subscribe to me.

525
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Of course, you can use that for any iPod or pod catcher,

526
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,800
such as iPod or iPod or the lemon version.

527
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Adam Curry.com is my email address.

528
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
You can send me audio feedback there if you wish.

529
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm going to get pretty close to the limit again.

530
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,800
2 gigabytes worth of Gmail so far used.

531
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Where's my infinity plus?

532
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
My infinity plus one, guys.

533
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Time to upgrade to another gigabit there.

534
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Make it three.

535
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,800
www.curry.com is the weblog.

536
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,800
I will see you Monday for sure.

537
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Maybe over the weekend.

538
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Have yourself a good one. Bye-bye.

539
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:10,800
www.curry.com

540
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Another pod show podcast.

541
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Stick it in your ear.
