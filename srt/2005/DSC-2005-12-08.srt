Welcome to Better Bad News, and in the news today, Adam Curry did not take credit for someone

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,280
else's work today.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,720
He is, however, rewriting world history and you will be surprised that the things Adam

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,320
Curry has done.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,840
Adam Curry has never gotten the credit he deserves for inventing flannel socks, really simple

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,760
flannel socks.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,240

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,480

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,640
Adam Curry wrote large sections of Leviticus, but nobody can translate it for instance,

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,360
what does this mean?

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Be not unclean in fields during the time of month reserved for unsubstantiated rumors regarding

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,760
the new attitude at Google.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,240

that a lot of stuff has been popping up we talked about some of that yesterday bad

66
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,960
news here I don't don't don't you know don't worry too much but the bad news is

67
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,360
our community mac in the office the one the old G four power no the was that

68
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,600
titanium the titanium power book that man I've had that one for four years I

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,920
think the screened crapped out I've had that connected to a cinema display the

70
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,520
old model for years I think yeah maybe even maybe even two years and this

71
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,600
morning this is what Patricia uses to get her email and you know it's been

72
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,160
meticulously set up the setup I have but of course I don't have a backup of the

73
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,760
most recent information which would include some of her emails although she

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,840
seems to clean out her email box pretty regularly yeah the drive crash and no

75
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,560
warning this time it just went and then couldn't get it to reboot put in the OSX

76
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,760
pardon emwa the OS 10 startup CD no drive recognized for fact so what and it's

77
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,640
not it's not that I wasn't expecting this to happen sooner or later or that we

78
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,040
had to replace the mac is just now I don't really have time before I leave for

79
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,400
San Francisco to to get a new mac and at the same time to install it so that

80
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,320
it works for Patricia because she does have a certain configuration to use to

81
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,360
so big time bummer yes and he asked you about the rules of Canada

82
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,480
France and about the commercial radio and Germany now comic strip blogger

83
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,760
our buddy on the comments at curie dot com posted a pretty interesting piece

84
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,320
about German commercial radio seems that they have very weak signals and it

85
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,560
really isn't much of an industry but I got an interesting email from Jason

86
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,680
Bryant about Canadian music radio laws and he knows what he's talking

87
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,280
about he says well I actually agreed the first paragraph here on data source

88
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,520
got to 92 you mentioned Canada's rules regarding Canadian content as a

89
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,040
tenure veteran of broadcasting I am all too familiar with Canadian content or

90
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,200
Kant Kant as it's referred to Kant Kant a Canada radio stations must play

91
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,200
a minimum of 35% Canadian content Monday to Fridays between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.

92
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,600
okay I thought it was much higher stations must also play 35% Kant Kant between

93
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,880
6 a.m. and 12 midnight Monday to Sunday

94
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,200
uh wait a minute that doesn't make a lot of sense well they break down the

95
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,520
time slots like this so stay show okay they break down the time slots like

96
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,240
the so stations have to play 35% during peak times and not just load up the

97
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,120
evening show with Kant Kant okay I got you so 35% is not that bad actually

98
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,680
I think I you know probably a lot of this is a commercial radio in Canada

99
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,800
that's the other question I had um he uh he goes on to say a couple of very

100
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,800
interesting things but in short he says protectionism protectionism protectionism

101
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,160
and over regulation do not work I can only hope our government continues to

102
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,760
move in the direction of free speech and choice as for me I no longer work full-time

103
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,520
in radio I do voiceovers I'm an actor I recently worked on the movie just

104
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,800
friends with Ryan Reynolds which was released by Newcaste in the last month and

105
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,680
I also started a podcast new human podcast with Jason Ryan okay Jason thank you

106
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,000
very much I hope you post this on your uh on your web blog or talk about on your

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,400
podcast because I think it'll be good to know a little bit more about that and I came

108
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,640
across actually I'm subscribed to on the record this is from ipressroom.com this is

109
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,840
the show that I played you a snippet from when Ron was interviewed he has a

110
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,120
special episode out and this this thing is fantastic you've got to listen to this

111
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,760
if you want you want to hear a history of podcasting listen how the

112
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,120
California copyright commission discusses this with a panel of experts so the

113
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,920
California copyright commission podcasting panel in this podcast features

114
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,000
Anthony Bruno of billboard magazine Bob left sets of the left sets letter and

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,880
attorney Kevin Cole-off and attorney John Ajash Waddles and they go on the record

116
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,080
online on how the recording industry is dealing with the challenges post a

117
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,640
podcast by podcasters to the traditional business of music licensing and you

118
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,160
have got to listen to this first of all there's at one point there's someone

119
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,320
is explaining podcasting and says well Adam Curry you got fired from MTV like whoa

120
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,240
that's new sorry I think I left my own record I don't think I got fired but

121
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,080
you should listen to how they would to first of all to what their

122
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,240
understanding is of the concept of podcasting I heard one quote in there saying well

123
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,320
I don't really think there's anyone listening oh man oh that really blew me away

124
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,800
but most of these guys hadn't heard of podcasting until just very recently it seemed

125
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,000
like the audience was switched on and I don't know if was someone on the panel because

126
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,280
it's very hard to hear it's recorded with an omnidirectional mic just kind of like

127
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,840
sticking up in the air someone actually either on the panel in the audience was very

128
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:59,960
switched on it was you know was talking about different business models and but

129
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,280
essentially why this is working on what mainstream media has done to drive particularly

130
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,520
radio has done to drive people to podcasting so it's just fascinating to listen to

131
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,480
please listen to the legal conversation about copyrighted music and you can almost

132
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,960
feel where they're coming from no you can feel it they all they in fact they say

133
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,320
where they're coming from and I really encourage you to listen to this

134
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,920
if you're interested in pod safe music or licenses that will come and they are coming

135
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,520
this memory talked about the association of independent music which is musicindy.com

136
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,320
I gave out the wrong website address the other day musicindy.com so that's a UK

137
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,680
organization they have I believe 300 independent record labels and they are coming out with

138
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,760
licenses they've announced it first they told the BBC was coming out then they announced it

139
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,520
which have done now they still haven't published the licenses apparently you have to call them up

140
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,840
and then they'll do deal with you based on an individual you know on an individual basis but

141
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,720
now they don't say outright that everyone has to pay money so if you have a I think if you have

142
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,000
a podcast that you're not making any money from that they may give you a license or a very

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,640
normal fee but they're definitely out to get some money from podcasting and they will have

144
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:23,240
time limitations so details are still not available which is unfortunate you know I yeah

145
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,720
I'd like to know more about it but I think they should be announcing and we shouldn't have to go

146
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,720
requesting that seems a little backwards to me at least that's my personal feeling about that first song

147
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:42,200
guitar shop asshole I heard that where did I hear that song topless girl is the name of the song

148
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:50,040
I heard it on extra backshaw big mic played it and it's rough it's it's hard it's it's punk

149
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,880
but it really took me back 20 years in time like yeah I remember I used to be able to pogo for more

150
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:04,120
than three seconds before falling down and the controversy the controversy continues surrounding

151
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:12,120
the podcast hijacking it seems to be the most discussed topic on the podcasters email list

152
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,640
at Yahoo I really really do not like in fact I've probably propelled this myself a little bit

153
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,200
but I really don't like the whole concept of the word hijacking when it comes to this story because it

154
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,480
seems like there's just a small lack of understanding between two parties I'm not even sure if

155
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,680
they're now if it's all worked out or if they're friends yet but to call it hijacking you know

156
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,920
that's really what gets you know and I don't think this has been a main a big mainstream press

157
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,520
article just yet but keep calling it hijacking and it will be you know that's the whole idea

158
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,360
hijacking podcasts it's two really sexy words that you just put next to each other and I think we

159
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:00,280
want to stay away from doing that and hopefully it'll work itself out in the course of the next

160
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,280
next couple of days now it may not be your cup of tea but I encourage you to listen to this song

161
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,280

take to put that together three days four days there you go once again I've invented something for

247
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,680
that was that was you know that was that was that was that was a long way to go to for a promo

250
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:48,760
is what that was more feedback about the music industry please this isn't I even though

251
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,440
we're having some fun here today this is a pretty important show there's some important stuff

252
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,600
that's that's happening I believe that the RIA affiliate members are starting to wake up and figure

253
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:05,320
out what podcasting is and I don't care what you play just make sure you have permission to play it

254
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,360
make sure you've got both bases covered people ask me this all the time you have to have

255
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,000
permission from the owner of the master so say do you own the masters yes okay could you please say

256
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,280
you was owner of the master's give me permission and you have to have a waiver on the ask cap

257
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,680
be in my broadcast rights so that's also it can just be an email I think is probably sufficient

258
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:34,840
these days but you have to have permission and you know in hindsight man it was good that

259
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,440
the bronze musician and I'm a broadcast or slash podcaster because we it's almost like we

260
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,240
first saw this coming you know that's what the pod save music network is about is that you have an

261
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,560
automatic license just by signing up as a podcaster or as an artist and if you have any troubles

262
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,520
figuring it out email either Michael Butler or a CC chap and probably if you're a podcaster

263
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,040
a CC can help you and and if you're an artist and you're interested Michael Butler can help you

264
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:11,800
and feel free to CC me so I can add some signal to noise ratio in there hello Adam my name is Omar

265
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,560
and I live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and I wanted to let you know about something that really

266
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:25,000
ticked me off and has a lot to do with licensing and the music industry and all that but I don't know

267
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,080
if you've heard about this particular twist on it I like a lot of people use the widgets feature of OS 10

268
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:42,040
on my Mac and I really like using this one which it called Paralyrics and it's written by a guy

269
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,960
at the pairworks.com it's a great little widget and like so many others that have been around

270
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,040
when you play your music and iTunes it automatically goes online and displays the lyrics to a song

271
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:02,920
essentially it's really just a fancy web browser because it's getting what's already on the internet

272
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,800
on those lyrics website. Well I wanted to go and get a more current version because I had a

273
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,680
dot four beta version of it and I go to his website and come to find out he got a cease and the

274
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:22,840
cis letter apparently a widget that goes out and gets lyrics is now illegal and the studios don't

275
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:30,840
like it so I looked around and found out that almost all the lyrics if not all of the lyrics

276
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,600
reading widgets on Apple's website which list all the dashboard widgets available are gone.

277
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,240
So now apparently the music industry is going after applications that simply go to the web

278
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,640
and get lyrics are already posted on websites and I don't know if they're going after websites

279
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,400
that post lyrics now but it seems that it's getting a little out of control when you can't even

280
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,880
read the lyrics to a song that that you may or may not own and it just really bugged me and I thought

281
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,320
I'd like you know that this is going on that even lyrics are being wiped off of the internet.

282
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,760
So you and the folks at Pawt Show keep up to good work and the revolution goes on.

283
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Yeah, Vivalada overly was gone!

284
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,160
Yeah indeed that's kind of interesting that that would happen now Omar.

285
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:29,400
There was a time on the internet when there was a huge issue before the RIA I think was really

286
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,880
organized well enough to do what they're doing now which is combating and protecting their

287
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,120
copyrights. There was an issue over not just lyrics but also guitar, a tablature.

288
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,280
So printouts of what the chords are that are used and that's a publishing right.

289
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,200
You know if you write something, if you find something in a book,

290
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:58,200
unless it's under fair use you cannot just publish that legally because there's copyright on it and

291
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,360
fair use is a really fuzzy thing. Although it's very clearly defined still I find it a bit fuzzy but

292
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,840
regardless. So now I think that the the music publishers are seeing that this probably not much

293
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,320
you can do about it and I think that was it probably still is quite a significant revenue stream.

294
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:22,360
lyrics song books teach yourself how to play something with lyrics. You know that's when when

295
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,480
you print up a book like that there's royalties to be paid to the owners of the copyrights of the

296
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,120
words and of the music of the actual score. The notes that are used. It's a very complicated

297
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:40,440
stuff. I'm you know we all know I'm not a lawyer but I think that what the I don't you didn't

298
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,840
mention who these seasons assist letter came from but probably from the RIA or affiliated company

299
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,200
or a publisher's organization. I don't think they probably realized by now there's no stopping it

300
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,640
you know you can probably shut down some big sites. I don't know if there's been any news about that

301
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,880
recently. I always seem to be able to find something through Google if I'm looking for lyrics.

302
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,760
But I guess what they're trying to do is go to the next level which is stop the application that is

303
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,400
closest to you that deals with this infringement. Now personally I think it's I agree with you.

304
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:20,440
I think it's stupid you know I think that there's still a very valid market for publishing lyrics

305
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:28,120
and and score a music in paper written form. I think that lots of people will continue to buy that

306
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,760
but I can see all kinds of reasons why you would not want to restrict access to that information

307
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,040
online. So just be prepared for it because that's they're going to crack down on everything and this

308
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,920
is what happens. You know the radio industry was already on its last legs which arguably could have

309
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:52,280
gone on forever had you know had podcasting not arrived had satellite radio not come into threaten

310
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,480
the scene. iPods in general just people listening to music their way being control of their own

311
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:06,760
programming but they were consolidated and that's usually the last gas of any industry is consolidation

312
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,800
and so it's not really true there's only a couple of players. There are many players still certainly

313
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,800
on a global aspect but in the United States there are a couple of players who own a shitload of

314
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,120
frequencies same thing with the music business they've been they're consolidating they're now

315
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:28,440
really three big labels who work on on the traditional models and who make up the RIA and that's EMI

316
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,320
Sony and Warner Warner Brothers time Warner and and so now they're you know they're just going

317
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,840
after everything they can. There's no more creativity left in that industry. I've been to Warner

318
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,600
I've been to Sony not the EMI but I've been to two of the top three and the carpets of

319
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,640
frying you know it's all you see is suits and lawyers there's no music blasting through the hallways

320
00:31:51,640 --> 00:32:00,680
a very different scene than say only 10 years ago so I think someone's run a little bit of

321
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:06,280
stray of the airport so that's really who's running the show over there and that's about it just

322
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:13,480
be very very careful what you're doing because as we grow as we as you know every listener we take

323
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,320
away from mainstream media that's a loss for them and that's the way they see it and they're going to

324
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,560
come after anything they can the same way they did with filed and continue to do with file sharing.

325
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,720
Hey Adam this is Robert Cole the internal candidate a long time listener to the daily source code

326
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,240
and soon to be co-host of the think big for 13 minutes podcast but that's not what this message is about

327
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,920
you often tell your listeners to send you a link to a audio file you want audio feedback you just

328
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,280
say put the file up somewhere on a server somewhere but most people don't have a server somewhere so

329
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,680
the thing that I try to use for you and we'll see if it makes it on to the air the daily source code

330
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,920
is you send it.com you send it.com is up you can transfer up to a gigabyte file we're trying this

331
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,880
with the way file for you to get this message and if it worked you'll get it on the daily source code

332
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,040
or you'll tell people about it if it didn't work well I'll never hear about it but again if you send

333
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,320
it.com it's a server you can just put large files up to a gigabyte there and daily source code

334
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,440
people that don't have a server to put a file up to now can do it anyway from Toronto Canada where

335
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,040
I'm freezing in the cold I'll see you on the flip side now everybody thank you well I really only

336
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,280
played this to let you know that it did make it through here's the reason why I asked people

337
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,720
to make MP3s and put them on servers I don't want to make it too easy certainly you can use

338
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:38,680
voicemail and I know you can use services like what do I have a J2 number that you can call

339
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,720
up and leave a voicemail it's sent to me as an audio file not an MP3 but at least something that

340
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:51,240
I can open and convert if I want to I can play easily it's at a.au or probably one of those mobile

341
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,360
formats that it leaves that you get now but you know if I make it that easy then I'm going to spend

342
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:03,640
a lot of time listening to you know a lot of comments that may be very very long and when someone

343
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,040
has to go through the trouble of creating the MP3 file putting it up on the server doing the

344
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,920
ID3 tags not only does it make my life easier I think it really does filter out the quality of

345
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,280
the feedback you know if you really want to say something here's what you're going to have to do

346
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,400
and otherwise just no way if me to get through all this crap it's unbelievable how much I'm getting

347
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:28,040
and let me just give you a current Gmail quota I can't remember exactly when they upgraded me to

348
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:36,440
four gigs which was of course extremely cool let's see it can only have been maybe a month

349
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:43,560
two months maybe at most I think let me just log into the Gmail right now and see what see what the

350
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,800
current quota is. Man it takes sometimes it really takes a long time here we go.

351
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,840
92 percent three seven five five three thousand seven hundred fifty five megabytes of your

352
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:04,360
four thousand ninety six megabytes so I'm already 92 percent it's going to it's I wonder since

353
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:10,040
they put me on some kind of manual manual sizing if it'll grow as I start to approach the

354
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:16,760
99 to 100 percent or if I'll have to start begging me I really love it though and I gladly pay for

355
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,640
just tell me how much you want me to pay for the storage people tell me all the time they send me emails

356
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,680
about these thirty gigabyte some email services the one hundred gigabyte email services that's

357
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:33,000
not what it's about what it's about for me is the email program itself the way it works is fantastic

358
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,560
the whole idea of not throwing anything out but really using the power of Google search to find

359
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,000
messages very quickly I have yet to see a service that does that well the short cut cut the key

360
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,840
key short cut commands it's just it's a fantastic service I really really love it so that's

361
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:55,240
why I just want to stay with it and if I can buy my gigs for storage please I'd be happy to and

362
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,160
I know I think that lots of other people would be happy to it's a great service not paid for this

363
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,200
endorsement by the way yeah and this is Charlie Thompson in Austin Texas it was great to hear

364
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,600
country western tune even though I'm a rock and roll or we live out here with our three

365
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Arabian horses and well you know country music goes along with that anyway my comment to you is

366
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,800
don't you think the ANR guys at the big record companies are digging through the pod safe music

367
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,640
network looking for potential stars I mean talk about a cheap ANR budget now they don't have to travel

368
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,600
from club to club to hear unsigned acts all they have to do is browse the PSM I'd love to hear

369
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,760
your comments on this Adam thanks cheers yeah well good bye cheers back at your buddy

370
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:46,200
Arabian horses nice well first of all I don't think any of them are doing that yet they will of course

371
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,120
they will and by the way I don't think you'll ever see an artist sign purely based upon

372
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,840
one song or a couple of songs record companies traditionally have a process although it's fuzzy and

373
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,360
can vary from executive to executive but there usually is a showcase involved because they want

374
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:09,160
to know what the band can do how they look how they perform you know are they right for MTV

375
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,560
all that stuff so yeah but you know what fantastic we want everyone to to discover new music I don't

376
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,640
care if if record company guys do what I think from the the pod safe artists I've spoken to many

377
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,840
of them have done the math and have figured out it just doesn't make any sense why would you want

378
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,880
a mainstream record deal you know a big co record deal why would you want that you will probably

379
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,040
sell more records if you are fortunate enough to be one of the small percentage that does actually

380
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:49,320
become successful through the through the the music business through the system but based upon

381
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,920
you know selling it directly to the listener with help of all you know your own marketing places

382
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:03,160
like my space but certainly with podcasts you may sell less records what you'll probably make

383
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,080
more money at the end of the day won't have to sue anyone over it won't be tied to the man

384
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,280
and you own your shit you own your own shit you don't need it I know plenty of pods here the

385
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,480
love spirals they've sold 50,000 records you know Angie B who sent me as wonderful wonderful

386
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:30,600
throaty feedback comments 50,000 records you know this stuff really does work I just don't think

387
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:36,200
that you need to resort to the mainstream record companies now there is something that's called the

388
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:43,000
distribution deal I think there's something very different with this distribution deal is I think

389
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,360
very exciting and that's if someone offers you a distribution deal you definitely should talk to them

390
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,920
because that means they can get your CD into stores this is what a lot of the smaller urban hip hop

391
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,480
R&B labels have with major companies and you know look at them you think those guys got some

392
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,240
bling whilst because they're doing it right because they got the money and they of course they also

393
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:11,720
take a whole bunch of risk associated with it because you know if you want to if you want to

394
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:17,000
get your record played then you will have you will be responsible for paying money to stations and by the

395
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,400
way it's exactly how it happens it goes through independent promotions companies but you know you'll

396
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,760
have to pay so only just settle the $10 million lawsuit in New York that spits her brought against them

397
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,600
they paid 10 million bucks because that that's how it happens there is absolute payola you know you'll

398
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:41,720
have to go and suck some you know what over at the BET and MTV and VH1 and any other music

399
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,880
channel video channel you have to make your own video you'll have to pay for it I think it's freaking

400
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:53,880
worth it by the way I really am waiting for the first video blogger is that my phone going off

401
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:01,160
on a second let me just check shoot it was wrong I'll get back to later I think that there will be a

402
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,720
collaboration very soon between a one or more pod save music artist and video bloggers who will you

403
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,840
start to work with the art and the skills that they're honing right now and create fantastic music

404
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,920
videos that will be able to enjoy online there's plenty of communities that trade music videos watch them

405
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:29,320
I'm really expecting some some big things from it tomorrow got a pack get ready to go it's

406
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,640
going to be a fun weekend San Francisco we have our company Christmas party the first one and it's

407
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,920
going to be in the new office is like could not be more excited I don't have a lot of hair I just

408
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,040
like what for my course and let you know that I think you're great as I know that a lot of heat

409
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,520
for the same things that is on truth it's the shame because I think everyone makes mistakes on

410
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:57,080
the internet I do mostly things I think everyone's changed a bit about some of the websites I go

411
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:02,920
so let's look on the right side this is not facing a firing squad of Vietnam this Christmas

412
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,960
anyway here I want to talk about anything then just remember I only let 42 and half minutes

413
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,000
walk from your house and that you are welcome to the home but nice to now Roger do you hear what he said

414
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,000
let me just make sure I heard that correctly did he say he only lives 42 minutes from my house

415
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,680
this is starting to get frightening I'll have a second let me listen to that I can

416
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,280
I don't have any Roger here I'm just a bit about some of the websites I go to but look on the

417
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:40,280
right side this is not facing a firing squad of Vietnam this Christmas is that a Gary glitter reference

418
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,280
what the hell is that you're not facing a firing squad in Vietnam this Christmas

419
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,800
anyway here I want to talk about anything then just remember I only let 42 and half minutes walk

420
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,760
from your house and that you are welcome to the home but nice to now Roger

421
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:08,120

00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:34,520
miss out but I got you baby don't I'm your snowman baby right on plenty of holiday music at the

445
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,640
pot safe music network and of course I continue to update the xmus.podshow.com podcast

446
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,440
to Christmas songs back to back with holiday greetings from podcasters and podsafe

447
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,840
music artists alike playboys coming out with something called the podcast which will be

448
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:58,920
basically a video podcast targeted specifically at video iPods and Sony PSP PSP's

449
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:08,760
with pictures and videos of negative women you can just wait for the parent groups to get

450
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,880
up in arms over that the perfect it's the gift that keeps on giving the perfect Christmas gift

451
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,040
that's going to be interesting thanks for all the tattoo ideas they keep to they keep

452
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,560
streaming in and it's starting to look better and better and wouldn't it be weird if I

453
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,640
actually wound up getting a tattoo that someone I don't even know other than a listener through

454
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,640
the internet and maybe some email conversation that drew that that would be pretty interesting

455
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:38,520
send more Dr. John says my specific suggestion is to record yourself saying something like

456
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,720
freedom free media or even sent sale then take a screenshot of it take it to your tattoo

457
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,960
artists and hit it that way you could make it something really personal to yourself what is

458
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:56,600
talking about here oh man he's got a really complicated idea about the audacity icon

459
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,720
oh we think maybe should use a waveform I get it oh okay that's pretty interesting so I could

460
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,160
have wings and then in the middle would be would be a waveform of something that it wouldn't

461
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,880
that be funny then everyone could look at my arms start comparing to find out what what the waveform

462
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,480
actually represents if you took a picture of it maybe you could recreate it that's an interesting

463
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,240
idea Dr. John I like that okay that's cool waveform I think I think we'll go on here I think

464
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,840
there's something happen waveform in the middle and then nice pilot's wings on the outside that's cool

465
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:38,760
one more brief item about soundvertising Jim said we've come full circle dude belching makes us

466
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,480
think of senseo seeing senseo adds makes us think of the daily source code seeing the senseo

467
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,120
itself makes me belch will drinking senseo make us listen to the daily source code well yeah that's

468
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,720
