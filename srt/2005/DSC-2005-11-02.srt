00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Geltis Yara Charley 2-7-2

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There are no secrets.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Only information you don't yet have.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now I'm Korean.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
16 dollars worth of silk box are shorts wedged in my ass.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And so much sense say it's coming out my ears.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We don't need lost digging prison.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I like to think I'm flying into the toilet.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm just taking this battle curry.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
November 2, 2005.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome to the daily source code coming to you from Curry Cottage.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And Gilford Suri, I'm in a bad mood.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And it's the bitch cast.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Good morning.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I lost lost the first one by all the tips.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Good job.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We can speak to Trump to fight some bitch out.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We can all day.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Some say they put on tin.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Look up the pen and put it in the neck and stuff with the right now.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I see feminine mowers.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I see him continue to win.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She's on top of my field of pain.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But what's funny?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They're waiting.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And y'all never bless us again.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Jumping.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There's him.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go back.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Jumping.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jumping.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Go back.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Jumping.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Jumping.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Go back.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Jumping.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Jumping.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Go back.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Go back.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Go.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Go back.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Go back.

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Go back.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go back.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Go back.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Go back.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Go.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Aether.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Go back.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:18,000
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:48,000
, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,020
one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, another, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, two, one, one, one, one, one, one, the only one, one, two, one, one, one, one, one,, one, one, one, one, one, two, three, one, it won't come under the heart, the whole, it won't come under, so, and one, this, good, have the word, be well.

53
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,020
I'm gonna spin for it's up

54
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,020
Hopefully it won't be at the championship

55
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
I can't stop it

56
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,020
It can't help so well

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,020
And I know I'm not far away

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,020
It can't have all the games I know

59
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
This is the biggest thing

60
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,020
The problem is you've been there

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Hold on, you won't mess

62
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,020
Bring us a night dance

63
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
The problem is you've been there

64
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,020
Hold on, you won't mess

65
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,020
Oh, it leaves my load

66
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,020
The breeze can draw a population

67
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,020
The river might have been there

68
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,020
And I don't mean no big hits now

69
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,020
But for you to go

70
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,020
I'll go so far

71
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,020
Dream of Galliford and Kesha

72
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Dream of Galliford and Kesha

73
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Dream of Galliford and Kesha

74
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,020
Dream of Galliford and Kesha

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,020
Yeah

76
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
We're gonna spin it with some full time

77
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
You let them over

78
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
No, we saw some full

79
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Better spin it

80
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
I'll make our money

81
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,020
When time's the press

82
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,020
I knew something was wrong with that

83
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Witness the foreign occasion

84
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Witness the problems with technology

85
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
It's just looking at the time

86
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,020
I'm like, huh?

87
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,020
They started a whole new verse there

88
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
And I knew it only had three seconds left

89
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Okay

90
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,020
I've got to medicate myself

91
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,020
It's not been a good day

92
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,020
I just was reading an email

93
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,020
This is amazing

94
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,020
Everything's been going wrong technically today

95
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
It's pissing rain outside

96
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,020
I've got nothing but angry podcasters

97
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Some of which I'll actually play for you on this show

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,020
I've got a ground loop hum

99
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,020
Somewhere that I can't get rid of

100
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,020
And then I look at my emails

101
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,020
I'm during that mashup

102
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,020
And I'm getting ready to pull up my source code emails

103
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,020
And I see my tax lawyer saying

104
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,020
You know, something about taxes

105
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,020
And 11,000 euros

106
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,020
And like, oh my, which, you know, it's like

107
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
130,000 dollars

108
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
And like, what?

109
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
Oh yeah, great

110
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
Then I get a fucking excuse me

111
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,020
There will be plenty of bad language in today's show

112
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,020
Not that I can really help

113
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,020
But it just kind of comes out

114
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,020
Okay, so it turns out that I'm actually getting that

115
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
That's a tax refund

116
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,020
But still, I'm pissing about

117
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
It's, you know, screw money

118
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,020
I'm pissing about all kinds of stuff today

119
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Let me see, let me just tell you what

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,020
It's about this house that we have, the cottage

121
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,020
It's, it's picturesque

122
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,020
It's beautiful

123
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,020
The location is almost fantastic

124
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
We love the town

125
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
Everything is great

126
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,020
It's not quite big enough for us

127
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,020
But that's okay, I mean, it's great

128
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,020
But it's an old house

129
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,020
And the shit's falling apart

130
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,020
I can, I understand

131
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Patricia's frustration

132
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
She keeps telling me you want me

133
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
This guy's coming on

134
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
And we got that guy

135
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
We're pairing this, we're pairing that

136
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,020
And, you know, the landlord was so nice

137
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,020
Not to raise our rent this year

138
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Because of all the troubles we've had

139
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,020
I'm sorry, it's just not cut and I want to

140
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,020
Frick and

141
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,020
Reduction next time

142
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,020
So today we had the painter

143
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,020
Painter, painting up the

144
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,020
The spots that the boiler

145
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,020
Created in the ceiling

146
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,020
Because that was leaking

147
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,020
And, and these are all nice guys

148
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
By the way, and then the electrician

149
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,020
And then the heating doesn't

150
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,020
Just, it's just one thing after another

151
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,020
And this is not a chief house

152
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,020
It's not cheap

153
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Oh, yeah, it's Wednesday

154
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,020
It is the daily source code

155
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,020
And we got plenty to complain, you know, there's another thing

156
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,020
So Patricia loves to call her mom

157
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
And her dad and her sister

158
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
And they're all live in the Netherlands

159
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
And calling Holland

160
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
It's one of the most expensive countries in the world

161
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,020
And you know, there's some kind of monopoly

162
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,020
Going on there and it's messed up

163
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,020
And the prices are not at all in line with the European Union

164
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,020
And they like the gab, you know

165
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,020
They like to talk a lot

166
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,020
Now her parents don't have a computer

167
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
And don't have broadband

168
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
So, you know, all the obvious things

169
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,020
That you would email me about a got it

170
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,020
Now that's, unfortunately

171
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,020
We don't have that kind of set up with them

172
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,020
But I got a wonderful Skype out

173
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,020
Account for her for Patricia

174
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,020
And I got one of those cordless USB phones

175
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,020
So for her, it's just like a phone, you know

176
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
It's great, you can walk around, use it like a phone

177
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
And she's very, very patient

178
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
Because this thing breaks so often, you know

179
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,020
And then of course it's on

180
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,020
It has to be on the Windows computer

181
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Is there a cordless phone for a Mac please

182
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,020
Please tell me there's a cordless phone for Skype

183
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
For Mac

184
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,020
If not, someone

185
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
There's a market here, it's, you know

186
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
Because the Windows ship, man

187
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,020
Then you plug in, Christina plugs in her webcam

188
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,020
And then that captures all the devices

189
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,020
And then the phone won't work

190
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
And then at the end of the day

191
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
After I've trouble shot everything

192
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Creating new accounts on the Windows machine

193
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
To log in then

194
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,020
It turns out the Skype out balance is toast

195
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,020
You know, and I don't like that

196
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,020
There's a great set of warning lights that goes off

197
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,020
Or a way to auto renew or anything

198
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Smart like that

199
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,020
And believe me, now that Skype has been purchased by eBay

200
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,020
And I got an email from a guy who works very close with the development team

201
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,020
And I can tell you who it is

202
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
And I want to embarrass him

203
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,020
But there's no more development going on

204
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Maybe it'll pick up again

205
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,020
But right now that company is completely influx

206
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
And then so check this

207
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
Doesn't eBay own PayPal

208
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Because that's how I pay for the Skype out account

209
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Every single time you go from Skype

210
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,020
From their upgrade your Skype out account

211
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,020
To the PayPal page

212
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,020
You get the reset your password

213
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,020
And have to reset my password

214
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Every single time

215
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
And I reset it to the same thing

216
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,020
And there's no warning about that

217
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,020
Same warning that you've already used this password

218
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,020
Yeah

219
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
It's stupid

220
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,020
It's stupid

221
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Oh, hide that shit from

222
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
And Windows in general

223
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,020
What is wrong with this

224
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,020
God, I hate it

225
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,020
I just, I really am not sorry

226
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,020
I'm emotional about this stuff

227
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
I hate Windows

228
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Live update

229
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
And critical update

230
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,020
And rebooting your computer

231
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,020
Stop it

232
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Oh

233
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
It looks like this

234
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Windows live stuff might be interesting

235
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,020
So you get all the benefits of

236
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,020
Microsoft Office through web browser

237
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,020
I could deal with that

238
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
That would be good

239
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
I don't know about that

240
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,020
I mean I'm going to be pretty loyal

241
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
To Gmail

242
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
But some of that other stuff

243
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
Pretty good

244
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
It looked like they had an interesting homepage

245
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,020
And the search and stuff

246
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,020
A lot of blogging going on about it

247
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,020
I'm not quite sure what it is

248
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,020
It seems like it might be a suite of stuff

249
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
That you can access over the web

250
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Well, that's good

251
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
I'm all for that

252
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
Then it won't matter what kind of computer you have

253
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
That's yeah

254
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
That'll definitely do it

255
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Okay

256
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
So weather today is

257
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
Crapola

258
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,020
It's been raining

259
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,020
Really not nice at all

260
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Patricia's downstairs

261
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Finally I think everyone's gone

262
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,020
It's two o'clock

263
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,020
It's much later than usual to record today's show

264
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,020
And I have, as I said, morning

265
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
I've got some more bitchiness coming up

266
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
Not for myself

267
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,020
But in the form of one of my fellow pod squatters

268
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
We'll get to that in a second

269
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
And plenty of email

270
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
Let's see

271
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,020
What should we get to first

272
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,020
Luke Renault

273
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Says

274
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Would you be so kind to stop using the ping sound

275
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
At the end of the daily source code

276
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,020
I use Gmail Notifier

277
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
Whenever I hear that sound

278
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
My brain tells me that I have an email

279
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
So I rush off to mail and check it

280
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
In spite of the fact that

281
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,020
No growl alert box has appeared

282
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,020
Well, you know that's interesting

283
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
That is I kind of like that at the end

284
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Because that's

285
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,020
The Chimoo timer is what that is

286
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,020
Find Mac OS X

287
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
OS X

288
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Sorry

289
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Got so many emails about

290
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
I'm not allowed to say OS X

291
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
I have to say OS X

292
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,020
I'm letting it all hang out today

293
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
My friends

294
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
And it back times

295
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Because I like to set a timer now

296
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,020
And kind of back time to see where the hell I am

297
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,020
And it seems like kind of 50-50 on yesterday's show

298
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
People

299
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,020
Everyone liked it with a lot of the pod

300
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,020
Say music

301
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
A lot of we're afraid to say

302
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,020
You're not going to move to this format full-time

303
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,020
Are you?

304
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,020
No, no, no, no, not at all

305
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
Just didn't have a lot to say yesterday

306
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,020
So why give you a whole bunch of diary of the mouth

307
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
When there was a lot of cool tunes

308
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
The share

309
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,020
And maybe you didn't like all the tunes

310
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020
About mashups

311
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,020
Here's another thing I received tons of email about

312
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
Okay, bottom line

313
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
No, it's not legal

314
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,020
It is completely illegal to play

315
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,020
Any form of licensed music in a podcast

316
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,020
I mean now that there's jurisprudence over this

317
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,020
But common sense tells you that

318
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,020
Why do I do it?

319
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
Why do I do it?

320
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
Because it's art

321
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
It's beautiful art

322
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
It's not a commercial art form

323
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
It's people taking

324
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,020
Other is derivative artworks

325
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,020
It's a beautiful thing

326
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
We can never get it licensed

327
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,020
And I'll play it until someone tells me

328
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
I really can't

329
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,020
And no matter what defense you put up

330
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,020
You can't win against a big lawyer

331
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
Stuff

332
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
I'm reading this book

333
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
Or actually I should say I'm not reading it

334
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
Let me get it

335
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,020
To my iPod

336
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,020
I heard a

337
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
Let's see

338
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
Was it a podcast?

339
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
Yeah, I think I'm not quite sure

340
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,020
It was maybe it was on the media

341
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
That I heard about this guy

342
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,020
I already heard about the book

343
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,020
Let me see if I can just go back here

344
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,020
And go to my audiobooks

345
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
I want to get the title exactly right

346
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Yeah, the future of music

347
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
Unabridged

348
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,020
By Dave Cusack and

349
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
Gird something

350
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
The iPod's not scrolling

351
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
Let me see

352
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,020
The future of music

353
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,020
Manif

354
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
It says

355
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
Dave Cusack

356
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
And Gird wool dot dot dot

357
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
Okay, so I can't tell what that is

358
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
That's unfortunate

359
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Anyway

360
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
Very interesting

361
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Let me see

362
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,020
Is it playing now?

363
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Is it stopped?

364
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,020
No, stop, please.

365
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
There we go

366
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,020
He made this guy makes a lot of really valid points

367
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,020
About the music business

368
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,020
And he specifically said in this interview

369
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,020
And I'm pretty sure it was on the media

370
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
He said

371
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
If he's

372
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,020
Predicting the full collapse of the music business

373
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,020
The commercial music business within

374
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,020
12 to 18 months

375
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
I kind of sign up to that

376
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,020
That there's already been a real collapse

377
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,020
And he says, look at what's happening

378
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,020
The music business is letting themselves become irrelevant

379
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,020
Because the numbers of people listening to podcasts

380
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,020
And interested in

381
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,020
In music that can be shuffled around and shared

382
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,020
freely and used in other forms of media

383
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,020
Are making their one and a half million songs

384
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,020
Which is all the music services have to offer

385
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,020
Which is all that apparently is valuable

386
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,020
And in music in the world

387
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
One and a half million songs

388
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
That's it

389
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,020
They're becoming irrelevant

390
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,020
And it's absolutely true

391
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,020
And it's only because they can't figure out

392
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
How to license this stuff

393
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
I mean how many times we said we'd be willing to pay

394
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,020
To play it on a podcast

395
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
He greedy

396
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
That's what you are

397
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,020
That's why it's not going to work

398
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,020
And that's why we had the pod save

399
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
Music network

400
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
Which I'm sure we're talking about a lot today

401
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,020
All right, let me shut up for a second

402
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,020
Hey out there in podcast land

403
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,020
My name's Chris and I do a show called Allcast

404
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,020
Out of Vancouver British Columbia in Canada

405
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Basically in my show is about

406
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Anything and everything that's going on in my life

407
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
And then the world around me

408
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
It's basically a mishmash of me talking about

409
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,020
News, TV, movies, music, comic books, books

410
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
And well, tell anything

411
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,020
I play a lot of pod save easing on the show

412
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
And I do a special spotlight every show

413
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
On local Vancouver artists

414
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,020
That are trying to break into the industry

415
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,020
So if you like hearing someone

416
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,020
You have to book things in the world

417
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
And you like good music

418
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Check out Allcast

So here's an email

422
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,020
Which was titled Living Like The Flintstones

423
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,020
Thanks to Wilma from

424
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Jeffery says Jeff, this is Adam, this is Jeff the podcast listener

425
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Who is the guest on podcast four and one's 100th show

426
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,020
Found a cut up on Delta Sierra Charlie

427
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,020
Using Wi-Fi at a local Panera Bread

428
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,020
They got their power back

429
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,020
I live in broad

430
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Broad County, Florida

431
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,020
Where we were hit dead on by wicked Wilma

432
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,020
That was on Monday, October 24th

433
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
Listen, please

434
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,020
Because I'm pissy about a lot of things

435
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,020
Today and we got some pissiness on the way

436
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,020
But it pails in comparison to what is happening

437
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,020
And I'm amazed that I have to hear about this through email

438
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,020
And it's not on television

439
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,020
Because you'd expect it to be there

440
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,020
So Florida was hit dead on by wicked Wilma

441
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,020
That was October, Monday, October 24th

442
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
We still do not have power phones

443
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Or running water where I live

444
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,020
And no power or phones at my office

445
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,020
Schools were closed all last week

446
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
And this week

447
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,020
Your analysis of life without power

448
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
And your apology to Pida

449
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Barely scratches the surface

450
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
Suffice to say it blows

451
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,020
Her cane pun intended

452
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,020
And he goes on to say about

453
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
What kind of

454
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,020
What kind of damage

455
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
And this is really, this is really horrible

456
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
Personally, I experienced extensive damage

457
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
So my property lost in beautiful old trees

458
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,020
A deck, ironing fence, storage shed

459
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
My son's half-pipe skateboard rampy built

460
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
That sucks, that bites ass

461
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
As well as some leaks and roof damage

462
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
From trees falling on our house

463
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,020
Also lost an old sailboat that was washed up

464
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,020
On the rocks and destroyed where

465
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,020
It was kept in coconut grove

466
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,020
First few days we literally bathed in a lake survivor style

467
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,020
And cooked hot meals and cans on a sterno

468
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,020
This is really, really, really messed up

469
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
What can we do, Jeff?

470
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Besides, you know, send money to hurricane relief

471
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Shit man, we should go, I mean, that's horrible

472
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
That is horrible

473
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
So it's been over a week now

474
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
Right, 24 plus seven

475
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,020
So it's been eight days

476
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,020
And I wonder if they have power back or phones

477
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,020
And all we see is that fricking fat jerk Al-Roker

478
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,020
Falling on his face, which of course gave me some pleasure

479
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,020
I said, I mentioned this the other day

480
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,020
I met him a couple times, professionally

481
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Working together on stuff

482
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
He's a dick

483
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Oh, self-serving

484
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
You know, I sound a bit like mad

485
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Hmm, should I be concerned

486
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,020
Hello Adam Madge here

487
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
What's again, you've managed to piss me off

488
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,020
To the point where I have to comment on your goddamn show

489
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,020
First of all, you're keeping bitching about how

490
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,020
you can say you won't pay you to advertise

491
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Why the fuck should they pay you to

492
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,020
Sponsor to be a sponsor

493
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
When you're doing it for fucking free

494
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
Every goddamn day with your goddamn

495
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Sincere bullshit

496
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,020
You know, if they're not sponsoring your show

497
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,020
Then don't fucking mention them every five seconds

498
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Because why the fuck would I pay you

499
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,020
To advertise when you're doing it for fucking free

500
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
Every goddamn day

501
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Enough about it

502
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
And the coffee's not even good anyway

503
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
It's goddamn nasty

504
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,020
But you know, I drink it because it's fast

505
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,020
That's the only reason to drink the shit

506
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,020
Because it's a notch up from instant coffee

507
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,020
And all those people that call him and say

508
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,020
Hmm, Sincere, they're just full of shit

509
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,020
Give me a goddamn break

510
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Anyway, the second thing is

511
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,020
Give me a fucking eye dog too

512
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Huh?

513
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
What lesbians don't get toys?

514
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,020
Bye Adam

515
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,020
And from the bloated Jewish lesbians

516
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,020
We go to the bearded lady of Gilbert

517
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Hey baby

518
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,020
And the biggest lesbian

519
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,020
Excuse me

520
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,020
You got to talk into that mic

521
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
It sounds like shit

522
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,020
Really?

523
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
Yeah, I don't know what it is

524
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
So sit in this

525
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,020
It sounds like

526
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
Sounds like it is a waterfall behind it

527
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,020
People have been asking about you on the show, huh?

528
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
Oh?

529
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
Yeah, they want to hear you on the show

530
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,020
They love you

531
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Of course they miss you

532
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
Well, that's nice

533
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,020
Yeah

534
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,020
That's nice to hear

535
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
Yeah

536
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
They want us to do another one of those music shows

537
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,020
Oh really?

538
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,020
Yeah, where you critique the music

539
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
Oh boy

540
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,020
How they like that?

541
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,020
Come on

542
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
It was alright, it was good

543
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
Yeah, I'm nice

544
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,020
Hmm

545
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
You know, I know how it is

546
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,020
I know how it feels

547
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
What?

548
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,020
Well, if somebody, you know, says something about your music

549
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
I know that

550
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,020
Yeah, I have to like, I can't see you

551
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
I can see you

552
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
I can see you

553
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,020
Behind this big grey thing

554
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,020
It's not just a big grey thing

555
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,020
It's the podcast complex

556
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
I know

557
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
I know

558
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
I've been there

559
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Oh, this sounds like shit

560
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
I got to fix that

561
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,020
So I was just, today is the

562
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
Bitch cast

563
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
I'm complaining about the house

564
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
I'm about Skype

565
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
And about

566
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
Yeah

567
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
I just bitched about it

568
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
To my mom

569
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,020
And she said, no, it's a lovely house

570
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,020
It's a lovely house

571
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,020
Yeah, but it's falling apart

572
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Yeah

573
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,020
And it's not, well, and that's one thing

574
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,020
But you know, we're paying real money to this

575
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Yeah

576
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,020
Yeah, a lot of money

577
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,020
Sox

578
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Yeah, I know

579
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Well, that's why we said we're never gonna

580
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020
We never gonna buy

581
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,020
Or rent an old house again

582
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
No, not after this

583
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
We've been in a lot of, you know,

584
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,020
All the whole

585
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
Historical

586
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
Historical

587
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,020
Yeah

588
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,020
With historical charm

589
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
Shit falling off

590
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,020
Yeah

591
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,020
Who?

592
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,020
The one in Belgium was 1880

593
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,020
And the one

594
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,020
That house was well put together actually

595
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
Yeah, but that

596
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Yeah, but that had been completely

597
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
Remodeled

598
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
So that was actually good

599
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,020
I got it

600
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
Everything was new

601
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,020
But when, when should happen there

602
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
I was really expensive

603
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
Yeah

604
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
Whenever something like that

605
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Open up walls

606
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Do you remember

607
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
When

608
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,020
When all the

609
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,020
All the toilet plumbing blew up

610
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Underneath the house

611
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,020
Oh man

612
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Because

613
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,020
Because you

614
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
Would empty out the cat box

615
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,020
Into the toilet

616
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Well, not you wouldn't empty out the cat box

617
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Did you do that in that house too?

618
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
Yeah, because what you do is

619
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
If the cat would do a dumb thing

620
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
You'd get your little, little shovel

621
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
And pick up your scoop

622
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,020
And throw it into the toilet

623
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,020
And then you flush it

624
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
You know, little stone

625
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
A kitty lay there

626
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,020
Stone

627
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,020
Right

628
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
Pick to that to the pool

629
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Yeah, right

630
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
And those would all sit in the bottom of the pipe

631
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
And I thought you know

632
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,020
It will nice and clean out the pipes

633
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
Yeah, well, I did the opposite

634
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
Did not

635
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,020
But do you remember

636
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
What I did in America

637
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
The pickles

638
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
Because you

639
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Thinking it's the same

640
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
It's the same size

641
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
I'm same shape

642
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020
The only is not made of mush

643
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
It's not made of poop

644
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,020
That would be the difference

645
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,020
And it was totally blocked and blocked

646
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
But I liked the thinking

647
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
That it's the same shape

648
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,020
Yeah, that's what I said

649
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
To the plumber

650
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
The plumber said

651
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,020
Why did you put pickles

652
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
I said, I want to

653
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
You know, I was a jar of old pickles

654
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
And I thought I'd throw it away

655
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
Don't want to see it anymore

656
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
And

657
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
You know

658
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
Why not that?

659
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,020
Oh man

660
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
Yeah

661
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
Okay, I'm going to place some

662
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
Magis pissed off

663
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,020
It's Steve Jobs

664
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,020
Oh yeah

665
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
Yeah, I was listening to

666
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Magis Weinstein yesterday

667
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
And

668
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Magis really really really pissed off

669
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Oh

670
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
Because you know how on iTunes on the

671
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020

Hot and happen and whatever

And he says there's never

Ever ever ever ever been

676
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Yeah, never been a gay

Or lesbian podcast

678
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,020
Featured on the on the homepage

679
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,020
On purpose, you think?

680
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,020
I don't know

681
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Well, yeah, you want to listen

682
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,020
You want to hear this?

683
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,020
Yeah

684
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,020
I don't have another pair of heads

685
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Oh, shit

686
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
I'm not prepared

687
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
No, it's okay, it's okay

688
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
Everything you can't hear

689
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,020
No, it's a whole thing

690
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
I'll hear it later

691
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
But I believe you

692
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
Oh, let's play it

693
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,020
Hey, hun, thanks for coming on the show

694
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,020
You're welcome

695
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
I live here, you know

696
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,020
Oh, that's right

697
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Yes

698
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
Sorry

699
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
This is from the spec

700
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,020
It's a section being featured on the iTunes homepage

701
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,020
Right

702
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
And iTunes

703
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
We're constantly on the lookout for podcasts that are

704
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Breaking new ground at this medium

705
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Oh, oh

706
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
Have new and unusual contents

707
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
Or just capture our interest

708
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
When do we find them?

709
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
We like to feature them on the podcast homepage

710
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,020
Well, there are no sure if I

711
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
A ways to get your podcast featured

712
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,020
And no, we do not accept payments for promotion

713
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,020
Yeah, right

714
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
There are some minimum requirements

715
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,020
To be featured by iTunes podcasts

716
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Must have colon

717
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
M

718
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
One in image for image specs

719
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
See the iTunes RSS tags section below

720
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Two

721
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
I robust an accurate description

722
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Three a proper language category

723
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,020
An explicit tagging

724
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,020
And I would add

725
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
General audience

726
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,020
I would add four

727
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,020
A profound and disgustingly

728
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Overt heterosexual message

729
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Because if you're gay

730
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,020
We won't feature you on this shit

731
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
And that is bullshit

732
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,020
Have you ever

733
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,020
Ever

734
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,020
Seeing a cue product

735
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,020
A queer kiss

736
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
And there are close to 200

737
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Now we're close to 200 I think

738
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Yeah

739
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
200 podcasts

740
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
Or maybe it's 150

741
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I don't fucking know

742
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
But it's definitely over 100

743
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
And

744
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
And

745
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,020
Have you ever seen one of them?

746
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
One of them

747
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Featured on iTunes

748
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,020
Even though our pod shows are some of the most entertaining

749
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,020
The most creative

750
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,020
And the most popular shows

751
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
We've got

752
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,020
You know, of course

753
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Fox and the city

754
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
We've got the wander wisdom

755
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,020
We've got the Patrick

756
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,020
Noah show

757
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,020
We've got John on

758
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,020
All these

759
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,020
There's too many to mention

760
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
The archer radio

761
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
And everything like this

762
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,020
And there's so much

763
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,020
Out there

764
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
There's something for everything

765
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
We've got lesbians

766
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,020
Now with the lesbian soup

767
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,020
The crash and belly

768
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,020
So much entertaining stuff

769
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
Political stuff

770
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
Engaging

771
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
Intertaining stuff

772
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,020
And none of us have ever been featured on the iTunes homepage

773
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
And I think it's because we're gay

774
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
And I'm sick of it

775
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
And when iTunes first came out

776
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
And we bitched because there's no gay and lesbian category

777
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
Listen

778
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,020
We don't have any rights in this country

779
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
The least you can do is give us a fucking category

780
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
And god damn iTunes

781
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,020
Fucking Steve Jobs

782
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,020
You need to learn how to god damn dress

783
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Yeah

784
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Maybe you'll listen to some gay podcast

785
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
You learn how to not wear a god damn butt

786
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
Turtle neck

787
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,020
And jeans

788
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
All the way up to your vagina

789
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,020
Every god damn time you do a gay note

790
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
Leave your shirt on

791
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,020
Talk to asshole

792
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,020
Why does every fucking heterosexual

793
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,020
And we're a god damn cell phone on his belt

794
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
I've got damn sick of it

795
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,020
I am god damn sick of it

796
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,020
Oh man

797
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Oh man the whole show is like this by the way

798
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
I've all the luggage on the waist

799
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,020
I am so fucking sick of it

800
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,020
Take your shirt, add your pants

801
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
Stop tucking in your goddamn shirt

802
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
And put it all that shit on your belt

803
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
It's god damn annoying and stupid

804
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
And I'm taking my shirt out right now

805
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,020
And all it does is say I'm a heterosexual jerk

806
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Who's only purpose in life is to get buzzed around by my wife

807
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,020
And repro fucking doce

808
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
So stop it already

809
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
I'm so fucking pissed at you fucking

810
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,020
Steve Jobs

811
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,020
Fuck you

812
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Yeah right

813
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,020
I can say that

814
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
You know why because I spend all this god damn money on you shit

815
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
All these q-pots do

816
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,020
At least a third of your customers are god damn thugs and dikes

817
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
The least you can do is give us a fucking category

818
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,020
And feature one of our shows once in a goddamn while

819
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Hello

820
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Oh and by the way

821
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Don't think you're off the hook if I'm not talking about you yet

822
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Because you're on the list

823
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
Speaking of podcast for one one

824
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,020
Why don't you ever

825
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
Talk about gay podcast and held

826
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
How about you podcast Ali

827
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
What about you

828
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
Huh

829
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,020
You got people like Reagan Fox who every fucking month is begging people

830
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:43,020
The go to that goddamn site he was promoting the shit out of that goddamn site go to vote for me vote for me

831
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:51,020
Vote for me never once have we had a gay and or less be in podcast featured on podcast Ali either

832
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:59,020
So what's going on why this why this sort of subtle yet unspoken home of fuck god today over modular home of phobia on

833
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,020
And the iTunes

834
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:17,020
Oh man, I was laughing. I had a laugh again when I hear that you know I guess it's true you know Madge Weinstein certainly a podcast pioneer there from the early days good times everybody and

835
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:23,020
And I like it when when magic is really angry because that's when she really focuses in on our targets, man

836
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:32,020
You know this show and also East radio our broadcast every weekday on serious satellite radio stars 103 channel 103

837
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:37,020
channel 103 which is right next to the Howard Stern channels. He is two channels. I think and

838
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:44,020
You know, so people tuning in who who love lesbians which is a lot of Howard's appeal

839
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:54,020
Yeah, switch over to our channel once in a while. We've got lesbians of the bloated Jewish and very angry variety

840
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Aloha in the house it. This is pico for the Hawaiian concert guide at Hawaiian concert guide calm

841
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:14,020
We featured the most excellent artists of the Hawaiian islands as they perform off island around the mainland

842
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:24,020
If you've ever been curious about the uniquely Hawaiian art form then this is the place to be we feature an index of the artists their schedule

843
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Performances with links to their albums take a good look and a good listen. You'll be glad you did

844
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:36,020
Mahalo and Ahui Ho this is pico for the Hawaiian concert guide

845
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,020
Yeah, Mahalo my Hawaiian concert guide dot com. I got to go to Hawaii again

846
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:48,020
Boy, I love going up there when they're with MTV one time to cover like a skateboard competition or something. We were baked with it

847
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
right now

848
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,020
Oh, remind me

849
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:59,020
Right after this next positive tune that I'm going to roll out front row, which is the name of the software that the new iMacs

850
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,020
Come bundled with it gives that so called ten foot enter interface with the remote control

851
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:11,020
So yesterday did a kind of like a shout out saying does anyone gotten that running on any other computer other than a G5 iMac

852
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,020
And oh, I got such an onslaught of email with even with some attachments, which was really really cool

853
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:22,020
So I've got it running on every single computer in my house now and I can even use it with a different kind of remote control

854
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,020
Which I'll be happy to tell you about

855
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,020
After this one from the pod save music network founded on the homepage today, the miss fits

856
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,020
Here's imperfect harmony

857
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
Who are these people?

858
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,020
I hear a lot of good people from me

859
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,020
I hear my living address, my personality

860
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,020
They come out when I'm least in space

861
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,020
People think I'm out of there

862
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,020
I see my face when you first I can't breathe out from the wall

863
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,020
My friends

864
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,020
And me

865
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:02,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

866
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,020
And I am in the wind stream

867
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:13,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

868
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

869
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

870
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

We're left together and in the weeks of our name

872

We're left together and in the weeks of our name

873
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

874
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

875
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

876
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

877
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

878
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

879
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

881
00:29:53,020 --> 00:30:03,020
We're left together and in the weeks of our name

00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,020
We're left together and in the week of our name

883
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:13,020
We left together in the next five

884
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:19,020
We left together in the next five

885
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:25,020
We left together in the next five

886
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:31,020
We left together in the next five

We left together in the next five

888
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,020
We left together in the next five

889
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:47,020
We left together in the next five

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:53,020
We left together in the next five

891
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,020
We left together in the next six

892
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:07,020
We left together we left together in the next five

893
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:37,020
We lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together and we lived together

894
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:51,820
All right you're probably sitting there yelling at your MP3 player

895
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:59,580
going it's not the miss fits not that it can't be you right miss prints with the Z at the end prints the miss prints

896
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,620
In perfect harmony from the podcast music network music dot pod show dot com couple more comments coming up about

897
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:14,140
the positive music network, but first about front to row which is this apple OS X application

898
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,580
So there's now a hacked version out on the net that's flown around because I guess if you start some hardware

899
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:28,220
That doesn't isn't compatible or I guess it just says it's I'm not a I'm not a G5 I Mac then

900
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:35,660
It won't fire up so someone's hacked the application and you can basically run front row and here's what's really cool

901
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,780
Because of course if you don't have the remote control it kind of loses some of the appeal

902
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,740
But you can hook it up to the

903
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:52,700
salient is salient. It's the salient clicker, which is a Bluetooth application that will allow you to fire apple script

904
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,260
So I

905
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,940
Yeah, so it fires off apple scripts and then you can basically use yourself on cool is that I love it

906
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,740
Very very cool hack. Thank you all so much for and you could just google it. You'll find it

907
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,740
There's a whole bunch of places

908
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,740
We can pick that up and and just the fact and I think that I'm actually gonna set up the clicker stuff

909
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,420
Back at the at the condo so I can operate it with my cell phone as well

910
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,980
I don't always have that remote control around but I certainly do

911
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,980
Have my my blackberry. Oh, it might not work with a blackberry. It has like limited lame-o

912
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,420
Bluetooth support. Oh, yesterday by the way. We went

913
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,620
We went and looked at a diesel. Oh, yeah, so what we're looking at is the

914
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,420
Jaguar S type

915
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,260
I can hear Run Bloom laughing very loudly right now

916
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,940
His wife Marta has an S type and I've berated that car over and over again because

917
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,300
It has a dashboard panel that looks like it's a Ford and of course that is a Ford dash

918
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,420
You know, it's basically the the climate control thing. It's a ugly ugly green LCD screen

919
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,660
To show you how high your fan is or whatever

920
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,660
So they have a new version which has like one big console and it's a touch screen and it has a

921
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,740
As they call a sat nav here or a navigator or GPS navigator

922
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,300
But it all it's also your interface to all the car control so it doesn't look as 40 on the inside and you can get it in some pretty cool

923
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,660
Versions now, you know, I like the wood on the inside that gives that real Jaguar feel and

924
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:36,060
And it comes in a six liter 2.7 turbo diesel double turbo diesel

925
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:44,540
Rails thing ruby on rails whatever the hell it is and and producers I think like 250 horsepower

926
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,780
Something like that well, maybe 240 but it's but the that's the brake horsepower

927
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,420
But the torque is it has more torque than the 4.2 liter

928
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,900
Engine the regular petrol engine so I guess the question is

929
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,380
Does anyone have any experience or have any suggestions or ideas about filling that puppy up with biodiesel?

930
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,380
I asked the the sales guy and he went

931
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,940
No, no, we don't really do

932
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,220
Biodiesel engines and he didn't know what the fuck was talking about basically

933
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,940
So I just skipped that I wasn't interested

934
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,780
I just wanted to hear about what price I could get on the car. They're not cheap, but the car, man

935
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,380
It they are kind of nice. It's so it's not too big. It's much smaller

936
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,740
Less powerful than Studio A8 but we you know if you when you said how many miles you think it'd be driving with this car?

937
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
You know like a thousand a year

938
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,740
Really not more than that

939
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,860
So a couple people have seen a sense say oh add

940
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,740
On television here's what's cool and this match is probably one of the reasons why I

941
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,180
Keep talking about it besides the fact that I do like the coffee

942
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:52,220
Now when people see a sense say oh add on television. They think oh daily source code hey now that's a free bit of publicity

943
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,220
Huh like that

944
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,100
And then Christopher Penn writes in and says part of the soundvertizing fell flat for me

945
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Certainly with a logic tech MM 50

946
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,300
He feels it's a really lame product name. It says nothing and when you enunciate it on the show

947
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,100
It sounds about as compelling as reading entries from the phone more

948
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:16,380
Compare how you enunciate the sense say oh name in the original soundvertize soundvertizing experiment with the MM 50 promotion

949
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,580
That's true MM 50 is a little harder to anchor into your mind

950
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,780
Goes on say MM 50 means nothing could be a part of a jet engine to speak or system a deld a door dildo no one knows

951
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,980
Why do you want to make a suggestion to your partners a logic tech to come up with a stylish name that sounds good

952
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:37,180
Why do tech is an unfamiliar with stylish naming thing that denobo keyboard system had a very slick name

953
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,220
They they could play up for that audio novo or pod novo or something like that. No, that's pretty good idea

954
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,900
And while I was thinking about that

955
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:54,060
Here's one for you so we have the eye dog which is one of the sponsors of the pod squad or of this show and a couple other shows

956
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,380
And we've talked extensively about the eye dog. You haven't seen it you can just click on the link to the eye dog

957
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,820
And the show notes the banners are all over the place podcast alley has him and then we have two other things

958
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,660
So it's the MM 50 from logic tech and then something else cool. What's I haven't tried yet

959
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,020
So I can't really tell you how how they are but when I get back to San Fran

960
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,260
I'll start talking about him the

961
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:22,060
Logitech Bluetooth headset which is a Steve Gilmore actually using he liked him once he got him out of the

962
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,740
I heard him talking about him on one of his shows on attention tech

963
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,140
So I haven't actually opened the box yet

964
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,460
She's Steve great endorsement but he's come around and he does like I saw him using him the other day

965
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:38,540
During our we call our food bar Friday, which is our kind of end of the week drink at pod show HQ

966
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,940
So how about this?

967
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,940
I'll give away my personal MM 50

968
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,740
We should of course I'll have re-planished but

969
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,220
Or yeah, I'll give you a new one

970
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,020
how about making up a very cool

971
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,420
funny

972
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,940
different

973
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,220
reinventive ad

974
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,380
That would fit within this podcast for the MM 50 or the eye dog or what either one is for

975
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:08,620
You know, let's try and change what advertising is can we still make it entertaining for the listeners of this particular show

976
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,260
and still sell some product at the same time. I'd love to hear about it so

977
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Maybe I'll do

978
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,820
Well, depends on what I get you know if we get some cool ones in I'll play a couple of them

979
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,060
But we'll choose a winner somehow or maybe only the winner gets played and

980
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,140
I actually is probably it would probably be good if if we have all the crappy ones too

981
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,260
Send this get creative help me out here. Let's figure out how we can make advertising more interesting, please

982
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,100
We have

983
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,900

1005
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
What's the coach calls out Stone Cold Steve Austin?

1006
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,880
Oh, that's all coach music.

1007
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Where's the new coach music?

1008
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Oh, there's two coach music.

1009
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,880
And now the coach's silly and stupid saying another night.

1010
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
Well, here comes the pay.

1011
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
All right.

1012
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
He's in the cyst.

1013
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,880
So coach says Stone Cold, I'm going to give you three minutes.

1014
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
No, we had to roll this back.

1015
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Wiggly even rolled this back just to make sure he didn't say three seconds.

1016
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,880
He didn't. He said, I'm going to give you three minutes to get out here.

1017
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,880
One, two, two.

1018
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Yeah.

1019
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
Yeah.

1020
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
That's what he can't manage.

1021
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
That's how he can manage.

1022
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
That's how he can manage.

1023
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
And you did genius.

1024
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,880
You know, you know, all the WWE could you have two angles in which

1025
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Randy Warden kills the other takers, hit someone fire.

1026
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,880
And then immediately goes, WWE.com for a chat.

1027
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Then you have Mickey games as a soccer who, the week after,

1028
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,880
immediately a trained pro wrestler who is in the ring with her.

1029
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,880
That's a smart wrestling fan, wrestling review show with Joe and Wiggly.

1030
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,880
We hope you like this. Bye, bye.

1031
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,880
That's got to be a big audience for that.

1032
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Wrestling is huge, dude.

1033
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,880
I was interviewed by the London Times yesterday about some football podcasts

1034
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
that are being created here in the UK.

1035
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,880
That's a soccer to you and I.

1036
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
And I was thinking about it.

1037
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,880
It makes so much sense because in all the reporting you see on football,

1038
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
or perhaps any sporting event.

1039
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,880
But particularly football, which is like baseball or American football.

1040
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,880
You know, where is the voice of the fan in mass media?

1041
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,880
You know, it's always some idiot with blue and white paint on his face,

1042
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,880
holding up a sign or standing next to his mates with a, with a big letter on his belly, you know?

1043
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Or it's the epitentiary here, shouted from the stands at the,

1044
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,880
at the, at the ref or the, or other, or opposing team players.

1045
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,880
But where is the voice of the fan?

1046
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
You don't really hear it.

1047
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
You really don't.

1048
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,880
So it makes a hell of a lot of sense at that's happening.

1049
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Cool to see it because there's no outlet whatsoever for him.

1050
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
Oh, let's see.

1051
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,880
A couple of things that are worth mentioning, just this final thing, apparently,

1052
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
and it was on slash dot.

1053
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,880
Sony music has, if you see one of their CDs or a couple of their CDs,

1054
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,880
install shit on your computer, what's called a root kit.

1055
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,880
And it basically opens your computer to some hacks.

1056
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,880
But I think that whole thing sounds pretty legal to me.

1057
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,880
And I think that someone, so there's got to be some consumer group that should take him to court over it.

1058
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
That's horseshit, man.

1059
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,880
And don't install stuff like that.

1060
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,880
If you think that's the way to go, I mean, you're going to be so, come so insignificant.

1061
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,880
Because we have the pot safe music network.

1062
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,880
Which means we got songs we can play.

1063
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
And people do love to hear.

1064
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
And we'll go out for the album.

1065
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,880
And look, we've even got some R&B, like Arianna.

1066
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,880
I've got to have to admit that I'm a sailor.

1067
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,880
It's been written in it's own.

1068
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,880
It's all on the real moment tonight.

1069
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,880
I'm always wrong with the feeling so strong.

1070
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,880
I really want to keep no more.

1071
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,880
I really have to watch it up the front floor.

1072
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,880
I can't take him to the wall.

1073
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,880
It's time I let the man in my life go.

1074
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,880
And baby, I want to be as can be.

1075
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,880
And I want to let the man in my life go.

1076
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
I'm a sailor.

1077
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
And I want to be as can be.

1078
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
I'm a sailor.

1079
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
You're a sailor.

1080
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,880
Because I'm a sailor.

1081
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,880
I want to let you pass your time.

1082
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,880
And we'll even live on it's very good.

1083
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,880
And we'll live on the love.

1084
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,880
And we'll face baby.

1085
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,880
And I hope that you can understand.

1086
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,880
I'll be coming.

1087
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,880
I won't let you pass my love.

1088
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
I'll never pass it up.

1089
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
I love you.

1090
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,880
I really want to keep no more.

1091
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,880
I really have to watch it up the front floor.

1092
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,880
It's no matter how slow it's going down.

1093
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,880
And baby, baby, baby.

1094
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,880
I want to let the man in my life go.

1095
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,880
And I want to let the man in my life go.

1096
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,880
And I want to let the man in my life go.

1097
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:20,880
And we'll even live on it's very good.

1098
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,880
And we'll even live on it's very good.

1099
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,880
And we'll face baby.

1100
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,880
And we'll face baby.

1101
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,880
And we'll face baby.

1102
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,880
And we'll face baby.

1103
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,880
And we'll face baby.

1104
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
And we'll face baby.

1105
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,880
And we'll face baby.

1106
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,880
And we'll face baby.

1107
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,880
And we'll face baby.

1108
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,880
And we'll face baby.

1109
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,880
And we'll face baby.

1110
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,880
And we'll face baby.

1111
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,880
And we'll face baby.

1112
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,880
And we'll face baby.

1113
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,880
And we'll face baby.

1114
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,880
And we'll face baby.

1115
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,880
And we'll face baby.

1116
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,880
And we'll face baby.

1117
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,880
And we'll face baby.

1118
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,880
And we'll face baby.

1119
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,880
And we'll face baby.

1120
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,880
And we'll face baby.

1121
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,880
And we'll face baby.

1122
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,880
And we'll face baby.

1123
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,880
And we'll face baby.

1124
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,880
And we'll face baby.

1125
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:21,880
And we'll face baby.

1126
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,880
Another one that came in on the podcast,

1127
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,880
a music network was uploaded last night.

1128
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,880
Ariana Daddy's baby girl from the R&B category,

1129
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,880
which I haven't found a lot that I like yet,

1130
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,880
but this one I definitely do.

1131
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,880
So you can check that out at music.podshow.com.

1132
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,880
And there was one last audio comment I wanted to share with you

1133
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,880
because it pertains kind of to the biodiesel.

1134
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,880
It's Lee Ann from the Beast.

1135
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,880
I'm listening to you talking about getting yourself a greener vehicle.

1136
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,880
And although I wholeheartedly support it,

1137
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,880
I've a really hard time imagining you pumping your own grease out of the back of it.

1138
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,880
McDonald's.

1139
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
But I will tell you this.

1140
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,880
The bitties are not above that.

1141
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,880
In fact, I can see that becoming one of our favorite activities.

1142
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,880
So if in your travels you discover a van that runs on vegetable oil,

1143
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,880
please put pod shows name on it.

1144
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,880
Our name on it and hand it on over.

1145
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,880
Because we're about ready.

1146
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,880
This last tour, the car rental place,

1147
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,880
didn't have any vans and stocks,

1148
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,880
so they gave us an SUV.

1149
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,880
And all of this stereo was pimpin on our gigantic forward enterprise.

1150
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,880
It was a little bit humiliating driving that thing around the road.

1151
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,880
So help us out.

1152
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,880
We really, really, really do want the grease van.

1153
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,880
Alright baby, I will definitely look for a grease van for you.

1154
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,880
But sure.

1155
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,880
That's it.

1156
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,880
Add them on credit.com for your feedback.

1157
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,880
If you can, if you're going to send an MP3,

1158
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,880
don't attach it, just put it up on a server somewhere.

1159
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,880
Add your ID three tags and send me the link.

1160
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,880
And daily source code.com.

1161
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,880
And of course, you can screw a subscribe to the show through iTunes.

1162
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Hey, thank you very much for letting me bitch a little bit with you.

1163
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
It was very cathartic.

1164
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,880
Another pod show podcast.

1165
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
Stick it in your ear.
