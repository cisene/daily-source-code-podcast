00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll ready hello everybody. It's another weekend edition of the Daily Source Code, which of course means it's not a daily source code. It is time for the MTV Chronicles. Part 3. Is that it Ken? Part 2.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,480
Part 2. Part 2. On the Skype from Lovely Portland, Oregon, is my friend and colleague and MTV

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,480
expert at Fissionado extraordinaire, Kenster J. How are you doing?

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Hello, I'm fine. It's actually a beautiful day here in Portland.

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:46,480
It really sucks here in Gilford. We've had high winds, gale force winds, cold, wet weather.

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,480
That's good for us though, because you'd be out flying. We're not for the follow weather, wouldn't you?

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,480
In fact, yes, I was, you're right. I was scheduled to have a whole weekend of instruction, but the wind commander said,

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,480
he said, Monday, he said, nah, it's going to be shit weather. You don't want to do that.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,480
How about you know that? It's just a shit or inclement.

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,480
No shit. No inclement weather is fine. That's not a problem. It's not a problem.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I mean, it's not a problem to fly. It's just when it comes to instructions, not it's not very handy.

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Well, you know, they say flying is safer than driving.

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,480
No, what they say is the most dangerous part of your trip is the drive to the airport.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,480
That's what it is. So the last time we did this, um, Jesus, it's been like, what has it been?

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Ken, more than six weeks or something like that, I guess. Maybe in longer since we've done a MTV

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Chromome where around the holidays.

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Christ, I was in Utrecht. Was that the one or do we do another one after that?

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,480
No, I was in Uren, you're in that place. Yes, that place. Utrecht. Right. I was with my mom.

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,480
You're in Utrecht. Yeah, Utrecht. Yes, correct. Correct.

20
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:07,480
So this is the MTV Chronicles. This is where Ken and I bring up old MTV memories, kind of like bad Mexican food.

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Uh, we regurgitate. Ken worked there for Ken, how many years? 10 years.

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,480
10 years. I worked there for seven and a half, something like that.

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Well, approximately that. I have the exact date you started here as to the exact date you resigned on the air.

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,480
I don't have that. I know what the exact date. I started on Halloween, uh, 1987.

25
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:44,480
October 31. Yep. Well, actually, they, they claim October 30th, but American born Adam Curry.

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Where's this? Where are you reading this from?

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:56,480
I found a 10 year MTV timeline covering 1981 to 1990 on those put out by the press department on their 10th anniversary.

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Oh, really? It's pretty much a blow by blow of all the big events.

29
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,480
October 30th, 1987, American born Adam Curry.

30
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:13,480
Uh, Europe's most popular TV and radio personality for three consecutive years, debut as MTV VJ.

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,480
And one month later, remote control was launched. Oh, that's right.

32
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:26,480
I'll never forget in that first week, um, they took me up to the offices and people should know that the production and the,

33
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,480
the corporate side were very, very separated at the time. I don't know if it's still,

34
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,480
even because they aren't they all in the same building.

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,480
It's all in the same building now. So I don't think they can possibly have that delightful separation that we had.

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Yeah. So what, so they have to wang the scripts down.

37
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Remember that kid? They would throw some PA in a, in a community car.

38
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,480
You come to script over with this script.

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:01,480
We're late, we're, we're blowing 20 grand an hour on, on crew because we're, our scripts are stuck in a town car in mid, down Manhattan.

40
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Hey, can't, are you downloading porn again? Cause you're cutting out once in a while.

41
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,480
I, I moved my head. Maybe that's the problem.

42
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,480
No, I'm getting a little bit of, you know, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a.

43
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,480
No, I think unfortunately, that's the Skype issue.

44
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Well, no, it's not Skype. It's a bandwidth issue. I'm also sitting on the backup DSL because British telecom fucked up again.

45
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,480
And they've severed my line. Yeah, they severed my, my fat pipe.

46
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Has it severed it? Well, I don't know. It's like, you know, I, so I call up my provider.

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,480
You know, I have this four megabit pipe, which is really nice.

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,480
And then they say, well, you know, it looks like DT is, because it's, it's,

49
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,480
you know, the actual line that comes into the house is provided by British telecom. And of course, British telecom says,

50
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,480
No, it looks fine. No problems here.

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Yeah, and so then the woman called up and says, well, we're going to send an engineer out.

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Are there any security issues we need to be aware of? I said, yes, make sure he's wearing that.

53
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Best of suit, a lead helmet.

54
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Stop winding me up, sir.

55
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,480
So needless to say, we still have a delicious pets here.

56
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Yeah, exactly. Very, beware of the vicious pets.

57
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,480
So, but I'll never forget that first, that first week, then they took me up to the offices.

58
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
You know, you go around to meet everybody. And then I sat down with the press department.

59
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
And they, and I'm sure you're going to remember this.

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,480
And then they, you know, they lined up a couple of calls.

61
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
One of which was to TV guide.

62
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Do you remember what happened?

63
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
No.

64
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
So they asked me all kinds of questions. And they said,

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,480
So, you know, what do you think about Madonna? And I said, ah, she's kind of bitchy.

66
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,480
That was being honest. You know, I'd met her a couple times.

67
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,480
She's not one of my favorite people. You know, like her music, but she's kind of bitchy.

68
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
And they freaked out.

69
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Oh, I was just going to say, I can just picture Tina Exoros and Cheryl Jones.

70
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,480
The press scales just fallen on the floor.

71
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Oh, yeah, because that was the one thing you could not do.

72
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,480
You could not talk negative about any of the artists that we played.

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Which God forbid.

74
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Yeah, I mean, please be fake and lie about everything.

75
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Which I did for successfully almost for seven, half years.

76
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Well, you know, there were there were clips and bands that we liked.

77
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,480
You know, we didn't get to pick the videos.

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
You never had to say in what you got to play.

79
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,480
And you had to be as upbeat about the bad stuff as you did about the good stuff.

80
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Although we didn't, you and I were both in the music meetings for quite a while.

81
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Yeah, we were for quite a while.

82
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Which was interesting.

83
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,480
I don't know if you lasted longer than I did or if I lasted longer than you did.

84
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,480
I stormed out of what and never went back over a clip.

85
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
They refused to play.

86
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
It was a fabulous clip.

87
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,480
It hadn't charted in the, you know, the top 40 R and R or whatever the hell they were looking in.

88
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Yeah.

89
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
So they wouldn't play it.

90
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,480
And that was so counter to anything that had ever made MTV great.

91
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,480
I mean, MTV became great because they played stuff.

92
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
The known else would play.

93
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
And I said here, watching people consulting the billboard to.

94
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Yeah.

95
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Radio writer charted in top 40 radio before they'd even consider it.

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,480
I just was disgusted.

97
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,480
No, I walked out after, um, I didn't walk out.

98
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,480
I didn't go back after, um, uh, member Abby Conowitch.

99
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Yes.

100
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
He was the director of, was he director of music program or something like that?

101
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Yes.

102
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
And hired a Matt Farber.

103
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Right.

104
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,480
And so Abby is a, he's a guy, by the way, or that is questionable perhaps.

105
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,480
But then he went on to run Madonna's Maverick record label.

106
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
But so I'll never forget the meeting was almost over.

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
I think you were still in that meeting, can't.

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Oh, no. Oh, we can't leave yet because we haven't added anything from Warner Brothers yet.

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
I was like, what the fuck?

110
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
So this has nothing to do with the music.

111
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,480
It's only about we haven't played political footsies properly.

112
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
So I didn't go back.

113
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Oh, yeah.

114
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
You had to play a certain number of clips.

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,480
You know, and if you wanted to get an exclusive on the new motley crib clip,

116
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,480
the motley crew clip, then you had to play two pieces or crap at least three times a week.

117
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Oh, and we put them in the, that's, that's how the, wasn't that how the basement bin was, um,

118
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
was created.

119
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Something like the buzz bin.

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
The buzz bin basement bin.

121
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
The buzz bin.

122
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,480
That's, it was like, it would, if you were in the buzz bin, that meant your rotation was,

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
you were played once at 3 a.m.

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Once a week at 3 a.m.

125
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Like, was that the buzz bin or was the buzz bin for the hot clip of the week?

126
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I can't remember all the various tags now.

127
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
I think they might have, they might have changed it later.

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,480
But I remember specifically people say, yeah, well, well, well, well, yeah, well,

129
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,480
they will throw them in the, well, throw those clips in the buzz bin if we can get them exclusive on this.

130
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Yeah, that was through a clock in the morning.

131
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,480
That, that was always the best time to watch the channel because that's when they played the weird stuff right on right on.

132
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Also in 1987, I MTV launched it.

133
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
No, Australia.

134
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Richard Wilkins.

135
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Yep.

136
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Kevin.

137
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
See you'll join.

138
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Club MTV debuted.

139
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
My God.

140
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Right before you started the same month you started MTV's week in rock debuted.

141
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
I used to love doing that show.

142
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Remember when the VJs would, would host it.

143
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Yeah.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Well, Kurt came the year after.

145
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,480
So for just a period of time for one year, you guys actually got to host something news related and then they got Kurt.

146
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
It was a great.

147
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I really liked doing that show.

148
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
That was a lot of fun.

149
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Now did you do?

150
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
No, this was right before you joined MTV.

151
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Did the motley crews, the motley crews to know where contest?

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I wasn't a part of that.

153
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Four winners were flown to Bermuda where they boarded a private yacht and went on a cruise of the Bermuda triangle with the four guys in motley crew.

154
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
There's not forts and enough to be a part of that.

155
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Well, you may have been luck.

156
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
He frankly, can you imagine?

157
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,480
And that was after the pink houses.

158
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Yes, it was.

159
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,480
But it was, yeah, it was the next year that Kurt Loder left Rolling Stone magazine to join MTV.

160
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
He's still there.

161
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Dude, how old is Kurt 60?

162
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
He's got to be older than 60.

163
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
I really don't know.

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,480
He doesn't look like he's changed at all, but I please.

165
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Please.

166
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,480
He always looked kind of tired, but you know, Kurt was always out of lot.

167
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,480
You know, scooping, scooping those news stories.

168
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Oh, yeah, right.

169
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Well, John Norse is still there, too, right?

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
He finally got what he wanted.

171
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
John is still there.

172
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Well, when I was the John, I got a John started as a production assistant and then

173
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,480
If I could fuck this way to the top.

174
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Oh, yes.

175
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Yes.

176
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
I can't comment about that.

177
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I wasn't certainly involved or privy to any details of that.

178
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
But I don't know it.

179
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,480
I don't have positive proof, but he always was such a jealous little queen.

180
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
That's what he was.

181
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
He just wanted.

182
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Yes.

183
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Yes.

184
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Yes.

185
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
That's my, that's what I was doing.

186
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Back on my overall experience with John over the years.

187
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
It's neither overly positive nor overly negative.

188
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,480
He was relatively easy to deal with from my perspective.

189
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
But he had been in staffer.

190
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
So he never, he never kind of got difficult.

191
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Then you weren't that difficulty, but you know, you drove yourself to the studio.

192
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,480
And yeah, I didn't, I didn't want to have no forgot damn cars.

193
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Take, pick him up.

194
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
That's a paid in the ass.

195
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
You picked your clothes.

196
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Patricia did your makeup.

197
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,480
So when you walked in the door, you were ready to go.

198
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,480
And there were a lot of premedonists that required hours of maintenance.

199
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
And, you know, yeah.

200
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,480
But I was John was, John was never one of those.

201
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,480
He never, you know, if he didn't play games like that with me.

202
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
So you did some homework for the show, right?

203
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
You, you prep some stuff right there.

204
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,480
A few different things.

205
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Speaking of news, there are two people that we worked with at MTV over the years that are both doing quite well for themselves here in the States.

206
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
I don't know if they're on in Europe.

207
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Karen Bryan, two is one of the VJs that was kind of the third group of VJs after you and Julie and Kevin.

208
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,480
But she, what she was also news first.

209
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,480
She was in Karen Bryan was news first, wasn't she?

210
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
No, that was Allison Stewart.

211
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Oh, Allison Stewart.

212
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm sorry, right.

213
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Karen Bryan.

214
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
And that was the other person.

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Karen Bryan came in as a VJ.

216
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
She was a, she looked a lot like Allison Stewart actually.

217
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
And the two had known each other.

218
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,480
They had gone to college together at Brown.

219
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Gorgeous black girl, light skin, curly hair.

220
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Very, very similar to Allison Stewart.

221
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,480
I don't remember how that she looked like.

222
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Because we hired after that whole next wave.

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Then you were just kind of doing the top 20 video countdown and dial MTV.

224
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
But mostly you predecessor to TRL.

225
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Right.

226
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,480
You would come in once we can do the top 20 countdown.

227
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
And they had Karen Bryan and Steve Isaacs.

228
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Oh, my gosh.

229
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Steve Isaacs.

230
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Who else was in that batch?

231
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Kennedy.

232
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Let's see.

233
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
It was Steve.

234
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Karen Bryan.

235
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Kennedy.

236
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Duff.

237
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
John Norris.

238
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Todd.

239
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,480
One was a VJ for a while during that whole thing.

240
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,480
But Karen Bryan was in that third batch of VJs.

241
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
And she is now the entertainment watch reporter on CNN.

242
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Hold on.

243
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
I'm Googling her right now.

244
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
I want to get a picture of her.

245
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
K-A-R-Y-N.

246
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Oh, that's why that's why it's showing some horrible images.

247
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Bryan, B-R-Y-A-N-T-I.

248
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Would you end up with it?

249
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
You don't want to know.

250
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Oh, yeah.

251
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Yeah.

252
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Yeah.

253
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Did she very cute?

254
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
There you go.

255
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Yeah.

256
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
I remember her now.

257
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Okay.

258
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah.

259
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
I didn't really ever hang out with her.

260
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
I don't think.

261
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
No.

262
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Because at that point you were coming in once a week.

263
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Right.

264
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,480
And Allison Stewart, who was Steve Leads assistant.

265
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
Assistant.

266
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Right.

267
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,480
When you started it, and then Allison went to the news department and did pretty well

268
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
with them, TV news.

269
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
She did a lot of the choose or lose.

270
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
She used to do a lot of the political.

271
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
She was good.

272
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
campaign coverage.

273
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Yeah.

274
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,480
She's been doing daytime anchor on MSNBC here in the States now.

275
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Right.

276
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Quite a period of time.

277
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
She fills in a lot at night.

278
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm countdown with Keith Obermann on NBC.

279
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Okay.

280
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
So those are two.

281
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Too bad MSNBC is going to shut down.

282
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Well.

283
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Seeing that, you know, it's funny.

284
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,480
For a while MSNBC was really kick and CNN's button out for the last couple of years.

285
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
That's kind of changed back.

286
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Yeah.

287
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Well, it didn't turn out the way they wanted it.

288
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
They wanted it to be a total multimedia.

289
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Don't forget what the M stands for.

290
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Yeah.

291
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Well, that's true.

292
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Or the MS actually.

293
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Sands from Microsoft.

294
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Well, and then there's CNBC.

295
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Well, yeah.

296
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
But that's just cable NBC or whatever.

297
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,480
So Karen Bryant and who else is doing very well.

298
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Allison Stewart and MSNBC.

299
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Okay.

300
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,480
Karen on CNN and Allison on MSNBC.

301
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
So we talked about the post life of a VJ and television not being too successful.

302
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Those.

303
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Which means two exceptions.

304
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Neither of them are making any real money though because you know that's just like MTV pay there.

305
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
I don't know.

306
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
I don't know.

307
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Oh, please.

308
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
I had to see an end came over here.

309
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
And one of those guys that you recognize.

310
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
You know, like forget his name.

311
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Yeah.

312
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
I talked about one.

313
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Yeah.

314
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
One of their big guys.

315
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Yeah.

316
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
I forget it.

317
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Well, it's not that gut.

318
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Well, yeah.

319
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
One of those guys.

320
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
He was really nice.

321
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
You know, he said that.

322
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
It's fucked up.

323
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
He was saying he was really complaining.

324
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
I said, man, son, just like MTV.

325
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
So yeah.

326
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
It's very political.

327
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
And it's, uh, and there's not a lot of money in it.

328
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
It's, that's hard.

329
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
You know, it's very expensive to run a 24 hour date news channel.

330
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
I was talking not too long ago to somebody who was, uh,

331
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,480
is an anchor out here for the local NBC affiliate in Portland, Oregon.

332
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,480
And I could make more money at a Starbucks, I think.

333
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
As if I restarted.

334
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Yeah.

335
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Hi.

336
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm Ken Stranger.

337
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Yeah.

338
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Is a really good barista in Portland.

339
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
And you can apparently anchoring the NBC affiliate news.

340
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Yeah.

341
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Also, since the last time we did an MTV Chronicles, uh, a lawsuit was announced between

342
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Julie Brown and NBC.

343
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
No way.

344
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
What happened?

345
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Oh, they probably had a pilot that they didn't, they didn't do or something.

346
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
No, this is, this is good.

347
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
This is really good.

348
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
You'll enjoy it.

349
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Yum.

350
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Yum.

351
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Remember about two or three years ago, Julie did that.

352
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
God awful show called.

353
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
I'm a celebrity.

354
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Get me the hell out of here.

355
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Oh, I know the show, but I didn't see her on it.

356
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
That would have been pretty funny.

357
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
I watched one episode of it.

358
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
And, and she was okay.

359
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
I couldn't stomach a land of Stewart.

360
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
She was a finding bitch.

361
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Just like, a lot of, no.

362
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Who was a lot of Stewart again?

363
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Rod Stewart sex life.

364
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Oh, geez.

365
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Okay.

366
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Was that the English version that just aired over there?

367
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Was that a separate?

368
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Because, you know, it airs all over the world now.

369
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
I think that was the same version.

370
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
It aired everywhere.

371
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,480
It was the first season they had done it.

372
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
And I can't even remember who all was there.

373
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,480
But, I mean, you know, these are all quote-unquote husbands.

374
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Yeah.

375
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I mean, a land of Stewart as Rod Stewart sex wife.

376
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
I'm not sure she ever really was, but.

377
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
All right.

378
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Julie, Julie, hey, that her got some told her off on the program.

379
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Julie shouldn't.

380
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
I mean, the minute you go in that, you basically labor yourself,

381
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
yourself as a husband, right?

382
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
That's kind of the whole deal.

383
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
That would be like a jump the shark moment.

384
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Yeah.

385
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Yes.

386
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
You're done it either.

387
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Frankly, I think in retrospect, I don't know what the hell she was thinking.

388
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I don't mean to do it if she doesn't either because here, here's the basis of the lawsuit

389
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
between her and the production company.

390
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,480
During the taping of the show, and I missed the episode fortunately.

391
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Julie got into a bathtub filled with leeches.

392
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,480
And was completely buried under a pile of squirming leeches.

393
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Well, that's apparently they promised her this was safe.

394
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,480
That's um, according to the lawsuit, she still has permanent scars on her body

395
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
from the leech bites.

396
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Oh, I bet.

397
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
I bet.

398
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Totally.

399
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
My goodness.

400
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,480
So that was the basis of the lawsuit was permanent scarring,

401
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
caused by being put in a bathtub full of leeches.

402
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,480
When the producers had assured her it was okay.

403
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
So is she suing NBC or the production company?

404
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
It was ABC and the production company.

405
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,480
We're both both named in the lawsuit.

406
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Wow, has that come to court yet?

407
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Or what's the deal?

408
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Uh, I don't know.

409
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Oh, man.

410
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,480
I saw it on the news and I thought, oh, that's interesting for the MTV

411
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Chronicle.

412
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Smoke smoking friend.

413
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Our good friend Julie Brown smoking going should should get a hold of all the paperwork

414
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
and publish that.

415
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
That'd be pretty funny.

416
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,480
And and you and Julie always had a funny relationship.

417
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
There was a competitiveness.

418
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,480
There was a bickering that went on.

419
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
But you guys were okay in the end.

420
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I think there was an abonding event.

421
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,480
You guys got put in the same limo going to like the.

422
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Oh, it was a New Year's Eve show or it was MTV video music awards or something.

423
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,480
You and Julie ended up writing in a limo together,

424
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
which everybody had been very worried about.

425
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,480
The limo backed over some old woman.

426
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
God, can't I can't remember that.

427
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Oh, dude.

428
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Oh, wait a minute.

429
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
It was in New York though, right?

430
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Yeah.

431
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,480
And the limousine like backed into some old woman.

432
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,480
You guys were out like helping the old woman up and everything.

433
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
And Julie was screaming at the limo driver.

434
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah.

435
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
I do remember.

436
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
And somehow you guys bonded during that limo ride.

437
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
And you guys were okay after that.

438
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
But you guys always had kind of a funny way.

439
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,480
And you know what I was because Julie had an excellent knack.

440
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
And it was really the British humor.

441
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,480
She had a very good knack of completely tearing you a new asshole on the air.

442
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
And I just had no recourse.

443
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,480
You know, I had no way to get because just I couldn't I couldn't do it.

444
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
You know, and and so anything.

445
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,480
If whenever I'd like tried to, you know, to the zinger back,

446
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
it always kind of came out wrong.

447
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Yeah.

448
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
I've got clips of Julie.

449
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,480
There was a great one where she was talking about what she wanted for Christmas.

450
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
She wasn't feeling well that day.

451
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
I think she'd been out partying with Billy.

452
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I told the night before somebody that she was and she said,

453
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
I I don't know.

454
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
I just maybe a new blow dryer.

455
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
I just want to look like Adam Curry.

456
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Yeah.

457
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I don't know.

458
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Anyway, up next.

459
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
You know.

460
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
I didn't mind that.

461
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,480
I didn't mind the hair jokes because everyone's just fucking jealous of my hair.

462
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Well, you know, do you remember the time Julie had those dreadlocks put in?

463
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
That was a great story.

464
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
No.

465
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,480
She was in the chair for, I think, 12 hours having dreadlocks put in.

466
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
And she came into the studio the next morning and she looked like an Asian woman.

467
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Her eyes were all drawn back.

468
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
And she was an agony.

469
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
She was an agony.

470
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,480
And they had put like 14 pounds of hair on her head.

471
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,480
And it was literally pulling her scalp out.

472
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
I mean, I do remember that.

473
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
And she put up with it for about a day.

474
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
And then she got like a pair of hedge tremors and locked them all off.

475
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
It sold her length.

476
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Is that their prime?

477
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Yeah.

478
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
She cut them off.

479
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Yeah.

480
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Hair looked like shit then.

481
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
That was horrible.

482
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
You had to wear her hair up in a plastic bag.

483
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
I think they had to put wigs up on her.

484
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,480
Speaking of which, you know who sent me an email the other day from MTV management

485
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
from the early days.

486
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Steve leads.

487
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,480
No, I've been talking to Steve a lot, actually recently.

488
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
No, actually.

489
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
I've seen him on Skype.

490
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Steve, I always like.

491
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
I got him on Skype.

492
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
I got him on Skype.

493
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,480
He, he, and you know, I told him in Stali's like,

494
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
wow, this is like a free phone.

495
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Oh, yes, Steve.

496
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
No, Tom Hunter.

497
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Tom Hunter.

498
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Hold on.

499
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Oh, Tom Hunter.

500
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Yeah.

501
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
What was his gig?

502
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,480
He was, I think he was one of the in the music programming department when they were still running

503
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
at lingerie.

504
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Or Abby was he?

505
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
He was before.

506
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,480
No, he was before Abby Connor, which, and remembered that prick John, what's his name?

507
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Canaling.

508
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
That one.

509
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
He was talent and artist relations though.

510
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
I've got a good.

511
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
I've got two.

512
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Well, Matt Farber came after Abby Connor, which.

513
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
I'll personally tell you about Tom Hunter, just a brief update.

514
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
He's divorced.

515
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
He's remarried.

516
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
He's been married for five years.

517
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Has three.

518
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I think three kids all grown up.

519
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
And he lives in Dallas now.

520
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
And he's teaching.

521
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
And, and he's doing like a weekend gig on the college radio station.

522
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
And he's lost like a thousand pounds.

523
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
I was just going to say as he lost weight.

524
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Yeah.

525
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Yeah.

526
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
He looks really good.

527
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
He looks really good.

528
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
What's he teaching like broadcast or radio or something?

529
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Communication stuff.

530
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Yeah.

531
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Yeah.

532
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,480
I'm just going to teach her that would be when I think back to my degree in communications.

533
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,480
If only I had teachers who'd been in charge of programming an MTV.

534
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Yeah.

535
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Because then you didn't listen to him.

536
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Like, oh, this guy actually had no sum.

537
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,480
You know, I remember when I went to West Virginia to school for that entire semester.

538
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,480
Remember my communications classes.

539
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
And like, you know, if you really knew what you're talking about,

540
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
wouldn't you have like a real fucking job?

541
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
I suppose.

542
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,480
I mean, I had somebody at my college who had never been outside this state of Ohio before

543
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,480
to tell me at one point that I didn't have what it took to make it in New York.

544
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Well, you're, well, you are in Portland, you know.

545
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
I am now.

546
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
But that was after I conquered Manhattan.

547
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Yes.

548
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
You took the city.

549
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
You took the city.

550
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Okay.

551
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
So that was after, yeah.

552
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
That was, this is, well, you moved to it.

553
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
So what can you say?

554
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Yeah.

555
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
We all things change.

556
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
His life goes on priorities change.

557
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
So Tom skews me.

558
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
What a nice bit of philosophy there.

559
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
I love that.

560
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Thank you.

561
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
That's true.

562
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
So he's doing good.

563
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
He's, he's all right.

564
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
And then John can only have a little win.

565
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
We easily cocksucker.

566
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
God, I hated him.

567
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
John can only.

568
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Yes.

569
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Because I'll tell you why.

570
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
And then you can continue.

571
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
When I had my good memo.

572
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
When I had my Richard Marx fall out.

573
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Yeah.

574
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Which I don't remember how that actually went.

575
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
But Richard started on the radio program.

576
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
No.

577
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
No.

578
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
It did not.

579
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
It started on the top 20 video countdown where there was.

580
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
It ended up on the radio.

581
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Yeah.

582
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Well, that's where it escalated.

583
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
But it was something.

584
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I can't even remember what it was about.

585
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
It was something so fucking stupid.

586
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,480
But he was such a goddamn control freak, Richard Marx.

587
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
And then he said, I do recall this all of a sudden.

588
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
It may come to me.

589
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
You had said something that was really, I mean.

590
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
But it was scripted.

591
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,480
It was like a quirky MTV joke that every other artist go like,

592
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Okay.

593
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,480
You know, after you play the video for the 20 millionth time,

594
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
you know, you got to say something else.

595
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
And whatever it was, he really went off.

596
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,480
And he went up to the office and tried to get me fired.

597
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480
And John Cannelly immediately went,

598
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Yes.

599
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Well, we should get rid of him.

600
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
He is like, thank you, mother fucker.

601
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
I was horrible.

602
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
I do remember we had to pull tape.

603
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
You know, we've got to pull tape and say.

604
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
What did he say?

605
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Exactly.

606
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
The Richard Marx fiasco.

607
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
I don't remember what it was.

608
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,480
It was not, you know, it wasn't.

609
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,480
He obviously had issues.

610
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
It was unnecessary.

611
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Well, I just saw him on TV recently.

612
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
He's got a new album out.

613
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
And it struck me even then.

614
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,480
The years later.

615
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
What is it?

616
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
10, 15 years later.

617
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
He still looked neurotic.

618
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Well, he, first of all, he's a great songwriter.

619
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
No doubt about it.

620
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Yeah.

621
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Great songwriter.

622
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Good producer, actually.

623
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
He's been doing some major hits.

624
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Yeah, no.

625
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
And so I'll give them all that.

626
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,480
But then I was hosting a show called Hitline USA.

627
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
And so it's Rick Kalman has that tape.

628
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
We should get that tape.

629
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Actually, I have a real, I have an original real to real of that as well here.

630
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
I don't have the tape.

631
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
And he goes off.

632
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,480
And he says, on the air, he starts saying, well, your hair looks like, what do you say?

633
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
I don't know.

634
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
But he was the last person that should have been making an air.

635
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Really?

636
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,480
And then he said, I hope you, you know, oh, because I was smoking at the time.

637
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
I hope you get cancer.

638
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
He said, I hope your lips fell off.

639
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
No.

640
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
He said, I hope they got cancer.

641
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
That's what he said.

642
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
And your lips fell off.

643
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
It was horrible.

644
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
You completely went off.

645
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
It's very stupid.

646
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Did that show ever aired?

647
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Did you guys get it?

648
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
It was live.

649
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
It was live when that happened.

650
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
You kidding me?

651
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
It was one of the best.

652
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
It was one of the best shows I've ever done on radio.

653
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,480
It just couldn't believe what he was saying.

654
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Everyone loved it, you know?

655
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
I don't think you did well with it.

656
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
I don't think you got, you just kind of laughed at him.

657
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
But you didn't really fling mud back.

658
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
And God knows you could have.

659
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Well, you know, what do you say to that?

660
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
You know?

661
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
What do you say to that?

662
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Well, he meant it.

663
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
He really meant it.

664
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,480
No, I think I said, no, he said, you're going to be out of a job.

665
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
And I'll see you on the unemployment line.

666
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
You'll be ahead of me or something like that.

667
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
I can't remember what it was.

668
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
But we all did okay in the end.

669
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
It was stupid.

670
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
But the cancer thing really bothered me.

671
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,480
That was an unnecessary and unfair comment.

672
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
He still looks really uptight.

673
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
And like he doesn't have a sense of humor.

674
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Because he really wanted to be a rock and roll superstar.

675
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
And he just didn't have it in him.

676
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
You know, he wanted to be.

677
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
What was the band?

678
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
He was always hanging out with.

679
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Well, first of all, in his, in his band.

680
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Who was in his band?

681
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Remember who played in his band?

682
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
Remember.

683
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Come on.

684
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Richie, kind of him.

685
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Wasn't, no, not, not Richie, kind of him.

686
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Or was it?

687
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
Who was the guy who went?

688
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Yeah.

689
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Yeah.

690
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
He had fucking happy.

691
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
It was, it wasn't Richie, kind of.

692
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
It was someone like that.

693
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
It was like some, some doork from some happy days.

694
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Like grown up.

695
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Yeah.

696
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Who the hell was that?

697
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
He was playing bass in his band.

698
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Wasn't somebody from the Parkridge family.

699
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Well, Donnie, Danny Bonna, Doochie.

700
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Danny Bonna, Doochie, and bass.

701
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
He's funny.

702
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
We had a good time.

703
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
I, I hung out with him a lot.

704
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
He was very funny.

705
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Danny's funny.

706
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Remember when he got, when he got picked up, and he was working for MTV.

707
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Somewhere in, in Florida, he got picked up for, for soliciting a transvestite process.

708
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
Transvestite.

709
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
That's right.

710
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Whoops.

711
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
That's happened to a lot of famous people.

712
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
I don't get that.

713
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
He's red.

714
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
You're gray.

715
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
There was some tiff with that Murphy, and it transvestite too.

716
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Well, she males are very intriguing to straight guys.

717
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
John Cannelly.

718
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:35,480
I found, you know, I have a huge box of paperwork, funny memos and things that I saved

719
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,480
over the years, and at some point over the last five years since we did the last MTV Chronicles,

720
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I pulled out my two favorite memos of my entire 10 year period at MTV.

721
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Oh, man.

722
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Oh.

723
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
These are the two.

724
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,480
John Cannelly's is actually my second favorite memo.

725
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
I know what the first one is, but I won't give it away.

726
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,480
October 18th, 1991, to all MTV staff from John Cannelly, subject hammer under

727
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Oh, no.

728
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
The hammer memo.

729
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
That's the hammer memo.

730
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
The original.

731
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Please be advised that effective immediately, MC Hammer is now just hammer.

732
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
All references.

733
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
I love this.

734
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:26,480
This is the clinch to all references, both on there and off air to this artist should include

735
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,480
this change immediately without reflection.

736
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Violators will be shot.

737
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Prosecute.

738
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Does it say shot?

739
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
No.

740
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
No.

741
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
It does not say that.

742
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
We'll be swiftly terminated.

743
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Yeah.

744
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I mean, I have a reference.

745
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Both on air and off air.

746
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,480
So we can't even say MC Hammer in the fucking hallway.

747
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,480
I remember we used to go like, if you hammer.

748
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Not all mighty.

749
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,480
I just thought of one other really funny John Cannelly story before we move onto the other

750
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
memo.

751
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Madonna.

752
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,480
I can't remember what video it was, but they had made this huge deal about this Madonna

753
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
video.

754
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Nobody, it was the church, the Pepsi one.

755
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Remember the one that got like a prayer.

756
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Like a prayer like a prayer.

757
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Like a prayer.

758
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
It was like a prayer.

759
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Yeah.

760
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
All right.

761
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,980
Because at MTV, we taped a day or two in advance and we had to tape that the world premiered

762
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,480
the video two days before the video actually was available.

763
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,980
The record label and John Cannelly made this huge freaking production about coming over

764
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
to the studio.

765
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Oh boy.

766
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,780
Give us a VJs and the senior staff a private screening of the video so that we could

767
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
tape it.

768
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,780
And they brought the video over in a Brink's truck.

769
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,780
I mean, it was just the most ridiculous stunt anybody.

770
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,780
And this wasn't even a televised stunt.

771
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,780
This was behind the scenes.

772
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,780
Was this the one with the wires running to the next room, Ken?

773
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,780
Yeah.

774
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,780
There were a number of us downtown Julie Brown included.

775
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,780
I hate to malign her in this way.

776
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
I had no part of this.

777
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
I knew about it.

778
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
No, you did not.

779
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
I don't even know if you were in the building.

780
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
Oh, yeah.

781
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,780
I knew about it.

782
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,780
But I didn't want to have anything to do with it.

783
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
There was no evil intent.

784
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,540
We weren't going to leak the clip.

785
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,180
We weren't going to make copies of it and distribute it over the internet because there

786
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,780
was no internet at the time.

787
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:25,780
We only had one computer in the building and it was a wing.

788
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,780
We drilled a hole through the wall and we were upstairs with the officers.

789
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,780
I remember that.

790
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,980
Yeah, upstairs at Unitel behind the behind the whole rack with the VCR system was because

791
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,420
we knew they were bringing over like a three quarter inch humatic, you know, the big

792
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
tape.

793
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,900
And we drilled a hole through the wall and we ran the cables and we did a VHS machine

794
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,220
behind the couch in the lounge, the VJ lounge back there.

795
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:57,020
And before the record label even showed up, it was a two hour tape on super long

796
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
to play.

797
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:04,260
So it would record for like six hours and we all had to record a deck would record.

798
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,260
Record label comes in.

799
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,900
They play the clip, you know, big production and everybody claps.

800
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,140
Meanwhile, all this is going on speaking of Steve Lee's love Steve leads, but this

801
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,260
is the only thing Steve ever did that I really thought was an office thing to do.

802
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
I remember it.

803
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,940
Steve noticed the wire going through the wall and he went like, well, no, he quietly kind

804
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,780
of opened the door to the VJ lounge and went in there.

805
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,780
And I'm sitting there thinking, oh, shit, the gig is up, you know.

806
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,020
And then the door opens and Steve comes out and he's got a VHS tape in his hands and I'm

807
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,060
like, we are so buff off.

808
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,260
And you know, it's Steve should have done his weighted to the record company left.

809
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,260
Of course.

810
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,660
Everything was over and then, you know, said, you guys stay here for a minute and then

811
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,500
he should have come in and ripped this out a new asshole.

812
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,820
But he could have taken us to the cleaners.

813
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,860
And steady handed the tape to the head of the record label and said, here's somebody

814
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,860
was pirating this.

815
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,380
Oh, I do remember that.

816
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
Oh, it's lame.

817
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,060
Well, the shit hit the fan and can now he went berserk and Julie was sitting there.

818
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,940
She was laughing a bit.

819
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,940
She was laughing.

820
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,660
Julie didn't give a damn, I mean, and that was one of the things the MTV management

821
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,740
so hated about Julie is she didn't give a damn what they had to say about her or anything

822
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
out.

823
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
That's right.

824
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
She could care less.

825
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,340
And went off and at one point, you know, saying how we were all pieces of shit and

826
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,340
everything.

827
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,500
And Julie stood up and said, I hear it comes.

828
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:36,460
She said, you fucking cons, I remember it.

829
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:41,340
And then just went off at Cannelly, ripped him a new asshole and just like walked out of

830
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,460
the room and said, I'm not going to sit here and listen to you talk to me like that and

831
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,700
just walked out of the room and he turned like 27 shades of purple.

832
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,700
Yeah.

833
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,140
So what was he got fired?

834
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
No.

835
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,140
I had to take the wrap for that.

836
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Yeah.

837
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
You got to apologize.

838
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,780
I had to go apologize to Judy McGrath personally.

839
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,740
He believes she's still running that channel.

840
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,060
That's amazing to me.

841
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,980
I saw Judy McGrath at JJ Jackson's funeral reunion service.

842
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980
We had a New York.

843
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,900
And you were almost there, in fact, you missed, I think by like a week, you were going

844
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
to be in New York.

845
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
I wasn't invited.

846
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,900
I wasn't invited.

847
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Oh, yeah.

848
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,900
You would have been invited.

849
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,140
Judy was a friend of MTV, not to the cocktail reunion thing.

850
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Yeah.

851
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,740
You definitely would have been invited to that.

852
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
Okay.

853
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,780
And that was a trip because I looked for my wallet.

854
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,580
I started at MTV when I was 19 or 20 years old.

855
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,860
A lot of the people that were at this thing were there at the time and they were probably

856
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,900
in their late 30s to 40s back when I was 19 or 20 years old.

857
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,420
So when I wallstained to this room last April, Jerry has been expecting to be walking

858
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,460
into like a geriatric convention.

859
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
Oh, man.

860
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
It was a trip.

861
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,980
But Judy did show up and it was actually really cool to see her and we chatted

862
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,420
for a few minutes and I said to her, Judy, it's so nice to actually have a conversation

863
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,860
with you when I'm not absolutely scared shitless because she was a frightening woman.

864
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,820
You know, I never, I found it.

865
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,140
I still find to be the most unhipp woman in show business, which is why, maybe that's

866
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,860
why she's good at what she does.

867
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,860
But she was always the driver behind.

868
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,860
I'll give her this.

869
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,500
She was the driver behind long-form programming and less videos.

870
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,540
That is completely Judy McGrath.

871
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,020
She was very icy, but I have discovered over the years that Judy really, or I mean that

872
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,620
Judy really does have a soft spot and she cares about the people that she worked with

873
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,540
way back then and when she was at the party and we were talking about, you know, she used

874
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
to write copy.

875
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,780
I mean, she was a copywriter for the very, very early days of MTV.

876
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,420
She was just one of the gang hanging out and I'm looking at her thinking she's this, this

877
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,980
is she's another president of MTV Networks, right?

878
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,700
Now that Kristen's been elevated.

879
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,300
Yeah, to Viacom corporate, whatever.

880
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Yeah.

881
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,060
First, and yeah, and it was Judy that called me when I got promoted to manager of

882
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,820
on our talent and said congratulations, I know you'll do a great job.

883
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,300
You'd better and then hung up the phone on me.

884
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Yeah, that was like power trip, woman on power trip thing.

885
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,540
But she, but she, she changed the channel to what it is today.

886
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,820
I do have respect for Judy, all right.

887
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,220
We had talked about Abbey Connoisseur.

888
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,900
Wait, you're going to do one more John Connelly memo.

889
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,260
You had another cannelly memo.

890
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,380
I don't, that was the, that was the cannelly memo was the hammer.

891
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,340
But that was your second favorite.

892
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,260
That was my favorite favorite wasn't it cannelly memo.

893
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,060
That was the favorite Jackson Farber memo.

894
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,260
What was that was that the Michael Jackson memo?

895
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,540
Yeah, timely, I guess.

896
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,660
Do you have the official memo there?

897
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,660
I do.

898
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,940
Would you like, would you care to share it with our, it still has my name?

899
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,580
It was still, it still has the original fax header on it, where it was faxed to the studio.

900
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,940
So let's see what we said it up because we had taped the Michael Jackson weekend,

901
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,020
which was a part of another deal because we had, it was like three things, if I'm not mistaken.

902
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,100
One, what was all about getting Michael Jackson to perform on the video, musical awards.

903
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,180
And by the way, if you ever said VMAs on the air, you were punished.

904
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,180
Yeah, it was.

905
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,620
You had to say video music awards.

906
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,300
You were not among TV.

907
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,500
The whole world says VMAs.

908
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,660
The whole world says VMAs, but we had to say the MTV video musical awards.

909
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,740
And as a part of the deal, was that the one where he got the award in his name that I had to present to him?

910
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,940
The Van Guard award.

911
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:33,900
No, no, excuse me, excuse me, that would be the MTV video musical award, Michael Jackson video Van Guard, the award of the year.

912
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,900
The Guard award.

913
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,100
Yeah, somewhere in this timeline and I'm kind of flipping through it.

914
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,700
I didn't want to bug things down here, but it's somewhere in here.

915
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,540
It talks about when you went and presented that silly ass.

916
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,340
That was a fun trip though, because I went with Freston, with Tom Freston.

917
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:55,340
I actually put makeup on Tom Freston because he looks up front and beat December 23rd, 1989.

918
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:07,980
MTV CEO Tom Freston and MTV VJ Adam Curry present Michael Jackson with the Michael Jackson video Van Guard of the year.

919
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,180
Artists of artists of the decade, right?

920
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,780
I'm sort of the decade, right?

921
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:23,100
In Los Angeles, that was where they, Michael Jackson had to stand on a box because he had to be taller than you and your like six and a half feet tall.

922
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,340
So that was difficult for everyone.

923
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:31,180
But so as a part of that, there was also, and you already mentioned that we recorded the weekends.

924
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,740
We recorded on Thursday, right?

925
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,900
So we do Saturday and Sunday would tape on Thursday.

926
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,900
Monday was usually taped on Friday.

927
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,260
Tuesday, Tuesday was Wednesday and Thursday.

928
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,740
Wednesday was Friday, Thursday was Saturday and Sunday and Friday was Friday.

929
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Right.

930
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,740
So Tuesday and Thursday is where 48's and 48's, that's right.

931
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,380
So we did a 48 on Thursday, which basically it's like a whole day of work, right?

932
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:00,220
So that's 100 grand worth of, well, more, probably like $140,000 worth of production time.

933
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,820
Yeah, I mean, we're talking, you know, two full days of the programming had been taped in one day.

934
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,780
And then we were always happy because on Friday, we'd have a 24 because that meant we were only taping from Monday.

935
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,500
That was like a half day.

936
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,740
So, you know, as I was like, Friday was like, oh, yeah, you know, it's got a 24.

937
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,540
We can go home early and get the weekend started.

938
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:21,500
But then came when I'm during a 48, everybody'd have to run and change clothes, you know,

939
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,580
do the, and then, you know, come back on the set and pretend like it was a whole new day.

940
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,620
Yeah, just so you know, I mean, we never saw that.

941
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,700
Typically introduced the same videos over.

942
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,500
You're just introduced before and make it sound fresh.

943
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,460
Yes, exactly.

944
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,980
Come on, energy, baby.

945
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,100
So then the, then the memo came down.

946
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,980
Yeah, the Michael Jackson reference memo.

947
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,700
It starts off with, and you know, did you like Matt Farber?

948
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,060
I don't remember Matt Farber, particularly well.

949
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,260
Um,

950
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun of him.

951
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:59,380
You know, I, I did like him because he was really trying to keep the music alive on MTV.

952
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,380
He was a radio guy.

953
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,740
Was he the guy that had come from karaoke?

954
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,740
Yeah, I was.

955
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
Yeah.

956
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,020
He brought Kennedy then.

957
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,540
Yeah.

958
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,740
I don't, oh, that was the reason why why I didn't quite like him that much, I guess.

959
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,740
All right.

960
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740
Well, because we're about to make fun of him.

961
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,740
I just wanted to make sure he was somebody like him.

962
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,740
We like him.

963
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,740
We're honest here.

964
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,740
I like him.

965
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,740
Okay.

966
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
All right.

967
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,740
So the memo begins with here's a unique one.

968
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:30,740
We need to refer to Michael Jackson as the king of pop in quotes on air quote from time to time.

969
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,740
Here's how we'll handle this.

970
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:41,740
In VJ segments, each VJ should refer to Michael Jackson as the king of pop at least twice

971
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,220
in each VJ segment over the next week.

972
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,420
That's twice per segment per VJ for a week.

973
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,020
You had to say the king of pop.

974
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,500
I remember.

975
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,540
And then in specialty shows such as yo top 20 most wanted fade to black, et cetera, refer

976
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:07,740
to Michael Jackson as the king of pop at least once per show per week for the next two weeks.

977
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:13,180
Be sure to note exactly which segment you do this in as we will be sending dubs to the king

978
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,260
of pop himself.

979
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,300
I know this is a bizarre request, but Fox and BET are already doing this.

980
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,060
So we need to too.

981
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,060
But we can't play.

982
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
We can't play.

983
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,180
We can't blame him for that because that was a part of the deal that Michael Jackson made

984
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,180
with MTV for the video musical words.

985
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Yeah, I know.

986
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,180
But you don't know how this sentence I know how bizarre this request is, but Fox and BET are

987
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
already doing this.

988
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Dix in my cry.

989
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
How lame is that?

990
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Fox and BET are doing it.

991
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,180
We've got to do it too, my God.

992
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:53,180
Can't let me ask you a question because so I met Michael Jackson out in LA and I'd have to say

993
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,860
that if anything he's completely asexual, that was the vibe I got from him.

994
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,860
Do you think that he really did any of the things he's being accused of?

995
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,860
You know, I have to say I'm beginning to wonder.

996
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:10,860
I had thought for years that there was absolutely nothing to this, Michael Jackson, because

997
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,180
of his free-cish behavior.

998
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,860
And because of the fact that he gets himself into situations where there is certainly

999
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:23,420
possibility of improprietous behavior, if you know what I mean.

1000
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:29,420
He becomes, and because he was at one time incredibly wealthy became a sitting duck for target.

1001
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,420
You're saying he's not wealthy anymore?

1002
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,420
He's wealthy on paper, but he's got liquid financial problems.

1003
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
You don't know that.

1004
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,420
You can't look at his fucking bank account.

1005
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,420
You don't know that.

1006
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,420
Well, I'm saying that the news have reported that there are funny polls.

1007
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Thank you.

1008
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,420
The news.

1009
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,420
The quote news has reported.

1010
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
We watch entertainment tonight.

1011
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:55,420
He has to live, you know, one of the most extravagant expensive lifestyles of any

1012
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,420
human being on the planet.

1013
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,420
Oh, please.

1014
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,420
And aside from his holdings, he's not generating much cash other than his holdings of, you know,

1015
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
the various...

1016
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,420
Do you have any idea how much money he gets per year?

1017
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,420
I mean, that it's an astronomical amount, believe.

1018
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,420
I know, but I mean, I've actually seen reports where they were analyzing the spending

1019
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,420
and how much they don't know.

1020
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,420
But they don't know.

1021
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,420
That race never lands.

1022
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,420
Nobody knows that.

1023
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
Nobody knows that.

1024
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
It's costing.

1025
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,420
No one knows that shit.

1026
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
You can't look at someone's mind.

1027
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,420
You can't look in their pocketbook.

1028
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,420
No.

1029
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,420
Well, no.

1030
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,420
And that wasn't the point of the conversation.

1031
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,420
The point of the conversation was he was weird.

1032
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,420
And he was a very obvious, easy target for allegations of his nature.

1033
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,420
I look at this ridiculous court trial going on.

1034
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
And it really has turned into a three-ring circus.

1035
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,420
I think the judge is a lot of a whole bunch of crap to happen.

1036
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Yeah.

1037
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,420
But the judge is media horny.

1038
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
That's what he is.

1039
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,420
You know, we got X employees testifying.

1040
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Well, these are people who were fired and have a grudge.

1041
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,420
I don't know whether they're telling the truth or not.

1042
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:01,420
But there's so much money out there to be had by people that anybody is going to say anything.

1043
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,420
I think if they stand to make this kind of money off it.

1044
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,420
I really don't know.

1045
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
I just don't know.

1046
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,420
I always felt so strongly that no, it's just wasn't possible.

1047
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,420
But so many people and so many allegations.

1048
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,420
And there's so much similarity amongst the theme that it just...

1049
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,420
I don't know.

1050
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,420
I'm starting to wonder.

1051
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,420
Well, for me, he's innocent until proven guilty.

1052
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,420
And if I agree with that.

1053
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
And I do believe in the justice system.

1054
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,420
And if he turns out to be guilty, then okay, I'll be the first one to say I was wrong.

1055
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:39,420
But let's also not forget that this guy is one of the most talented musicians we've had in my generation.

1056
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,420
And he's also...

1057
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,420
He hasn't exhibited that in a long, long time.

1058
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,420
I disagree because he's written a lot of shit for other people.

1059
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,420
He's been doing a lot of stuff for other people.

1060
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,420
I had kept hoping for him, though, that he would one of these days in the past ten years,

1061
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,420
or so create another really brilliant record.

1062
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,420
It's impossible to do that when you're going through this shit.

1063
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,420
You can't be creative when that's happening to you.

1064
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,420
There's no fucking way.

1065
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
There's no way.

1066
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,420
Well, this this shit hasn't been going on the entire time.

1067
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,420
But he...

1068
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Long time no.

1069
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,420
We'll see what happens.

1070
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,420
I do agree in the criminal justice system as well.

1071
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,420
And the difference is between what I think and that is that that's beyond a benefit of it doubt.

1072
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,420
You can have a little teeny doubt, but that's not beyond the benefit of it doubt.

1073
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:30,420
I think there's some suspicion growing in me that some there's something weird going on.

1074
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,420
But a reasonable doubt is what it is, Kevin.

1075
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,420
It's beyond reasonable doubt.

1076
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:39,420
I still have reasonable doubts, so therefore I would that be enough to get him.

1077
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,420
Nope.

1078
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,420
Don't think so.

1079
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,420
Okay.

1080
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,420
He's also raised hundreds of millions of dollars for charity.

1081
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,420
No, that is absolutely true, too.

1082
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,420
I was always a staunch Michael Jackson defender.

1083
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,420
It's just been the last month or two.

1084
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,420
I've started to think that...

1085
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,420
I don't know.

1086
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,420
There was just...

1087
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,420
I'm with Haraldo, man.

1088
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,420
Haraldo's a lawyer.

1089
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,420
He's seen all the documents.

1090
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,420
He said his bullshit.

1091
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,420
I'd like Haraldo.

1092
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,420
Yeah, I like Haraldo.

1093
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,420
He was normally, I think, he's a jackass.

1094
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,420
No, Haraldo's only.

1095
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,420
I've always liked him.

1096
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
I've always liked him.

1097
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,420
You used to like him, though, because he had it.

1098
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,420
He'd be fluted in New York every day in his own helicopter.

1099
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,420
I had nothing to do with it.

1100
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,420
Nothing to do with it at all.

1101
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,420
That wasn't until much later.

1102
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,420
Nothing to do with it.

1103
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,420
While you were sitting in traffic in the roles.

1104
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,420
And you never had it in the helicopter.

1105
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,420
I had nothing to do with it.

1106
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,420
I always liked him.

1107
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,420
I thought I love watching his show.

1108
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,420
We still get fucked over here.

1109
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,420
I watch him all the time.

1110
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,420
He cracks me up.

1111
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:40,420
By the way, the car that the garage door fell on.

1112
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,420
You heard that story.

1113
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,420
I actually was brushing my teeth while I was listening to that story.

1114
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:52,420
It made me spit toothpaste all over my brand new high definition flat panel monitor.

1115
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,420
Was it the CRX or was it the Camaro?

1116
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,420
No, that was the Mitsubishi.

1117
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,420
Oh, the Mitsubishi, right?

1118
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,420
The Mitsubishi had about two months left on its lease.

1119
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,420
When I bought my first new Camaro, that was the Z28.

1120
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,420
That reminded me of a funny story.

1121
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,420
The night I picked up that Z28.

1122
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,420
And the Mitsubishi, I'll explain why the Mitsubishi was in the garage in a moment.

1123
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,420
But you got in that thing in a bathrobe.

1124
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,420
Do you recall?

1125
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,420
Yeah.

1126
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,420
And put that car up till like 75 to 80 miles an hour in a 25.

1127
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,420
And like five seconds.

1128
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,420
Well, I did it before, I think.

1129
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,420
And I was just envisioning the arrest of you.

1130
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,420
MTV and radio celebrity in a bathrobe.

1131
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,420
For doing 85 into 25 in my Z28.

1132
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,420
Didn't happen.

1133
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,420
It worked out.

1134
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,420
No, it was fine.

1135
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,420
And no, that wasn't the car that got teaboned.

1136
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,420
The car that got teaboned was in 2002.

1137
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,420
That I had SS that I had replaced the Z28 with.

1138
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,420
The car is at overlap.

1139
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,420
I still had like two months left on my lease of the Mitsubishi.

1140
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,420
And I only had one garage stall at my apartment in you for whatever reason.

1141
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,420
I think you had sold the Porsche.

1142
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,420
And one of the garage stalls there at the curry mansion was vacant.

1143
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,420
Yeah.

1144
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,420
The one that didn't work.

1145
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,420
Right.

1146
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,420
And so I had stored the Mitsubishi in the garage there for like two months until the lease was up.

1147
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,420
Oh, you were pulling it out.

1148
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,420
Was that it?

1149
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,420
You were pulling it out of the garage.

1150
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,420
That car was in perfect shape.

1151
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,420
I was supposed to be taking it back to Mitsubishi.

1152
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,420
The next day to turn it in at the end of its three year lease.

1153
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,420
Patricia was standing there in the driveway.

1154
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,420
I had somehow wedged.

1155
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,420
I knew the spring and the garage door didn't work.

1156
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,420
And it was a really heavy garage door.

1157
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:43,420
I had wedged a piece of wood or something in there that was supposed to prevent it from coming down.

1158
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,420
Yeah.

1159
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,420
And I got about halfway out of the garage.

1160
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,420
When Patricia, I heard her yell.

1161
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,420
And I saw the door starting to come down.

1162
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,420
I was in reverse.

1163
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,420
I floored it.

1164
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:58,420
I laid a huge smoker in the garage trying to like that.

1165
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,420
And I didn't get back far enough because that like 200 pound garage door went right dead center

1166
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,420
across the hood.

1167
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,420
Yeah.

1168
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,420
And put a huge dent in it.

1169
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,420
And the funny thing is, is I pounded that back out with a hammer.

1170
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,420
It looked awful.

1171
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,420
I took it back to Mitsubishi.

1172
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,420
And they said, thanks.

1173
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,420
They didn't even come out to the lot and look at it.

1174
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,420
Yeah.

1175
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,420
They like wrote me a check for my security deposit and I was out of there and goodbye.

1176
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,420
Nobody ever said a word about it.

1177
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,420
Oh, baby.

1178
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,420
That was the Mitsubishi.

1179
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,420
Yeah.

1180
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,420
I love that.

1181
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,420
And it is funny because I think even that day when I got out of the car and there was a huge dent.

1182
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,420
I mean, the garage door was stuck across the hood.

1183
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,420
There was smoke rolling out from, you know, the patch I had laid.

1184
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,420
I think Patricia.

1185
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,420
She was laughing.

1186
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,420
I bet she was laughing.

1187
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,420
She was laughing so hard at me.

1188
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,420
I bet.

1189
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,420
Because I had a fit.

1190
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,420
I really did have a fit.

1191
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,420
I was like, oh, no.

1192
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,420
But you're right.

1193
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,420
You know me and cars.

1194
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,420
Uh-huh.

1195
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,420
I couldn't help it.

1196
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,420
So do you have anything else we can wrap this one up?

1197
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,420
Because we're already at, like, what are we at now?

1198
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,420
Fort.

1199
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,420
Oh, I think we should probably wrap.

1200
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,420
That was the big stuff I had on the list for the day.

1201
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,420
I mean, you and I could talk about stuff all the time.

1202
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,420
We should do a theme next time.

1203
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,420
Like, you know, we still haven't talked about Joni Abbott.

1204
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,420
I promise myself.

1205
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,420
We're going to do that one of these things.

1206
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,420
We haven't talked about Joni Abbott.

1207
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,420
We haven't talked about Joni Abbott.

1208
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,420
So we talk about the dead people.

1209
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,420
Uh-huh.

1210
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,420
We haven't talked about Dabithis Ouron Burger.

1211
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,420
Oh, my God, crabatha.

1212
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,420
rabatha.

1213
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,420
Ah, my goodness.

1214
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,420
Nughoses up at five o'clock is it with Courader Crabby.

1215
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,420
Yes.

1216
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,420
And they say Cour'! Everybody be like, oh, I think God.

1217
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,420
Yeah.

1218
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,420
I call it.

1219
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,420
Yeah.

1220
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,420
I said it was with Crabby, everybody would be like, oh man.

1221
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,420
There was someone else who I heard from the other day, um.

1222
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:49,500
It was, um, God damn, I think another guy from the news department, he was kind of like a, he was a cool guy.

1223
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,620
He, um, it was Dave Serolnik, and there was someone else, there's not a Dave.

1224
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,660
I'm trying to think, Dave and Nupus, I remember Dave Serolnik.

1225
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,820
Yeah, that wasn't the one I should have kept my notes.

1226
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,820
So I don't know.

1227
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,660
I've got it.

1228
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,660
I'm sure on a memo.

1229
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,660
So I'm wearing trust me, but I'm some of my memories of everybody.

1230
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,660
You know, it's funny.

1231
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,180
I remember so many people, but when you go back, you know, even when I did that reunion,

1232
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,260
JJ thing, there were people I had completely forgotten about.

1233
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:21,900
You know, Chris Kelly, the stage manager and Chris Kelly, yeah, Chris Kelly was the

1234
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,500
stage manager for a long time.

1235
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,140
Then Jenna Rossitano became the, the pretty regular stage manager.

1236
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,500
She was cute.

1237
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,940
Jenna still stage managing Saturday night live, you know, because she was Beth's buddy, right?

1238
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,940
Um, yeah, Beth in this whole group.

1239
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,940
She's still directing of sure, right?

1240
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,940
But, saying Beth is directing.

1241
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,940
Beth is directing.

1242
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,860
Beth has been directing Saturday night live now for five, six years.

1243
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,860
Yeah.

1244
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,100
Um, but Jenna is there.

1245
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,980
There's a bunch of old MTV staffers that have gone over and are at Saturday night live.

1246
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,740
And I always say every time I go to New York, I'm going, I should get in touch with Beth

1247
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,860
in those guys, because that was the one, you know, one of the great things about working

1248
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,180
at MTV with all those years is that you get to go to all the cool places, you know,

1249
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,580
you get to go to the show tapings and the concerts and all that.

1250
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,980
But I never got to go to Saturday night live ever.

1251
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,980
Me neither.

1252
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,140
And we've got buddies there.

1253
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,380
Did you ever go to Saturday night?

1254
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,380
No.

1255
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,380
No.

1256
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,020
No, never did.

1257
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,940
So we should make a list of stuff to talk about next time.

1258
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,140
Well, you and I actually haven't had a conversation, you and I since the last time we did

1259
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,140
at MTV Chronicles.

1260
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,980
So yeah, I just don't want to have to brainstorm.

1261
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,980
That would require work.

1262
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:38,380
Like either of us have time between work and accidents and you running an empire

1263
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,140
affair from the English countryside.

1264
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,140
Yes, indeed.

1265
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,380
I'm glad you enjoyed the good at cheese shopping cards story too, by the way.

1266
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,380
The one.

1267
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,380
Oh, yeah, the good at shopping card.

1268
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,380
The shopping card full of good.

1269
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,380
Yep.

1270
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:57,380
Well, the cast is off my arm, so I can, I'm back to the, you get into the weirdos

1271
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,380
shit, my friend.

1272
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,380
You really do.

1273
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,980
Well, I, you know, but you, you said it yourself last week, I, I, I don't go out

1274
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:04,980
looking for it.

1275
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,980
It's just.

1276
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,980
It comes on to you.

1277
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,980
All right.

1278
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,980
Well, thank you.

1279
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,980
This is always fun.

1280
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,980
It's been good.

1281
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:12,980
Yeah.

1282
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,980
Good time.

1283
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,980
Tell me MTV again.

1284
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,860
And thank you for the, the plug there for the Ken and script show this last week.

1285
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,140
I haven't done a promo in a long time, but yeah, but something about getting an accident

1286
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,580
is inspiring to my creative juices.

1287
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,580
But I like it so much.

1288
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,180
I'd like it when you just talk about regular shit that's happened to you.

1289
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,180
That's funny, you know?

1290
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,820
That's real life seems to be funny.

1291
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,820
Typically it does.

1292
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,220
And I think that's pretty much what's going to happen this week as well, because I've

1293
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,820
gotten no big sticks or gigs, and we're not traveling, so.

1294
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,820
Okay.

1295
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,820
How's business out there, everything good?

1296
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,220
Oh, I am swamped in real estate right now.

1297
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:51,660
As soon as I booked an airplane ticket to Florida and gotten a car accident, I got swamped.

1298
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,660
I got seven pieces of business on my plate, and I've been working like 14 hour days,

1299
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,660
seven days a week.

1300
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,660
Right.

1301
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:04,080
It looks like it's going to be a banner, a banner spring from the accounting standpoint,

1302
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,820
and I'll just have to relax somewhere down the road when business slows down a little bit.

1303
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,820
Okay.

1304
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,820
You want to do some more.

1305
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,820
I'm having a lot of fun.

1306
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,820
You want to do some more of that.

1307
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,820
You want to have your Lord out.

1308
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,580
I'm actually off to Florida next week to spend a week at the parents house on the

1309
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,580
other side of Florida from where you guys go.

1310
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,580
Okay.

1311
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,920
Well, Patricia says hi, I couldn't get it to come up because Oman Opa just left and she was

1312
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,260
enjoying his soul when I know.

1313
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,620
Yeah, they were here for like while we were on vacation and they were here

1314
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,100
For what week we came back what Wednesday? I think yeah, we came back home in opera

1315
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:40,860
But Trisha's mom would always she was a very violent woman. She would always she still hits me like hit me

1316
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,860
So yeah, she hits me all the time

1317
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:51,300
I can just do his legs at first time. I met but Trisha's mom. She said you know can you look just like Jesus Christ

1318
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,300
And then she hit you

1319
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:02,980
All right, all right. Well, my love to the whole family back at you by and we'll do this again more sooner next time

1320
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,980
Okay, dokey

1321
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,980
Thank you. See you. Bye
