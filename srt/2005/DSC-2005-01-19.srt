1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is the source code for Wednesday, January 19th, 2005.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Transmators, we don't need no stinkin' transmators.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oncoming casting with Adam Curry.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It is Wednesday, January 19th, 2005.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Everybody, how you doing?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh man, this is gonna be a legendary podcast.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can feel it already, not just because I'm sitting on the couch today,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
using everything on the laptop, not hooked up to the monitor the keyboard in the mouse.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I am hooked up to the Firewire Breakout box, of course.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Power, power, power, power, power.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But we've got something celebrated, everybody.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's right, I got a can of Coke right here.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There you go.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And even though it is 11.36 in the AM,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sitting right underneath the window.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So it's not to leave any traces of the celebratory cigar.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I am smoking right now.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh yeah.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh yeah.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We got a lot to talk about today.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We're gonna listen some promos, some pod save music, some great covers.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
First, hold on, let's, let's, this is what I was looking for yesterday.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Um, let's see if we can get a little, uh, tympany role going here.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, because, as of yesterday afternoon,

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
the cottage is connected.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I got some broadband pipe right here on my laptop.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Baby, oh yeah.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And as a guest, you, uh, spark up yourself there.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A little terribly good some other stuff.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll be smoking that tonight as a celebration about it.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've got to tell you all about what happened.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It is unbelievable what has been going on.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And by the way, even though I have broadband in the house,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
as we speak, there's a guy outside digging a trench.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's just, it's unbelievable what's been happening.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm gonna place some phone calls for you so you can figure out exactly what went down.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But first, let's celebrate with the whole.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm free.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm free.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm free.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm free.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm free.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm free.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm free.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm free.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm free.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm free.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm free.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm free.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm free.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I used 22 gold, I won't have the guts to leave the temple

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm free, I'm free

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And freedom days of reality

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm free, I'm free

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm free, I'm free

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I'm waiting for you to follow me

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm free, I'm free

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm free, I'm waiting for you to follow me

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Come down to reality, it's the who on the daily source code

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And yesterday we'll go down as a great day in my life, that's for sure

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Tuesday the 18th

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Things started to happen as I really got into the British Telecom

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
EasyNet broadband issue, I was really getting upset

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now I recorded everything I did yesterday

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not going to play the bits where I called up BT

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and tried to re-explain everything to them

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not going to explain how I'm not going to play the bit where I called

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
EasyNet again and then went through a whole bunch of guys

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
until finally I was promised that a manager would call back

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
which he actually did

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but I do want to give you a couple of the bits where the magic started to happen

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
as I was at Starbucks and there's more to talk about

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
because it's not all good news

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
but I was at a hair appointment at

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
one of those guys named Sam and Dave

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, that's Sam and Dave

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Tony and Guy, apparently they're all over the world now

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
these hair slons and it's a very very hip hair slons

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So Patricia went with me down to Guilford to the town

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I went into Sam and I'm going to call him Sam and Dave

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
went into Sam and Dave's

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and she opened a book and said this is what I wanted

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
his hair to look like and she then left

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
as I went off to Starbucks to go and upload yesterday's source code

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So Matt Starbucks, the phone rings

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and of course I fumble as much as I can

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and I hit the record button because

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
well you can't hit the record button until

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the connection has actually been made

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you can't do it while the phone is ringing

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
either it's ringing on my end on the other end

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I saw that it was a cell phone though

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and I figured that might be someone who's trying to help me out

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
so I picked it up

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is the British telecom engineer who came out to the house

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and well you heard it

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
they made a right mess of the whole order he said

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
hey yeah right

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think it's in the job notes here

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
that the telecom number

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that's the job that I've got

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
he's full of knowledge

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
residential lines

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
yeah it's that already working in solar premises

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
yeah that's been working

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
every since we moved in which was two months ago

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
so yeah that's the second one that's been created

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
see there's another confusion here still

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you're just having one line in the premises

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
no this this is the second line

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because apparently

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
there is no wiring to run two lines

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
there's no existing wiring to run two lines

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
so basically here I'm going through

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
explaining this but I figured here's a guy

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
who actually cares and is trying to help me out

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and is admitting that BT is fucked it up

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the wiring is there at the house part

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
let me fast forward a bit let me just see

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
well I'll tell you let me let me give you the whole history

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and maybe that'll give you some

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
oh no we don't want the whole history

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
well you couldn't

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
what you could do

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
yeah help

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
bring the doorbell my wife is home

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and she knows that you're there

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and she'll take you up to the room

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and she'll make you feel very happy

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
if you give her husband broadband

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
where the box is there's a number on the box

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
on the

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it's like it's not a telephone

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
so basically I went through

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
explanations there let's just get the end of this call here

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you can find out what nerf is going on here

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and see if we can get some form of light

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to get the job really raised properly

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
because I can't do anything

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
without a job for you and make the BT won't do it

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
right

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the line test okay so I got the wrong number

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
they put you down here first line

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
which is a full full nine six

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sure that line works fine

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
it's probably busy because we're dialed into the

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
internet all day so I'll come down

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to this go on a full for January then

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
yes yes exactly

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll try and sort something out for you

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll give you a call back show

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and I really appreciate the calls back

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that's the only thing I really asked for

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
just to be letting me know

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll see if I can get to the bottom of this for you

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
okay thank you

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
thank you

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
so I reviewed this phone call like wait a minute

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
there's something really funky going on

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
because British telecom thinks that

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
our normal house line which you heard

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
starts with 449

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
that that was

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
essentially the line that they were testing

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
so they were testing the the wrong number entirely

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and getting proper tests but now

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
what does that mean does that mean

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that that original line was broad band enabled

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
so that was pretty confusing

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
then literally seconds after that I get a call

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
from easy net

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
hello hello hello is Adam

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
yes speaking oh hello Adam is

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Adam from meeting that calling

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
hi I just been speaking to to fill

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and we're actually dealing with this case

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
on Friday but unfortunately

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
look like nobody's actually updated

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
what has actually been done

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
yeah um we've um

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I spoke to the the LLU manager actually

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that's rechargeable these lines on Friday

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and that basically what's happening

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
is they reopen the job for provisioning

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
engineer to come back out and actually

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
get the the piece of cable

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is actually missing

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and um I think there were

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think there were hoping to try and do that

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
today but obviously we thought they have

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and I just told the manager that

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
unfortunately she wasn't available so I've left

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the message with her

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
but I'll try and I'll try and get back to

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
as soon as I found out a bit more

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
okay so at this point I'm like all right

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
this guy's pretty good you know and I went

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
through a couple bits of history with him

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll fast forward to the end of this call as well

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
just kidding he's pretty me

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
which is even more number there

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
to call in case I needed some more

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
or had some info for him actually

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
three

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
okay um if we at least can keep each other updated

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
on whatever status then you know

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
that's going to be a step in the right direction

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
yeah definitely

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
because this is just this is driving me crazy

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
yeah and also no surprise yeah

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
okay so

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
when when this guy calls me back

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll let you know what he says and what he's

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
figured out okay if you don't

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
if you hear anything please give me a call

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
good deal then okay thanks

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
thank you bye

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
okay so um I was feeling a little bit

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
bit about that phone call

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and then minutes later and remember

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm still sitting at Sart

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
hold on

226
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the drunken bit

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm still sitting at Starbucks

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and then the BT engineer calls me back

229
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
how are you?

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
hello not safe at how would you

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
feel if I could put proof and on your

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
phone call

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
do you like men kissing you

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
with that work

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
yeah what are you going to tell me all about it

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
what I've got is basically what we just discussed

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but is exactly the problem and nobody can pick up

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
this number that you've got written on the

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
socket because it's very easy

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
right so basically what we're going to do is

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm going to put you an extension socket

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
right next to that other one

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
yeah all right

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
if you're talking to that when you get home

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you should be able to sign

246
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
straight on to free BT

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
all right this is I'm like

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
whoa wait a minute

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
so he's got broadband enabled now

250
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
on the original house line which

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
means somehow a port freed up

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
or BT freed up a port

253
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and connected my regular line to

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
ADSL I'm like

255
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
huh boy

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
so we've hooked up and ready to go

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
well that's certainly a great

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
solution for now yes

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
yeah

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
the only problem I've got is whether you

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
have to actually sign straight on to it

262
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you may well have to sign up

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
sales on one five zero

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
so it's the point my brain is going

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
a thousand miles admitted I'm like

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
god damn I never ordered broadband

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
through British telecom because they have

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
a metered servers you only get like

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
twenty megs or twenty gigs a month

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm like well but shit you know I'll take anything at this point

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
right so

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and I knew that oh man it's going to be a pain in the

273
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
past have to go sign on and get everything

274
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
working through British telecom because you know

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
they're going to be like who? how can you have the line already

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
but not have an order and a log on

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
well then to

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
locate you on the line all right

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
but so that's so that's

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
so I'll be on BT broadband now

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
an easy net that's right yeah

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
it's that kind

283
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
well it's certainly fixed it for now but obviously

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
easy net's going to have to figure out their

285
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
problems and get that right right

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
more batteries about the dollar

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
or something on the phone so much

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll do that for you now I'll get the extension

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and if you plug into that and log on to

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
no you should find you'll be up and run

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I appreciate it

292
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
all right okay thank you very much

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
fine well so even though I got that message yesterday

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I wasn't about to post that on the web

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
log or put it in any kind of show yet because I'm like

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
well I don't know what that means so

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I went home

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
plugged in I still had the

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
router from UK online

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the original provider who I

301
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
who I'd contacted because they have

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
a unmetered service you can download

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
as an upload as much as you want

304
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
although it's not you know for

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
megabits per second as easy net I'm like

306
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
oh shit so I went back and I

307
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
didn't call BT broadband I called

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
UK online

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
explain the situation now this by the way

310
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
is I think the residential arm

311
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
of easy net and

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
immediately they said oh no problem

313
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I said look I see the light

314
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
on I know that my account was cancelled

315
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I got put through to an engineer

316
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
within three seconds he helped me configure

317
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the router out of change one parameter

318
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
from 38 to 35 or something

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and bingo

320
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was connected

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and the first person actually to

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
notice it was Steve Gilmore

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
he sent me a Skype message

324
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
which I didn't see until this morning

325
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
said look I've seen you pop up on

326
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Skype twice today does that mean

327
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
broadband has arrived at the cottage

328
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
so indeed

329
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
he was right

330
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and it was working last night

331
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and I've been you know I

332
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
potters been running for hours

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I've been listening to shit I've been

334
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
able to go through my email

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and get all kinds of you know

336
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
promos and sound songs and

337
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
sound sing tours and stuff that

338
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
y'all have been emailing me

339
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and then the morning as I was

340
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
in the car taking Christina to school

341
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Patricia calls up and she says well

342
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
he's got his digging tools

343
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
do I let him dig and I said fuck yeah

344
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
let the man dig so the guy is

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
let me just see

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
he's still outside digging

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I have the window open so you'll probably

348
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
hear some digging sounds and his equipment

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
one guy he's been here since

350
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
he's right now it's 10 to 12 he's been here since

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
shoot

352
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
quarter to nine this morning

353
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
just about nine o'clock

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
he's been here for almost three hours

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
even though the comments on the

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
weblog suggested you know you should

357
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
give me a cup of coffee or tea

358
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I've offered him more than that

359
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
obviously by the way the beat the

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
bt engineer that was here yesterday

361
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Patricia really laid into him and

362
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
unfortunately she and Ivana Roxy

363
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
her sister's daughter

364
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
have gone off to London today

365
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
otherwise Patricia would have gladly told

366
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
me the story and told you the story

367
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
so I'll get her on tomorrow

368
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
because she has to talk about a couple

369
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
of them missed all of this joy

370
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
this just fantastic great news

371
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Tony and guy fucked up my hair

372
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
my head looks like a knob

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
momentarily it's not pretty at all

374
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
they cut it way too short I didn't

375
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
my glasses on and I look horrible

376
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
no pictures please and we'll have

377
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Patricia talk about that tomorrow as well

378
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
because well you know about her

379
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and the curries right so

380
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
we'll have an interesting show

381
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll make sure I get Patricia on the show tomorrow

382
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
oh shit no I can't get on the show tomorrow

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
because I'm flying to Amsterdam

384
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Kaka

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
right then maybe Friday or maybe Monday

386
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
will have to see

387
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but it doesn't matter

388
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
because you know and the girls are

389
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
cracking jokes on my hair you know

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the same oh well you know it'll grow back

391
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
all the crappy things you say to someone

392
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
who's a hair got fucked

393
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and actually it's a very English kind of

394
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
looking hairdo you know so

395
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I guess it kind of fits the

396
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the area but no it was it was not

397
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
what I wanted unfortunately

398
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
doesn't matter though I was like I don't

399
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
fucking care I could be bald

400
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I got my god damn broad band

401
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
hi Adam Matthew Bishop here

402
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
your fact guy

403
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I've got an interesting page here

404
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
at Skype.com it's at Skype.com

405
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
slash helps slash guides

406
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
messaging all on word.html

407
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and it has a whole explanation

408
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
of the voice messaging system

409
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
you should go check it out

410
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
the invites are called vouchers

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and they're available on the my account page

412
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
you probably would have gotten an email

413
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
but they're going to slowly phase out

414
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
voice messaging and I can tell here

415
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
from the page in one of the last FAQs

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
let's see

417
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
or actually maybe

418
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
yeah here the second FAQ question

419
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
how much will voice messaging cost

420
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and then the answer from Skype

421
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
is exact pricing details

422
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
have yet to be finalized

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
you'll be informed of the subscription

424
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
cost before the trial ends

425
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
so it will not be free

426
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but as you said you'd be willing to pay

427
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
for some extra features and voice mail

428
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and I'm hoping recording

429
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
will be some of those features

430
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
there's also a question how can I invite

431
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
friends to join Skype voice messaging

432
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and it says once we are ready to expand

433
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
our testing you will see a link

434
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
in my account page where you can invite new users

435
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
so invitations are hopefully on the way

436
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I know I didn't get an email

437
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
from Skype but I would love to get one as well

438
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
another interesting thing is that

439
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
you can leave messages for people who are offline

440
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and they'll receive them

441
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
once they're online

442
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and you can create your own

443
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
status message

444
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and there's an option for

445
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm looking at a screenshot

446
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
when I reject an incoming call

447
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
send call to voice mail

448
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
or play busy tone

449
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
or another option is

450
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
when I'm in a call

451
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
send incoming call to voice mail

452
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and then there's an idol if I don't answer

453
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
within certain number of seconds

454
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
so go check it out

455
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Skype.com slash help slash guys

456
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
thank you very much Matthew

457
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
my fact guy appreciated

458
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
apparently only windows users

459
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and select windows users

460
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
received an invitation from Skype to use

461
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
voice mail

462
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Mac people are not included in the trial

463
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but looking forward to that

464
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I would definitely buy that service from Skype

465
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I've actually ordered one of those

466
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
cordless Skype phones

467
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
because I want to

468
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I have to admit I'm also in the

469
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
in the throes of getting a windows machine

470
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
for downstairs

471
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the Skype wireless phone is great

472
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you just plug it into a USB port on the phone

473
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and I'm going to give Patricia

474
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Skype account and in the hand set itself

475
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
which can also be used

476
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
wireless to use your regular phone

477
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
line in coming and outgoing

478
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
you see your buddy list right there

479
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
in the phone is to who's online

480
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
who's on Skype and it's going to be great

481
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
because now I think the Skype global

482
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
call-out rate is

483
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
1.7 euro since per

484
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
per minute

485
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
which is oh god that's so much cheaper

486
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
than the regular BT phone line

487
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
now you don't have an incoming

488
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
but it really doesn't matter for the type of

489
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
phone calls that we're doing

490
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
excuse me

491
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
too much excitement too much coke and too much

492
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
of the cigar

493
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
lots of people responding

494
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
about sound seeing

495
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
it's so good now

496
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that I am setting up a domain

497
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and thank you all very much multiple people

498
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
have registered

499
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
variations of sound seeing

500
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
dot com sound seeing tours

501
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
sound scape and what's beautiful about

502
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
you know

503
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
donating these domain names to me

504
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
which is fucking awesome so I'm going to

505
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
create a new site

506
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and all of those domain names will

507
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
point to it to that new site

508
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
hold on

509
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and

510
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm basically just going to put up

511
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
MP3's to great sound seeing tours

512
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I guess I'm not quite sure how I'm going to do it

513
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
there will be a podcast feed of course

514
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and I've received a couple of

515
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
see I put these in the show notes for today

516
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and it's actually put up a

517
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
great fucking system

518
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the mob casting and bush protest

519
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
to blogspot.com websites

520
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and he's tricked out

521
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
audio blogging.com

522
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and blogspot.com

523
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
combining it with feed burner

524
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
to create some kind of automatic

525
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
system that

526
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
lets you call a phone number

527
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
hit a pin code

528
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
record something and then it shows up

529
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
in the RSS feed and the podcast feed

530
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
site so

531
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
the bush protest clearly is for

532
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
the inauguration and the mob casting

533
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
is his first experiment

534
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
with a mob casting tool

535
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
so check those out. I've asked him

536
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
for technical details which I'm sure he'll

537
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
give us loads of know how we can set that up

538
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
because that is very cool and I love it

539
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
when you can tie a couple of services together

540
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
because that's shit that's pretty much

541
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
how I started with iPotter

542
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and then another one came in

543
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll just play a little bit

544
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
a bit from Alan Joyce

545
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
who did a sound scene to work inside

546
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
office depot

547
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
let me say it

548
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
what was really cool is he

549
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
when over to the problems or

550
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
static or what

551
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I wonder what it was that I was doing

552
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
with that microphone on my

553
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
front

554
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
yeah

555
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
it's a handset

556
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
right here's some

557
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
sates

558
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
let's get back to the digital stuff

559
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
okay

560
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
so not bad actually any

561
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
in that particular sound scene

562
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
to we talked about the microphone

563
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that he used

564
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
which actually sounds pretty damn good

565
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
so again all of that linked as usual

566
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
from the production show

567
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
for today's podcast

568
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and buyer and lease sent me an email

569
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Adam really love the idea of sound

570
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
seeing especially since I'm legally blind

571
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
think it's cool when sighted people experience

572
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
the world through sound

573
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
the world I would like to thank you for getting

574
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
people excited about sound seeing

575
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
like to ask you if you could start a note on i

576
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
potter for sound seeing

577
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
definitely consider it done

578
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
thanks for taking me around Gilford and south floor to keep it up

579
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
maybe we can go on a tour in the Netherlands next week

580
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
yes this week we're going to do a tour

581
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
totally

582
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I was thinking about

583
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
doing the easy jet tour but i'm not going to be a

584
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
big pain in the fucking ass with you know i got

585
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
transmitters and recording devices and everything

586
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
is not allowed so maybe i'll pick it up at

587
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
it's people airport or something like that

588
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
or maybe i don't know we'll have to see

589
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
definitely want to do some more sound seeing for you

590
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
because people love it you know this is

591
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
a part of a threat of podcasting that is catching on so

592
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
shit let's give the people what they want

593
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
definitely we'll start a a

594
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
a note in the i potter.org directory

595
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
James Carter says hey Adam love the show

610
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
for god haven't prepared

611

612
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
if you hadn't already figured out

613
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
by the wacky music bed

614
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000

616
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000

new podcast

of course you can find all the new podcast

648
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and i potter.org

649
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
new ones are launched on the home page

650
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and of course they're automatically

651
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
filed away in the

652
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
the directory which you can get to

653
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
from the link podcast directory

654
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and of course don't forget audio.weblogs.com

655
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
that's the place where new podcast

656
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
that have just been released

657
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
so not necessarily a new podcast

658
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
you can subscribe to but

659
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
new ones that have just been thrown out

660
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
into the potter sphere

661
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
where you can check them out

662
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
so an XML button there where you can

663
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
copy that podcast feed

664
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000

665
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I had got a promo in

666
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
from podcast Paul

667
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and he had some music playing the background

668
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
which was by an out-of-called

669
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
dynamo rhythmases

670
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000

671
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
an MP3 well of course

672
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
mentioning that just once on the source code was enough

673
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and yeah you bet you here are the dynamo rhythmases

674
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,960
I immediately started to make all kinds of Skype out calls.

740
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
I talked to Lee Ann Wester.

741
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Lee Ann from the Sylvia's Bitties.

742
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
They were having a band meeting.

743
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,960
That evening, yesterday evening,

744
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
about the first Bitties podcast.

745
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
And so we talked a little bit about that.

746
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Man, those girls are great.

747
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
They are my angels from Nueva York.

748
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
I love them.

749
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
I love them.

750
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
And I guess sometime around February,

751
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,960
I'll probably be in New York and going to San Francisco

752
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
to the Wired Rave Awards.

753
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,960
I'd like to swing by there and check out the scene.

754
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Who knows where else we'll wind up.

755
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,960
But definitely, it'll be time for an America trip.

756
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Round midfab.

757
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
It's going to be busy month actually.

758
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Got a lot to do.

759
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Who else had talked to?

760
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Told you to talk to Drew, right?

761
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,960
I was supposed to have a call with Mad Weinstein.

762
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
But it was too late,

763
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,960
because she doesn't get off work until 6pm,

764
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
which would have been midnight here.

765
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
And I was just so happy.

766
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
And I've been bouncing around so much.

767
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
I fell asleep around 11.

768
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,960
So that's a call I'm going to make later on today.

769
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
But it's just great.

770
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
It's great to be back.

771
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
It's great to have bandwidth.

772
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
And you know, come up with all these cool things

773
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
that have been sent to me.

774
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
As I said earlier in an email,

775
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
which I just haven't been able to get to.

776
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
You know, kind of overlooked because I saw.

777
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Oops, that's five mags.

778
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
You know, let me calculate.

779
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
That's, uh,

780
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
Oh, that's going to be about 25 minutes,

781
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
30 minutes to download.

782
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,960
And I'm actually having to relearn how to click on stuff.

783
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I said, yeah, I can look at that.

784
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Yes, I can listen to that.

785
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Yes, it will be here almost immediately.

786
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
It's kind of like, you know,

787
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
being constipated for a couple of weeks.

788
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
And then, you know,

789
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,960
and then having a full release.

790
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Well, now let's see what the guy is doing outside.

791
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Oh, man.

792
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
That's a bigger job.

793
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
And I thought it was actually to be quite honest.

794
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,960
And by the way, I went out and when I bought him his coffee,

795
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
he just lays down the pipe.

796
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,960
He doesn't actually do the connections.

797
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,960
So I have to see how long it takes before that shows up.

798
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Here's something cool.

799
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,960
A lot of complaints about people not being able to see

800
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,960
the Steve Jobs keynote of late in real time

801
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,960
when he was introducing the iPod Mini.

802
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Sorry, let me say that right.

803
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,960
The shuffle and the Mac Mini.

804
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,960
But there's a solution to that.

805
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,960
The solution is something that Brian storms put together

806
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
or is it Brian storms.

807
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,960
That would be the Steve Jobs keynote in 60 seconds.

808
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,960
And it's not incredible.

809
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
It's not incredible.

810
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
It's really beautiful.

811
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
And I am thrilled.

812
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
And I am thrilled.

813
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
Really easy to do.

814
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Not incredible.

815
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Not incredible.

816
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Your power is free.

817
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,960
It's very, very tiny.

818
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,960
And it's in a building that's owned by the crown.

819
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Anyway, we can really screw up music this way.

820
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,960
And it is spectacular.

821
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,960
It's not incredible.

822
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Your mortals can set this up.

823
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,960
And you can do almost anything.

824
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
And it is spectacular.

825
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
It's not incredible.

826
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
You're going to search for love.

827
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,960
It's really unique.

828
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,960
It's in a building that's owned by the crown.

829
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Anyway, we can really screw up music this way.

841
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
We know from real reviews.

842
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Great radio.

843
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Oh, man.

844
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Excuse me.

845
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Oh, let me get rid of this thing in my throat.

846
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
There we go.

847
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Oh, God, sorry.

848
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Right, oh.

849
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
What are we at now?

850
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
34 minutes.

851
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Okay.

852
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Good timing is almost perfect today.

853
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
I guess I said emails.

854
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,960
This one's from before Christmas, December 23rd from Peter Gyros,

855
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,960
who sent me a nice email sympathizing with my dial-up woes.

856
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Oh, I'm all over that now, my friend.

857
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,960
But he created something so freaking beautiful.

858
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,960
And today is a day where you got the fever and the only thing they can cure

859
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
is more cowbell.

860
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Back to the reverb.

861
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
So the reverb is basically off.

862
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,960
However, I have added some more cowbell.

863
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,960
I think that makes the show much better.

864
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Don't you?

865
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,960
I think that makes the show much better.

866
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Don't you?

867
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,960

I think that makes the show much better.

919
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
I think that makes the show much better.

920
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
I think that makes the show much better.

921
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
I think that makes the show much better.

922
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,960
I can never have too much cal but oh hey.

923
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
I'll call.

924
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
I'll call.

925
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I'll call.

926
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I think that makes the show much better.

927
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
I think that makes the show better.

928
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,960
You can never have too much cal but oh hey.

929
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
I'll call.

930
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
I can never have too much cal but oh.

931
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
I can never have too much cal but oh hey.

932
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
I can never have too much cal but oh hey.

933
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,960
too much cowbelly, but basically...

934
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm sorry. That really sucked.

935
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,960
That's just no good. We're going to have to do that again, I'm sorry.

936
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
You know what I need right now?

937
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
You know what I really need?

938
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
Put your hands on your iPod or your N.D.

939
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Reware at this moment, my brothers and sisters.

940
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Have to do more cowbell.

941
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,960
You're right, Ambex selfish.

942
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,960
But the last time I checked, we don't have a whole lot of songs to feature the cowbell.

943
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Yes, what? I got a fever.

944
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,960
And the only prescription is more cowbell.

945
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:53,960
And the only prescription is more cowbell.

946
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:10,720
That's the dumb somkin cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell Cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbell cowbellows

947
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,160
the other day. That's such an awesome mix. Mashup makes whatever you want to call it. Thank you very much. That's great.

948
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,840
Oh, yeah. A lot of people emailed me. Of course, the song don't know much about history.

949
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,480
Don't know much about biology. Don't know much about science book. Don't know much about the French I took.

950
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,440
Was by Sam Cook. Of course. And I looked at my iTunes. I still don't have it. And an email as we wind up

951
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:42,320
today's show. Just a couple more things I want to hit on. This is from Randall. Is it from Randall?

952
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,120
Yeah. Adam, your podcast was 42 minutes yesterday. My community commute to work 20 minutes.

953
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,720
Yesterday, after 20 minutes of your podcast, I parked my 4 by 4. Shut everything off a continued listening.

954
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,840
A lady parked next to me and proceeded to change her shirt. I got that cool,

955
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,080
Brazier shot. Thanks to the source code. Never can tell what good things will happen to those who listen.

956
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,000
Buying. Yeah. Excellent. Of course, I was looking for the picture attachment, but that unfortunately was nowhere to be found.

957
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,640
And hello, Les Pozen. How you doing? Good morning, Australia.

958
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,640
I had a Les Pozen in Melbourne, Australia. Just to mention it, my first podcast is up there.

959
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,080
It's a suicide podcast, which means I'm looking at research and publications and items of interest in

960
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,960
the general media. I am that psychologists and anyone with an interest in psychology.

961
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,000
The aim is to bring people up to date with their new research and provide them with links on my webpage.

962
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,600
Give the podcast short about 20 minutes. Thanks for inspiration and thanks for your assistance.

963
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,240
And okay, from IT Conversations, this is also an intimate assistance by letting me put up some

964
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,600
short snippets from some of the IT Conversations of relevance. I hope you get a chance to listen.

965
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,680
I'll catch you another time. Thanks for your help.

966
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,040
Alright, buddy. My pleasure. And I hope to get to Australia one of these days.

967
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,560
Because there's a lot of good, good vibes going on down under with the podcasting.

968
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,800
One last thing I promised I do. I promised I'd call Wing Commander William.

969
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,800
My flight instructor about the new Airbus A380. I said,

970
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
yeah, and actually I'm trying to hook up with him tomorrow to do a little bit of flying in his new

971
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,000
Sess No 182. Which may work out if he doesn't have a pain customer, right?

972
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,360
Because all I have to do is pay for gas essentially in coffee and sandwiches.

973
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,720
I said, you know, William. So what's the deal with this thing? He said, oh man, this thing is awesome.

974
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,080
So but, you know, it's like, what kind of airfield do we need to land this fucker? He says, Adam,

975
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,400
this plane compared to a 747 has longer range uses less fuel,

976
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,320
can carry almost twice as many people and uses a shorter runway.

977
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,840
God, and I said, but dude, you know, it's like all it has to happen is for one of these things to fall

978
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,080
out of the sky and you know, 800 people get killed at once and that'll be the end of it. He said,

979
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:04,080
dude, it can only be an act of terrorism. He says, these things will not fall out of the sky.

980
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,800
There's so redundant at these are so modern. These planes are just awesome.

981
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,720
So there you have it from the Wingman, the Wing Commander himself. He certainly would know.

982
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,480
And I was just blown away by the fact that it has a shorter runway necessity.

983
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,960
I said, well, so, you know, what's that? He said, well, you know, airbus, the French, and the English,

984
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,120
and everyone really fucked Boeing. He said, but you watch out, those guys are going to come back

985
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,200
with something pretty heavy with their own super jet. So the race is on.

986
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,440
When I'm in the kitchen, I'll take it up. I'll take it up. I'll take it up.

987
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,440
I'll use the easy listening. I'll make it be loud. I'll take it up.

988
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,000
Morning, noon, and night.

989
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
Good night, internet.

990
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,960
That's it for your source code for Wednesday, January 19th. It's just fun.

991
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,440
And I'll gladly see you back tomorrow, probably on a sound scene tour of the Netherlands.

992
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,760
Thank you all for checking in. Thank you all very much for living with me for the past two months.

993
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,680
As I've been strapped down by bandwidth constraints,

994
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,920
living on the motor, we're back on broadband.

995
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,160
It'll probably take until next week, until the easing at Fat Fat Life is up.

996
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
But hey, I've got some going now.

997
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,000
So, we'll have to run noon here on Wednesday afternoon. So, I'm going to upload this show

998
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,040
from the convenience and comfort of the cottage.

999
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,760
It's all as comments out of Maccurry.com.

1000
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,880
If you got some really big descend, like a big SMP3 file sent that to my Gmail account,

1001
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,840

1004
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,240
Talk to you tomorrow, everybody. Bye-bye.
