00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charly 227

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You're DJ!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm your DJ!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your DJ has only just begun

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
August 24th, 2005, your daily source code is on

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The power of your head, though everybody

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Earlier today, as promised, it is now only a quarter to two in the afternoon

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, I'm going to have a much more energetic show

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I've actually created an outline

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And I've got all my stuff all prepped today

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ran through the whole mailbox, lots of stuff to catch up on

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The power of your head is coming

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Boy, did we ever make a good decision yesterday

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To not stay overnight and fly back this morning

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Whether it's total crap, we've got high winds, we've got low visibility

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And let your aim

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
As we say in aviation, the rock is wet

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And I can't see it

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So it's a perfect day to kind of

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Mellow around the house, get ready for the big podcast

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Complex move

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Remember, that's the big, the big desk that was built for me

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So I got to rearrange the room, get ready for it tomorrow

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
On today's source code, of course, I'm not saying music

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Obviously plenty of promos want to talk about the promos as well

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And some of the way that we're setting up hot show

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And different avenues for you to get the word out

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
About your podcast that we can really start promoting these

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And make sure that we can get those 100 million listeners

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And when they do show up, give us some of the lessons too

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I also want to talk about teenagers

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, we got one, 14 that's turning 15 on Saturday

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I just want to spew some parental stuff about that

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We'll get to that in a second

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The first it's time to roll out a mashup

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is actually it's an agro one week on mashup.com

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think I mentioned that yesterday

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So art has been sending me all the latest agro one mashups

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And he also has following on and yesterday's source code

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He has some ideas about how to get some of the creators of these wonderful mashups

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So I'm going to keep you able to speed on that

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's going to send me all the plans

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Here's turn out the car lights on the source code

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, it's time to slow on only inside this bed

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
To blow a patch of it, my little slave was making it, it's good

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We're gonna make it inside my head

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's gonna be your better run for it

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's the midnight

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm running like a devil city

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you're wondering something

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So easy to tell the problems

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's so easy to play a little breakdown

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's so easy to fly through a window

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's a bad, brilliant day

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because it can't be ready for a change

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I didn't make it by the world

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I didn't feel it

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If it's half day low, if it's half as close

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, if it's willing, no

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But as a midnight

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm running like a devil city

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you're wondering something

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So easy to tell the problems

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's so easy to play with the sound

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's so tough to get up

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's so tough

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's so tough

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's so tough to get up

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's so tough to get up

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's so tough to get up

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's so tough to get up

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's so tough to get up

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's so tough to get up

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's time to say the truth

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
When you hear that, you can't see you

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I asked you on the book, tell me your name

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Number two to the court

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can't do it on my whole life

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can't do it on my whole life

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm burning up, burning up, burning up

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm burning up, burning up

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can't do it on my whole life

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You can't do it on my whole life

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can't do it on my whole life

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You can't do it on my whole life

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can't do it on my whole life

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You can't do it on my whole life

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You can't do it on my whole life

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can't do it on my whole life

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can't do it on my whole life

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can't do it on my whole life

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can't do it on my whole life

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm going to come back and see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you see you when you

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:41,020
you when the you see you when you see you when you see you when you see sort of you and see me.

108
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,780
and see me then see me.

109
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,020
and see me.

110
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,300
and see me.

111
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
you just keep me trembling

112
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
I'll open the next scene

113
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
and solve the time

114
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
you

115
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,300
turn out the car light

116
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
cars moving in stereo

117
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
versus Nelly Furtado's

118
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
turn out the light mashed up by Agro1

119
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
you heard it here

120
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
on the source code

121
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
mashuptown.com is where I came from

122
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
thanks to a dub art

123
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
over there and

124
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
very curious art

125
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
to hear what ideas you have

126
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
for against beer money

127
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
to the people or more

128
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
perhaps

129
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
and to the artists as well

130
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
who are all part of these

131
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
mashups because so much

132
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
fun

133
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
you know, it's such a

134
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
cultural thing

135
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
we have all these tools

136
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
we can mash things together

137
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
but we don't have any legal way

138
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
to share them

139
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
so any thoughts on that

140
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
would be very, very cool

141
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
apologies for yesterday's source code

142
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
for the iTunes

143
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
subscribers

144
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
you probably have it by now

145
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
so you have two shows

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
to listen to today

147
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
there's just too many steps

148
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
in the freaking process

149
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
to get a podcast up

150
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
you know

151
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I'm uploading to three

152
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
different servers

153
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
creating

154
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
you know

155
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,300
making sure RSS files

156
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
are in the right place

157
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
and the naming conventions

158
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,300
this should be dragon

159
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
drop shit

160
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,300
I'm telling you

161
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
this is we actually have a

162
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
meeting today

163
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
where we're discussing

164
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
podcast

165
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
alice functionality

166
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
podshow

167
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
indie potter.org

168
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
how we're bringing it all together

169
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
and what pieces will be for listeners

170
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
what pieces will be for podcasters

171
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
and one thing for sure

172
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
when we come out with

173
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
with our full

174
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
blown offering for podcasters

175
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
it's got to be real simple

176
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
you know

177
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
I like the idea of just one button

178
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
boom

179
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
it's done

180
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,300
show notes are taken care of

181
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,300
they're posted

182
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
RSS feeds are done

183
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
uploads are done

184
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
and that's what computers

185
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,300
are for I think

186
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
right

187
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
that's

188
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
yeah I thought computers

189
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
actually were supposed to

190
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
make it life easier

191
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
I got to get back

192
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,300
into apple scripting stuff

193
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,300
you know

194
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,300
that's

195
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
which is of course

196
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
how the original iPod or script started

197
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
was just frustration

198
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
and apple script

199
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
actually

200
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
I just need some time

201
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
maybe the next trip

202
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
over to San Francisco

203
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,300
when I'm on

204
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
on the plane

205
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
I'll play around with

206
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
what does that thing called

207
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
it's

208
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
what is that new thing

209
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
in tiger

210
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
that

211
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
events or whatever

212
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,300
the events manager

213
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,300
anyway

214
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
it's

215
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
a way to create

216
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
apple scripts

217
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
simply by driving

218
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
drag and drop

219
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
and

220
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
probably with some tweaking

221
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
I'll be able to get some stuff

222
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
done so

223
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
that'll be just

224
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
for my personal benefit

225
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
I see we have so much to talk about today

226
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,300
on the way

227
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
promos

228
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
I want to talk about that

229
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
I run through the mail bag

230
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,300
because there's a lot of

231
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
backlog of e-mail stuff

232
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
that I wanted to talk about

233
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
also yesterday

234
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,300
yesterday's flight

235
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
which went from

236
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
ferrocs

237
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
in

238
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
nearby

239
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Gilford

240
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
to Rotterdam

241
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
from Rotterdam

242
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
to Midasay Lont

243
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
in the Netherlands

244
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
and then that's when we decided

245
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
that we would go back

246
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
back to ferrocs

247
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
I've posted

248
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
my Bluetooth GPS unit

249
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
put it right up on the dashboard of the plane

250
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
I had my I didn't even talk about this

251
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
I had my MDA

252
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
with

253
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
what is that pocket

254
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
FMS

255
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
which is an open source

256
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
flight management system

257
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
which has

258
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
moving map

259
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
flight planning

260
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
it gets all this data

261
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
that's freely available

262
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
off the internet

263
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
which is the same way

264
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
jeperson

265
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
or any of those other guys do it

266
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
all the nav data

267
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
downloads weather data

268
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
for you

269
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
it's a fantastic program

270
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
it's open source

271
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
and it's free

272
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
I don't know

273
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
anything like

274
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
25 euros or something

275
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
to this project

276
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
and it's just it's really

277
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,300
really cool

278
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
you can run it on your laptop

279
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
you can run it on your on your

280
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
on your PDA

281
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
you can select maps

282
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
for the entire world

283
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
anyway

284
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
so I'm also able to

285
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,300
in this bluetooth

286
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
GPS unit

287
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
I'm able to record

288
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
my track

289
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
you know

290
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
the flight that I made

291
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
and if you load that into Google Earth

292
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
you can fly

293
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
the same flight path

294
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
that I flew

295
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
because you can you fly past

296
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
it's just me fast

297
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
the

298
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
has a big inhale

299
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
for instance

300
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,300
which is an airport

301
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
very well known airport

302
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
great navigation point

303
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
and you can actually stop the map

304
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
and then drill down

305
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
and go look at the airfield

306
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
you know you can see

307
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
we crossed over the English channel

308
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
so the next steps there

309
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
and I'm just trying to start

310
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
provide data

311
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
so people can do stuff with it

312
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
I would need easy way

313
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
to add photos to that

314
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
so what I'd like to do

315
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,300
is

316
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
just have some kind of application

317
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
where you throw a bunch of photos in

318
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
that wouldn't necessarily have GPS data

319
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
but would have time data

320
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,300
because GPS data in a GPS file

321
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
has the time as well

322
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
and it gets that time from the satellite

323
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
so you can sync that time up

324
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,300
with your camera I guess

325
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
and then it should know

326
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
where to just drop these spots in

327
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
so you can have hot spots

328
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,300
and pop up pictures

329
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
and

330
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
there's got to be something there

331
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
and then once you've got that piece

332
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
figured out

333
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
then I think we could actually move

334
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
over towards

335
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
combining that with the audio

336
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
from a podcast

337
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
and imagine how cool that would be

338
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
if you recorded the entire trip

339
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
and at any point you wanted to drill down

340
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
you could listen to the audio

341
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
as we were flying

342
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
or as we were just completing that piece

343
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
of the trip

344
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
it sounds like something that could be

345
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
one application all built together

346
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
and actually the MDA would be perfect for it

347
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
because it could take pictures

348
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
it can register GPS data

349
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
and it can record sound

350
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
wouldn't that be cool

351
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
to just be walking around

352
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
and then you

353
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
even if you don't talk

354
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
it doesn't matter

355
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
because only at points of interest

356
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
when you face it you take a picture

357
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
you'll be talking about it

358
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
and then you could just

359
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
you know bring that audio up

360
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
or something

361
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
there is a lot of cool stuff

362
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
that can be done

363
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
and I'm really getting into this GPS stuff

364
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,300
digging it totally

365
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Who's your daddy?

366
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
Who's your daddy?

367
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Who's your daddy?

368
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Who's your daddy?

369
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
Hey Adam, this is Aaron

370
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,300
and this is Cliff

371
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,300
and we're here to introduce

372
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
to you

373
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
the who's your daddy podcast

374
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,300
for two fathers

375
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
to discuss issues

376
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
facing fathers and family

377
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
we're tossing

378
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
a little pod safe music

379
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
some toy abuse

380
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
some tech and humor

381
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
yep

382
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
you'll hear two educated fathers

383
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
talk about things like

384
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
foreskin

385
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
we're going to read this

386
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
a little bit

387
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
a little bit

388
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
a little bit like this

389
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,300
is to a little family

390
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
everyone is a medical thing

391
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
everyone has it except for women

392
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,300
what?

393
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
whoa

394
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
whoa

395
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
that I think is actually incorrect

396
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
not everyone has it

397
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
anymore

398
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,300
and

399
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
you have it so put the

400
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
and don't forget

401
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Cliff's fatherly wisdom

402
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,020
raise your hand if you're

403
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,300
sorry

404
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
two married old sayers

405
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
and uh

406
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
the way to five years

407
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,300
before we had a kid

408
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,300
we realize we want to kid

409
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,300
I had jogging, two dogs, I had chunked him.

410
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,900
I think here your question is a horse or oh, I don't know if I thought maybe a kid

411
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,500
he said no horse, yes kid.

412
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,300
I think horse is actually a costume or the kids.

413
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
They'd maintain.

414
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
He'd be a thing sometimes.

415
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
You don't have to send a horse to college.

416
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
I got to subscribe to this show.

417
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Let's talk.

418
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,300
But I right there was a sound clip that we're really gonna have to hear this again.

419
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
You don't have to send a horse to college.

420
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
So join us every week on the Who's your daddy podcast.

421
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
Thanks Adam.

422
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Can you say goodbye to everybody?

423
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,300
Goodbye.

424
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Pod Joe.

425
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

426
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Hello.

427
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
This is Jack.

428
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,300
I just wanted to let you know that we have changed that year again.

429
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
You know, don't leave every door.

430
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Jew cities.com.

431
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Jack will spend that stray A.K.A.L.S.T.N.

432
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
A lot of people get mixed over and over.

433
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Thank you.

434
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Goodbye.

435
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Yeah, you know, actually I'm listening to the sound.

436
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,300
I think I changed something that I shouldn't have.

437
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Hold on.

438
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Let me just see if I can turn off this limiter here.

439
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,300
See what that does.

440
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Hold on.

441
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
I turned this off.

442
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,300
One two.

443
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
That's actually.

444
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,300
A little.

445
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Oh, it's a little worse.

446
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Hold on.

447
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Let me bring that back in.

448
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
This is interesting.

449
00:14:51,300 --> 00:15:00,660
let's see, bright. There you go. Yeah, that's much better. Okay. Just messing around with the digital

450
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,300
workstation. I really love this box because I can basically use it in any situation that I might

451
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:13,300
run into. You know, need to plug in 3a 4 5 6 extra mics, need to plug in external gear, need

452
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,980
to record stuff, directly to the hard drive. The right now I have it set up in what they call

453
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:26,180
direct mode. So, it's outputting everything in any, you know, it's using the, what you call,

454
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,580
the stereo valve processor is in the chain there. It's just so incredibly cool. What I need is

455
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,380
it, I really need a flight case for all this stuff. I think I should have, because I know that

456
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,500
this is going to be a fucked up if I put this in my suitcase. I should have a flight case for the

457
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,100
mixer, for my microphone, what else should be in it? Well, of course, the mixer has an external power

458
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:55,940
supply they always do. Headphones, maybe even my fire wire drive in there with all the tunes

459
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,340
on it, you know, something like that. It'll just be an additional piece of luggage, but I think

460
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:06,180
it'll be well worth it to carry that around that way. It's not that heavy, but man, this thing

461
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,140
is really, I think it's perfect for getting the job done, if you know what I mean. Okay,

462
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:18,500
promo is going to talk about that for a second. As we start to build up the pod show network

463
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:26,500
and the pod show delivery network, in order to get your podcast out to the masses, the best way

464
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,860
for people to discover new podcast and to browse them is by listening to promos. Now,

465
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,780
there are lots of people making promos, but I'm just amazed at how many people say,

466
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,300
hey, you know, I've got a podcast, could you please mention it, which I'm happy to do, but, you know,

467
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,700
I don't have all the discretionary time either to listen to a whole bunch of podcast. Now, if you

468
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,580
can make a promo, which is exactly what it sounds like, you know, just tell us what the show is about,

469
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,060
you know, what's on it this week, you can make new promos whenever you want. If we, if we can

470
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:03,460
really all get into making promos, then these things can be pushed through so many different avenues,

471
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,900
you know, we can get them on the serious show for you in the pod find or an Apple's iTunes,

472
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:14,980
daily source code. I love playing promos, as you well know. And also, when you create promos,

473
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,140
make sure that you take the same amount of time you might put into creating the ID3 tags

474
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,500
in the metadata for your podcast. Make sure you do that with your promos. I was talking

475
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,620
to Peter about that yesterday. I can't count the number of times that someone sends in a promo that

476
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,460
says, you know, promo.mp3. And, you know, it really, it doesn't help because we're trying to build

477
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,300
databases of all this stuff to make it flow. So we really got to work on our metadata and work on

478
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,900
creating promos in general. Really, it's, it's well worth it. And it can just be spoken word,

479
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,820
you know, it doesn't have to, doesn't have to be an elaborately produced thing. They also shouldn't

480
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:59,220
be too long. You know, I think a good promo is anywhere from, you know, 30 seconds,

481
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,140
the two minutes, you know, kind of in that range. It all depends. You know, sometimes there,

482
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,900
one promo is more entertaining than the other. But it is going to be something really important

483
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:15,780
and really key if you want to promote your podcast. So we're also going in the, in the directory.

484
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,580
And of course, you know, we're about to reach out to all the node managers. We've got new tools

485
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:26,980
on the way. A personalized page for each node manager so that you can, you know, actually write

486
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,700
about, you know, the category that you're interested in, that you are maintaining. And also a way

487
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,220
to attach promos and to have promos flow through, well, we shouldn't make that automatic.

488
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:45,300
There should be, maybe we need a God wouldn't that be cool if we had a tag in the RSS feed,

489
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,620
which could be for a recent promo. We could create a promo namespace, I guess, to go along with

490
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,100
the RSS feed so that that could automatically be picked up. Oh, this is actually a pretty good idea.

491
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Let's think about that for a second. Hey, babe. Yeah. I'm sorry. What's the number for the

492
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:18,180
taxi? Oh, because you don't have your phone. Oh, hold on a second. Excuse me. You're what?

493
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:24,020
Come over here. We can't hear you. You're hungry. Why are you hungry, girl? Why haven't

494
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,820
you eaten? I've eaten a yogurt because no one said me. You're talking to the mic and I'll write down the number.

495
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,780
Well, I need to say the mic. I don't know. You're on the daily source code.

496
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,380
Well, good morning. It's a lovely sunny day in England once again.

497
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:45,220
No, it's not. I know it was being wrapped. I was being sarcastic. That's why every morning

498
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,700
everyone. Oh, how are you? It's lovely sunny day. But yeah, it's raining. That was a really easy number.

499
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:58,260
Five six six five six six. I don't even remember that. That's an easy number, isn't it? Well, I'm off.

500
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:05,780
Okay, what time are you back? Um six. Okay. What? I love you. Do you look bad?

501
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,180
Come over here and say that again. Do I look bad? Well, why don't you say do I look good? Is that more

502
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:19,540
positive? No. Is that okay? You look wonderful right here. Now, what are you going? I'm going to the

503
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:25,620
bar to pick up my phone and then I'm going to the bar. Yes, I'm going to the bar to get dreaded.

504
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:33,940
Enjoy. Did you close my door? Thank you. Love you. Have fun.

505
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,220
Okay, she's not really going to the bar. She had some friends over last night and one of the,

506
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,700
one of her friends, I guess you watch as dishes in like a bar pub and they both have the same cell

507
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,980
phone and he accidentally took hers. But I did promise myself we're going to talk about teenagers

508
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:03,780
sometimes, man. You know, just what the way they talk back to you and I remember right and it's like

509
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,300
double, double edged sword. I'm just my mic because I remember so well my parents, you know,

510
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,780
saying don't talk back to us like that. And now I'm here and you know, I'm hearing my parents voice

511
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,260
come out of my freaking head. You know, it's like I don't want to be in this infinite loop. So I'm

512
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,900
like trying to change that. So my daughter won't have the same influences on her kids.

513
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,980
But man, sometimes you just want to stick those teenagers right up on the wall behind the wall paper,

514
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,860
man. Gosh, they can really get, and you know, this, like take that for it. You know, how many times a day,

515
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:41,300
my daughter says, does my hair okay? Is my face okay? You know, do you see any acne? Do I look okay?

516
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,100
Sometimes I just say, no, he looks like shit, you know, just a mess with her. And they just

517
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:53,860
know I don't. And it's like, oh, man. Anyway, a young woman coming into her own. And you're witnessing

518
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,220
it here daily on the source code. I didn't, I don't know if you knew what it would have gone on with

519
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:07,620
British airways. They had a strike, their caterer, a gate gourmet, went on strike for a couple of

520
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:15,140
some firings that I guess the union felt were unfair or someone fired a union member. I think the

521
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,300
story, because they were trying to organize some type of strike or some kind of action.

522
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,740
And so then the whole company just went on strike, which really messed up Heathrow Airport.

523
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,980
This was about, it was the beginning of our vacation. So it was like two weeks ago. And in that

524
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:39,060
two week period, British airways has not been able to feed their passengers no matter what

525
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:45,460
class you're in, it's just like there's no food, there's no drink other than water. And of course,

526
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:51,940
I've traveled with British airways. And I just received in the email a nice note from that I want

527
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,180
to share with you. Dear Mr. Curry, as you are a valued customer to British airways, I'd like

528
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,500
to provide you with an update on the current problems we are experiencing with our onboard catering

529
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:06,500
due to the unofficial industrial action by our Heathrow catering supplier gate gourmet. Although

530
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,500
British airways services into an out of London Heathrow continue to operate as normal,

531
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,620
we have limited onboard catering. There will be some catering provided at the airport prior

532
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,300
to the departure, however we are continuing to advise passengers, especially those with special

533
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:26,580
dietary requirements to eat before arriving at the airport. We do apologize in advance for any

534
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,340
inconvenience, blah, blah, blah, blah, like wow, you know, for British airways who really

535
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,980
He pride themselves on their service.

536
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,220
This is bad news.

537
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,460
Although, I must say, this unauthorized industrial action

538
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,180
did work.

539
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,420
I mean, this is something that really affects an airline.

540
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,220
I think it's extremely effective thing to do.

541
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,900
I would not fly British airways.

542
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,380
And there's a long haul flights.

543
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,660
Australia, imagine going to Australia, no food, no drink.

544
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,460
And you can't even get coffee or tea.

545
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,020
All it is is just water that's on board.

546
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,860
So, you know.

547
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,820
Thank goodness for Sir Richard and his Virgin Airlines.

548
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,340
And it looks like I won't be flying back to San Francisco

549
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,740
until September, which is good because I didn't,

550
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,300
I wanted to be home for Christina's birthday.

551
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Be nice to be home for my birthday, which is coming up September 3rd.

552
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,820
So, I think that 12th of September, I'm going to go to New York.

553
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,860
We're going to do a couple days in New York.

554
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,020
Then I'll be out in San Francisco for about 10 days and looking forward to it.

555
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,380
Because stuff has hoppin' at the office.

556
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,380
C.C. Chapman was there.

557
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,060
I think he's still there and Chris Rockwell.

558
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:38,140
And, you know, I think everyone's just eventually going to come out and hang out

559
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,900
and we're getting stuff done.

560
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,940
Be on the lookout for it very, very soon.

561
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,740
Do you like great music?

562
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,980
Yeah, that's me.

563
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,620
I'm Chris from Rain Bucket.

564
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,180
My mother's so proud.

565
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,420
If you like great tunes, check out the Hoonik Podcast.

566
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,540
He's at hoonik.info.

567
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,020
That's H-O-O-O.

568
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,220
H-O-O.

569
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,180
And I C-K.info.

570
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,220
I-N-F-O.

571
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,020
You're going to love it.

572
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,260
Hi Adam.

573
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,540
It's Mark here.

574
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,740
I was on vacation recently and I've been listening to me all the shows back

575
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:38,700
in 2009, 2009, so I think it was 2-0-1 or 2-0-2, one of those two.

576
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,060
You're on about contacting you with anyone who's interested in getting into Podge.

577
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:53,220
And I have just begun to get into Podge, I think, of got a 50 megabyte limited web space

578
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,900
but no bandwidth, except for no, I can't do all of this feed on what I can, but I just

579
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
don't know how.

580
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,700
It's not well enough, it's very indexed, except for it.

581
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,780
So I'll leave my email address and Skype them at the end.

582
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
I hope you can help.

583
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
Thank you very much.

584
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
Bye-bye.

585
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Email.

586
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
M-D-W-T.

587
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
Alright, Mark.

588
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
You know what?

589
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:22,260
I got good news for you because, essentially, very soon, we'll be hooking up through Podge

590
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,940
with all of that.

591
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,220
And as I said before, I really wanted to be incredibly simple.

592
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,900
You should be able to fire up cast blaster, put your show notes in, and just hit, you know,

593
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,500
publish this podcast, and it should all go.

594
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,220
Your show blogs should be arranged, your file uploads automatically, everything is all set

595
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,220
and you shouldn't.

596
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,060
I think you shouldn't have to pay for that actually, and that's what we're going to work

597
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,060
on.

598
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:52,620
Just going through the mail bag, guess it was, on one of my, was that one of my, no, it was

599
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,700
even before one of my drives in from Berkeley.

600
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:01,340
I was talking about the podcast awards, and I was wondering if there was a ceremony that

601
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,940
went along with that, and there is indeed a ceremony, which will be at the podcast expo,

602
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,500
be sure to put a link into the show notes to that.

603
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,220
That was the coming up really soon.

604
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,740
I thought that that isn't September, I think, or maybe it's later than that.

605
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,260
So again, I think it's, I still like the, like the surprise effect of not knowing who the

606
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,980
winners are before the ceremony, but at least there's going to be a ceremony.

607
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,860
It's that's pretty cool.

608
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,180
You know, while those promos were playing something really weird happened, all of a sudden,

609
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:36,220
my entire screen went black, and it had big white letters, and it said crime scene evidence,

610
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,500
and then that thing popped out.

611
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,100
I had no idea where that came from.

612
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,900
I don't know if it came from Megaseg or I have Omni Outliner open, but I was, I was like,

613
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,860
the weirdest thing.

614
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,660
After I record the show, I go back and see if that was something that was associated in one of

615
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,380
the promos.

616
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,220
That was a very, very frightening.

617
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,620
Other stuff from the mail bag, let's see.

618
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:04,060
Oh, remember I was at the Clairemont spawn resort, and I met a guy in the, in the health club,

619
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,660
as I was going to go for my floatation.

620
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,820
His name is Chad Dickerson, and he actually wrote about our brief encounter, and he put a pretty

621
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,500
interesting blog post up, so I'll post a link to that in the show notes as well.

622
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,020
What was that?

623
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Oh, that's Christina's taxi.

624
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,940
It's working, you know, I like this feedback loop where you can bump into someone,

625
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,420
and then you say something on the show, and then he writes something on a blog post,

626
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,100
and then I mentioned it back in the show.

627
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,660
This is like the way radio is supposed to be.

628
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:42,300
Devon also, and this is referring to, this is definitely referring to our California trip.

629
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,100
Said I definitely write.

630
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,180
So I'm presently enjoying your family's vacation, diary, daily source code two, two, two,

631
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,020
but fill compelled to offer a slight correction.

632
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,380
MC Hammer's not from Oakland, but from Tracy, which is considerably inland from the East Bay.

633
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:03,580
It might be from Tracy, but didn't you have that huge house in Oakland, you know, the one with

634
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,300
like the waterfalls and 8,000 people on staff?

635
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,540
Something like that, I thought that was Oakland, and what's MC Hammer doing?

636
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:17,020
You know, the guy's got talent, you know, I know he went bust, but should have looked him up.

637
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Anyone know what MC Hammer is doing?

638
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,260
I'm sure we could do some fun stuff in podcasting with him.

639
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:29,980
And also from the mailbag, this was a nice message that was sent in for the one-year anniversary

640
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,500
of the daily source code. I didn't get a chance to play it on the show, so I figured I

641
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,220
do it now because it's from two of my podcasting and life buddies, Ken and Squid.

642
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:45,660
Hey Adam, it's Cindy from the Ken and Squid show. Here's a special message from us to you in honor

643
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,780
of the one-year anniversary of the daily source code. Hit it, Kenny.

644
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,900
That's right. Right here on the Ken and Squid show.

645
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:07,180
Squid is going to take it all off, bro, and to grow some pasties.

646
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,820
That made me kind of hungry.

647
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
Somebody got me some pie.

648
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,980
And she's off. Oh yes, there she goes, ladies and gentlemen.

649
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,180
And say, this girl's friend given all your gots and asked the ticket, you're really not going off.

650
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,140
Uh-huh.

651
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,140
Look at those babies go.

652
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,420
Boy, I don't know. That puts the S in, squipper.

653
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,940
Excuse me, ma'am. Please step away from the window and put your clothes back on.

654
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,220
Oh, oh officer. I didn't hear you coming home. For the love of God's whip.

655
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:05,900
I just, I was just, uh, um, just thought it'd be good. Honestly, ma'am, I don't know whether they're

656
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,860
the issue of citation earth. Ask for your phone number.

657
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:16,860
I'm the anniversary, um, congratulations on all your successes during the past year and best

658
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:22,540
of luck for the future. Special Kenan's whip show love bubbles are headed your ways, sir.

659
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,820
And I'll be in touch as long as they have email from jail. This is a terrible predicament. We find ourselves

660
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,580
in on this auspicious occasion. But it was a nifty dance, Kenny wasn't it? Oh, it sure was.

661
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,460
Well worth it. That's what I say. Happy anniversary. Have an excited day.

662
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:47,180
Awesome. Okay. And they look great, squip. Thank you.

663
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,660
Yeah. We got to get, uh, that's another thing I got to put on the list. We got to get Skype

664
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,300
recording into cast blaster because I know how those guys are recording. Ken basically sits with

665
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:04,060
the, the other great microphone, but he positions the speakers that he's running Skype on around the

666
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:12,300
mic so that he's basically, uh, talking to Cindy through his microphone and then what he's

667
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,460
getting back from her is fed through the speakers into the microphone. So she sounds a little bit

668
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,020
muffled. Um, I was cruising around the pod safe music network the this morning looking for some

669
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,260
stuff. And you know what I like about this is what, you know, when you hear like when someone says

670
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,260
independent artists, I usually think about like independent rock, alternative rock, you know,

671
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,700
emo stuff. Um, but if you just go through all the genres and you, and you browse by

672
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:43,500
the genre, you can get some really incredible tunes. This one, uh, I kind of liked it.

673
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,060
Jennifer Halane, swallow me odd safe on the source code.

674
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,820
I won't let anyone put a chain in.

675
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:27,180
Swallow me swallow me. Make sure you chew it all out, because why go down can come back up, and I can't

676
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,940
forever and forever and well.

677
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:50,780
Don't play dumb, you don't fall in anyone, advice me until I was numb. Now the ice is melted down,

678
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:56,220
it's just in my day with heart. I'll always learn it, I turn off the flame,

679
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,220
you can't be drunk, I don't crush it with you.

680
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:19,900
Swallow me swallow me. Make sure you chew it all out, because why go down can come back up.

681
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:26,780
Now I can't forever and well.

682
00:34:51,100 --> 00:35:00,780
Swallow me swallow me. Make sure you chew it all out, because why go down can come back up.

683
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,180
Now I can't forever and well.

684
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:15,180
Your prison is a sin, because while I'm shy, I will not die, so put them away, so we're getting out of the fly.

685
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:34,860
Swallow me swallow me. Make sure you chew it all out, because why go down can come back up.

686
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:41,180
And I can't forever and well.

687
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Swallow me swallow me. Make sure you chew it all out, because why go down can come back up.

688
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Swallow me swallow me. Make sure you chew it all out, because why go down can come back up.

689
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,180
You chew it all out, because why go down can come back up.

690
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,180
Jennifer Helaine swallow me. Pot safe on your daily source code, link to her website in the show notes for today's daily source code.

691
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,180
And that's it for the 24th of August, 2005. Hope you enjoy.

692
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Keep those promos comments submit at podshow.com. Keep sending them in. Really need them.

693
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,180
We've got to expose more listeners to more cool stuff.

694
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,180
If you got pod safe music, head over to the pod safe music network and

695
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:37,180
odd safe music network.com or music.potshow.com.

696
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,180
And of course, you can always send me audio feedback out of my curie.com.

697
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,180
I'm a 98% now on the Gmail, so please don't attach MP3. Send me a link.

698
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,180
If throw it up on a server somewhere, and also when it comes to feedback,

699
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,180
I wouldn't mind if you put some metadata in there as well.

700
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:57,180
Use the ID3 tied. Don't just send me a file that says feedback for Adam.

701
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,180
It just makes life so much more complicated, and it shouldn't take much

702
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,180
a lot of extra effort to do that.

703
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:09,180
Thedysource.com is where you can find the podcast feed for the show. Hope you do subscribe.

And of course, there's www.curry.com.

705
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:19,180
That's the weblog, which is running a hell of a lot better these days.

706
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:26,620
Marcus has been rewriting responders because we've gotten so much comments

707
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,180
fab. And when you post a comment, it does take a resources on the machine.

708
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:38,180
If you're posting one every second, you're going to bring a machine to its knees eventually.

709
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,180
And it's all poker spanned.

710
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,180
Licker poker.

711
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,180
The penis enlargement. You know, all the basic good stuff.

712
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,180
Alright, that's it. I'll be back tomorrow with the Thursday edition

713
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,180
