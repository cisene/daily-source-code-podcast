00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,200
the windy city, from the affluent suburbs of London, England, to the squalid steamy slums

00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
of sunny Florida.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,800
They came with a burning hunger, a permanent desire, and a single-minded obsession with

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,480
taking back the media.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,760

Now, playing on serious satellite 103 and finding B3 players everywhere.

There are no secrets.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm sorry, information you don't get higher.

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Adam Curry.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,120
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

We don't need no sticking friends in it.

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Fantastic.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
It's a battle curry.

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
And it is Thursday.

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
October 20, 2005.

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,120
The power of the door.

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Why everybody?

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
How you doing?

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Welcome once again to the show.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
I brought to you from the Curry condo.

56

Another foggy day in San Francisco town.

57

It is about 5 minutes past 10 Thursday morning.

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
The 20th of October.

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
This is your daily source code.

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,120
A little bit later than normal today because, well, I got cable now.

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
So you know what I did last night when I got home?

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Yeah, exactly.

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Is it a veg out?

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
My goodness.

65
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Television is so destructive.

66
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
It's stolen entire evening.

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,120
I don't even remember what I watched.

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
But it's here.

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Not one but two televisions.

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
One of the bedroom.

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
One in the main living room area.

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Nice little LCD flat screens.

73
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
I'll cheap those but they certainly do the job.

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
You know what?

75
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Comcast is amazing.

76
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
It's like a thousand channels on a thing.

77
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,120
I think I'm witnessing my jet lag.

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
It's starting to finally catch up with me.

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Yeah.

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
See, when I come in, I came in Sunday, right?

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Yeah, Sunday.

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,120
And then switch my clock immediately and got going on Monday.

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,120
So this is what usually happens.

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,120
I went to bed around one o'clock, 115.

85
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
That's when I switched the TV off.

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Of course, my brain was nice and rested, not.

87
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
And I was up at like seven o'clock before the alarm clock.

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
But I had my alarm set for eight.

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,120
So I lounge around and rednate on a blackberry.

90
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Yes, probably in food tours as well.

91
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Okay.

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Today, some different pot-save music, some different genres.

93
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,120
I've been hunting around trying to get a different kind of fix.

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Instead of what we've normally played on the source code.

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,120
And good old art, a dub for mashuptown.com, sent me a wonderful mashup.

96
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,120
It's kind of a remix mashup, but it's just, it's like so honky honky.

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,120
It's an album, John, but as you've never heard of before,

98
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Adam's honky cat remix brought to you by mashuptown.com.

99
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Enjoy everybody.

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Good night.

417
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Good night.

418
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Good night.

419
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Good night.

420
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120

441
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Good night.

442
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Good night.

443
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Good night.

444
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Good night.

445
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Good night.

446
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Good night.

447
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Good night.

448
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Good night.

449
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Good night.

450
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120

Good night.

453
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Good night.

454
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Good night.

455
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Good night.

456
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Good night.

457
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Good night.

458
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Good night.

459
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Good night.

460
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Good night.

461
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Good night.

462
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Good night.

463
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Good night.

464
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
Good night.

465
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Good night.

466
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Good night.

467
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Good night.

468
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Good night.

469
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Good night.

470
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Good night.

471
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Good night.

472
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Good night.

473
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Good night.

474
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Good night.

475
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Good night.

476
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Good night.

477
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Good night.

478
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Good night.

479
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Good night.

480
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Good night.

481
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Good night.

482
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Good night.

483
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Good night.

484
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Good night.

485
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Good night.

486
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Good night.

487
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,320
until the weekend, then I'm going to go to the Apple Store,

488
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
I'm going to load up, get me one of the,

489
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,680
do you see that they released a new IMac G5

490
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,080
with a dual processor?

491
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,880
Oh yeah, man, they're just coming one after another.

492
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,680
I hope that, you know, since I'm going to wait

493
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,480
until the weekend to get the IMac,

494
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
I hope that all of a sudden new power books will appear.

495
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,920
It's unbelievable, Apple just cranking the shit out.

496
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,920
So as I said yesterday, he probably heard it at the very end

497
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,640
of the show, the cable guy called up, he was downstairs,

498
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,400
activating my service, came upstairs, installed the Motorola

499
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,680
bitch surfer, whatever.

500
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,960
I think it's called bitch surfer, but bitch surfer, sex, sex.

501
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,920
Sorry, Freudian slip.

502
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,000
Six megabits per second download speed and 500 kilobite per second

503
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,760
upload speed.

504
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,640
It's good enough.

505
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm really digging it.

506
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,280
It's called curry condo and I'm broadcasted from the 24th floor

507
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,360
across across the south of market area of San Francisco.

508
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,040
So if you can read my signal and you can hop on, let me know.

509
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,080
It's open, obviously.

510
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,520
So I bought a, what is that?

511
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,720
Is that a deal link?

512
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,480
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a dork.

513
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,760
I probably didn't even get a linksis.

514
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,280
It's so stupid.

515
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,680
Oh, man, I can't believe that.

516
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,920
Because linksis has that firmware that we talked about.

517
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,480
Oh, man, okay, well, anyway, so curry condo,

518
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,440
you can get in and use that and curious to see how

519
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
far that signal reaches.

520
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,560
Because I've got nothing but glass up here in the condo.

521
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,240
Okay, daily source code for Thursday.

522
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,320
As I said, it's kind of drab and dreary, it's gray, foggy.

523
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,360
The sun is up, but it's having a hard time breaking through and burning

524
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
anything off.

525
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,040
It may burn off, but this is kind of like the weather that we had when I was

526
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
here with the girls.

527
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,680
And I gotta tell you, I really do miss them.

528
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,800
Oh, dude, that's the one thing where the time zone really sucked.

529
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,680
Oh, we've been through that a million times, but I miss them.

530
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,120
And Christina has vacation next week, and I'm not going to be there.

531
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,680
Oh, by the way, so we decided we're not going to Portugal because Patricia

532
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,720
wasn't feeling well, and she needs, she needs it like a week to recuperate,

533
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,000
just to make sure, not by getting another airplane, she's going to get sick again.

534
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,920
And by the way, she sounds like some sickly woman, but she's not.

535
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,280
This is just unbelievable, series of events that have come down.

536
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,000
So she'd really deserves a break.

537
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,840
So the big break, of course, is not getting up early in the morning for

538
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,280
Christina's routine to get her off to school.

539
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:55,920
So that just by itself, and of course, not having me around to keep her up late at night.

540
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,560
Second part of the health update is about the cholesterol reading that I gave you yesterday.

541
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
I'm a dying man.

542
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:11,200
I mean, of course, we're all dying every single day, but let me see, where was, oh, of course,

543
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,920
there was a doctor, oh, man, let me see.

544
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,680
I thought I'd cue that one up from the talk about with you.

545
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,120
Let me say, I got a couple of different emails pointing to different sites about cholesterol.

546
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,520
Here we go, Mark Katz, that's the one I wanted to read to you.

547
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay, this is from Mark R Katz M. D.

548
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,040
Chief of cardiac surgery, director Virginia Transplant Center,

549
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:42,160
Henrico Doctors Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, Adam, your ass is in big trouble.

550
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,600
Stop eating all that crap and get your butt off the couch.

551
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,560
A cholesterol of 200 is too high.

552
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,760
Most current think it should be below 180.

553
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Diet is the first line of attack to lower your cholesterol.

554
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,760
HDL was the good cholesterol, so you wanted high.

555
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,520
Exercise is one of the best means to accomplish this.

556
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,200
There's some more sophisticated tests to further delineate the subgroups of cholesterol and lipids.

557
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,240
That's the HDL LDL and VL DL.

558
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,120
And it's always as bad as RSS and OPML.

559
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,200
Sometimes drugs are indicated to help with these, but diet and exercise are first.

560
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Well, first of all, I'm not a big crap eater.

561
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,160
I really am not.

562
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,520
I'm just not.

563
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,600
I'm not a big crap eater.

564
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,800
I don't exercise enough.

565
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
That's for sure.

566
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,360
And then I find out that basically I have a moderate risk of a heart attack because,

567
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
well, you know, of the main two points.

568
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,440
One is you're over 40.

569
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,800
You get that right off the bat and what's the other one?

570
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,040
You're a guy, I don't know, something weird.

571
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,080
So, uh, so that's really nice.

572
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,760
I'm a little concerned about everything now.

573
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Okay.

574
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,600
So today, track suit, gym, workout, ride the wheels off this motherfucker.

575
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Remember back with alternative rock music really meant something?

576
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,200
If you know what we're talking about, your retro fix is only a click away.

577
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,520
This is your best hot day, you ever had joy.

578
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,600

Hi, this is Daria from boutiquefay.com.

588
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,080
For the third straight year, hundreds of eBay boutique designers joined together for a

589
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,800
cause near and dear to our hearts.

590
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,640
The breast cancer awareness auctions or the BCA's.

591
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,160
We hope.

592
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,000
Please give, we bid, we bid, we bid, we bid.

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,160
October 17th to 21st, search boutique BCA in your eBay search box to find all of the

594
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,760

596
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,200

599
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Thank you.

600
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Thank you, thank you.

601
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:31,480
Do you love movies?

602
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,200
Do you consider film an art form rather than mere popcorn entertainment?

603
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,440
Do you gleefully chuck handfuls of raisinets and morons who leave their cell phones on during

604
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,400
every single screening you attend?

605
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,800
Do you refuse to run away an abject horror at the thought of a subtitle movie?

606
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,840
Then you should check out CinemaSlave, a brand new podcast devoted to the passionate celebration

607
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
of all things filmed.

608
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,360
Reviews are the best and worst in cinema and DVD.

609
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,200
Discussions about filmmaking, Frankenstein and the French New Wave, and best of all violent

610
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,600
arguments about movies from people who love them in a way frowned upon by the Bible.

611
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:22,040
Check out CinemaSlave at www.cinemoslave.com or through the iTunes Music Store.

612
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,080
It's free but not recommended for the faint heartache.

613
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,600
Thanks by the way everyone who sent in a new or great duo or duet names to compare Ron

614
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,600
Bloom and myself too.

615
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,480
Yesterday I said that we were kind of like Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton when we get to

616
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,840
happen with each other.

617
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,320
The best one came from Julia in LA, my buddy, Jules.

618
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,840
She said, no you guys are more like Donnie and Marie because he's a little country and you're

619
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,200
a little rack and roll on gosh darn.

620
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,560
So yesterday, right after the Comcast guy came and installed everything, Ron and I rolled

621
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:06,440
off to San Hill Road, famous place in Silicon Valley where all the big venture capital

622
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,440
firms are to have a meeting with Ray Lane who, of course, is anything but the quintessential

623
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,960
venture capital venture capitalist, he's not, you know, that's probably why I'm

624
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,880
like him so much, he used to be the chief operating officer of Oracle.

625
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,800
So he, you know, he's an operator, he knows how companies run and he has a lot of experience,

626
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,920
he's up there for in my mind, he's up there with a lot of the really big guys who run

627
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
the really, really big companies.

628
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,280
But he's a guy's guy, you know, went to WVU, and of course I went to West Virginia, not

629
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,760
for long, but I went to West Virginia for some college, so there's some connection there,

630
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,520
but this weekend he's off hunting with his buddies, they're going fescent hunting in South

631
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Dakota.

632
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,120
Oh man, he has some interesting stories.

633
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,000
So we were talking yesterday, just, you know, as I said, whenever I'm out here, we always

634
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,240
want to go and, well, actually, we've tried to hate our investors, at least once a week,

635
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,440
just to keep up to date, we always have some questions they had to go and have some input

636
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,360
on or open the rollo decks on, which, of course, is very, very cool.

637
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,640
And it was a little earlier that he had asked Ron, said, do you know the names of all

638
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,360
your employees in the office now, and, of course, I think both of us do?

639
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,320
And he says, well, good because the diet is cast, you know, from now on, you know, you've

640
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,360
set the mold of the company, and everyone else who comes after that is going to be reflection

641
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
of that first team.

642
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,520
And I thought I was a kind of really interesting exercise to go through the names of the

643
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,920
people that we have in the office.

644
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Now there's a ton more people outside, you know, members of the pod squad, of course,

645
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,480
so we have P-D-O, P-W-Fenton in Florida.

646
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,240
We've got, well, as I said, I just outside of the pod squadters, we have, let me just go

647
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
through the office for a second.

648
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,440
Let me see if I can name them, tell you a little bit about each person.

649
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,780
And I'm doing it visually, right, because I'm just closing my eyes and seeing all the

650
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,780
heads where they sit.

651
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,000
So we have Sue, I'm going to start with Sue.

652
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,400
Sue has been working with us along with CC Chapman and Chris Bershier, so we'll

653
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,160
get to in a second.

654
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,320
On the Podsake Music Network, so we've actually known Sue for a number of months, and she

655
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,280
kind of worked freelance on that, and then we hired her because, you know, she did a kick-ass

656
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,920
job managing the project, and with the design and with the user interface, I'm not going

657
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,600
to go into too much depth about everyone because I could talk for hours.

658
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,120
Next to her, we have Colleen Colleen's, I mean, with us for like a month, I think, she

659
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,120
comes from tag.com, she's a social network specialist, then we have Marcus Moller, well,

660
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
we all know Marcus.

661
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,480
Marcus has been attached to my hip, you know, even though there's been thousands of

662
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,800
miles of distance between us, but ever since we started school blogs.com, so that's

663
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
been a couple of years.

664
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,640
Our favorite poopcaster, Chris Rockwell, of course, you know, I bumped into, well, he

665
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,920
interviewed me on the Daily Download, where he was doing his poopcast, and I reciprocated.

666
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,960
It's still a fantastic show to listen to, I love it, and he started out doing a lot of

667
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,560
the database programming for the Podsake Music Network, and he's moved out here, and

668
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,160
Lori is coming, I don't know if Lori's out here yet, but she's coming, that just picked

669
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
up and moved.

670
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,560
Let me see, go around, then we have, the prints of the Podcast alley, Chris Mac and

671
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,360
Tyre, we got a lot of Chris's, by the way, all with different spellings, of course, then

672
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:36,360
we have Kevin, Kevin, we call him the Rockstar, he's a code slinger, and he worked with,

673
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,440
how's the name of that company that does websites for music stars, so he did like the

674
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,480
kiss website or Gene Simmons website and how to deal with him, so you can deal with Gene

675
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,920
Simmons, you can deal with anybody, then we have Aaron Brousel, Aaron, as marketing and

676
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,120
PR, better known as the Pod Pimp, then I'll kind of go to the left there, we have Chris

677
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,640
Jacob, let me go back to Aaron for a second, Eric and Chris know each other from the Web

678
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:11,040
TV days, and Aaron drives a Prius, okay, then we have Chris and Chris is all over the

679
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,200
place, man, he's in New York, he's in LA, he's, as I said, business development, he's

680
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,640
doing a great job, and I've known Chris a long time as well, from the on-ramp days, man,

681
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,880
I was like 14 years ago, 12 years ago, when the first metaverse dot com server was in

682
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,040
his apartment here in San Francisco, then we have Brian longest, director of operations,

683
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,200
we talked about Brian a lot, he was, with Ron and I as we started up Pod Show, then we

684
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,920
knew guy Phil, I don't know Phil's last name off hand, but he's a freelancer, he's

685
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:49,040
like a, he's like a gun slinger, he comes in, does PHP and leaves, and he'll be in for I

686
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,520
guess a couple of weeks, then we have Matt, Matt is, he has an interesting job, he's in, I call

687
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,720
it traffic, but that's not, that's not right, but he does all the statistics, all the

688
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:09,400
add-insertions, understanding the audience, I think he's still developing his job, there's

689
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:17,400
so much to be done there, we've got Rosie up front who just really runs the office, if

690
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:27,400
you will, let me think, did I get everybody, I thought I did pretty good on that, yeah, I think

691
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:38,360
you know what, if I forgot someone, I'll buy you dinner, hello Adam, hello Adam, hello Adam,

692
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,640
do you know who this is, this is PW Frenton, I'm Mike, this is Alex, I do, and that's Adam's,

693
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,480
hello, the announcer guy Kevin here, it's Dave Fox, and I'm here with you on today to bring you

694
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,800
today's hit test, the hit test, the hit test, the hit test with young bullet, hey Adam,

695
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:01,640
you can hear I've been having some fun with some editing software and a computer, and I've put

696
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,120
together bits and pieces from all the things I've collected in the last 66 hit tests, and now it's

697
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:18,360
time for hit test number 67, so are you ready, this is number one, I got to be careful not to

698
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,400
blur it out the answers too soon because I want to give everyone a chance, that's got to be

699
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:31,480
night fever, BG's, and this is number two, this is why she was still a pudgy little teenager,

700
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,920
I met her in this period, when I think of you Joanna Jackson, this is easy young, and the final one is

701
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:50,760
three as always, he's the greatest dancer, sister sledge, I think, I'm afraid I made it a bit too easy

702
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:58,520
today, no shit, this is answer number one in today's hit test, it's a song from 1978, it's the BG's,

703
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
this is night fever,

704
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:36,600
answer number one, the BG's, and this is answer number two, it's a song from 19, what is it?

705
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:44,600
86, and it's a genogection, and the song is called, when I think of you,

706
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:25,080
I really made it to easy, I think, at least for you Adam, but boy, what did they make good music,

707
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:32,840
way back like this one from 1979, sister sledge, who's the greatest dancer,

708
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:39,000
essential number three in today's hit test, one night, and disco on the outskirts of

709
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:48,280
fiscal, I was cruising with my favorite game, the place was so boring, without a time as touring,

710
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:58,840
I knew that it wasn't my thing, I loved the one, he's the greatest dancer, I loved the one,

711
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:15,800
he's the greatest dancer, and that's it, answer number three, sister sledge, he's the greatest dancer,

712
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:23,640
and that concludes hit test number 67, okay, thank you for playing this one Adam, I hope you enjoyed this

713
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,960
one, and you had all three of them, if not, I am very disappointed in you, just kidding,

714
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
okay, well thanks again, see you next time, oh and don't forget to check out the iTunes links

715
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,600
on the website if you're gonna buy some of the tricks, that's you've heard on the hit test,

716
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,640
I leave it to Dave to give you all the other and the other info, so until next time, bye-bye,

717
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:57,080
okay, I have really and pissed off now, you hear mega-sag, it's gotten out, this has, this is my

718
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,560
Mac, man, let me just see playback, is any options that I messed up here, auto-sag trim, oh well,

719
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,440
how about if we just bring that back, you know, maybe that's the problem, maybe it's cutting out after

720
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,200
seven seconds or something like that, god damn, but so that's the ending problem, but the other

721
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,240
problem is, I think the Mac need to reboot, I'm still running off the fire wire drive, okay,

722
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:26,840
saving library one moment please, I forgot to tell you one thing about Ray Lane, so we were almost

723
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:33,800
almost got, he has a, we talk aviation a lot too, he has a G4 golf stream, jet, and he has a

724
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:41,480
challenger, he has a jet for each foot, and I say, hey, you know, I sold half of the challenger,

725
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,560
the other half is for sale, you know, I second buy half a challenger, oh that's one, yeah, five million

726
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:53,080
dollars, oh my goodness, no dude, I'm not gonna buy any plane that I can't fly myself, I'm still in the

727
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,280
Charlie 182 Romeo golf mode if you don't mind, it's be kind of flying, I guess I told you about the

728
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,680
flight back from from Redmond City at all, where the pilot came on and told me that if you

729
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,040
looked out the left-hand side of the aircraft, you could see Mars underneath the moon,

730
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,360
well of course, one of the source code listeners, can you just believe the kind of people who

731
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,160
listen to this show, how cool is that? We've got a major cardiologist telling me I'm going to die,

732
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,560
and now we have a space cadet. I had him, this is Russell Hanson, I was listening to Davy's

733
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,840
source code 262, the other morning, and I heard you say this. And say, you know, if you look

734
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,600
out the left-hand side of the aircraft, you'll see, you'll see the moon, okay, duh, saw that,

735
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,120
but underneath that it's a planet, he said that's planet Mars and apparently this is the closest

736
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:43,480
Mars got to or has been to the moon, and I subsequently, I guess, the Earth in 60 years.

737
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,720
So I thought it'd give you some details of what you actually have in here.

738
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:54,040
I'm on October 29th, around 11.25 pm, meast in daylight time. Mars and Earth will be the

739
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,760
closest that they've been since August 2003. Now, the August 2003 event was closer than it is this year,

740
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,320
and the August 2003 event was also the closest that Mars had been to Earth in nearly 60,

741
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,920
thousands years, but this year's events still pretty good. And it's the closest that Mars

742
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,960
will be to Earth again until summer of 2019, so we don't get these changes very often.

743
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,600
As Mars gets closer to Earth, it gets brighter. And by the time it said it's closest point,

744
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,840
it'll be not quite as bright as Venus, but it will surpass serious, which is the brightest

745
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,000
star in the sky. So I'm going to give those Halloween kids something to look at while they're

746
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,040
picking up all their treats. Now, the other thing you mentioned was that it's the closest to the

747
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,760
moon that's been. Now, I don't think that's really correct when we're actually talking about

748
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:49,480
closest distance wise. When you see it in the night sky, how visually close it is to the moon,

749
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,480
as what you're talking about there, I think, which hasn't got anything really to do with

750
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,440
where Mars is in space itself. Just makes it good to look at, which, of course, has

751
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,640
astronomy being such a visual hobby science that it is. It makes it great for those of us

752
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,680
looking here from down below. So I hope that gives you a few more details. I hope that gives you

753
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,720
the answers you're after. You can look forward to more of this kind of information soon,

754
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:21,320
when I release my astronomy podcast on astronomy.podcast format.com, I'll be covering news

755
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,920
and events and all sorts of astronomy on the internet information in a couple of different

756
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,520
podcast formats. So I hope you found this useful again and keep up the great work with

757
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,800
the highly source code. And I'll hopefully talk to you later. All right, dude. Thank you very much.

758
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Hey, Brams, you guys. I'm going to be playing some different genres of pod save music.

759
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,960
Had a great time this morning now that I could download really fast and skin through all the new

760
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:52,360
submissions to music.podshow.com. Here's restless for the sun. Jimmy Bratcher on your daily source code.

761
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:13,000
All right, I'll lay me down to sleep tonight, toss and turn, sleep on car,

762
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,800
restless for the sun.

763
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:38,120
A dream a dream with you in view. Better times and dreams come true.

764
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:52,520
As wide open tell me where's the dawn. Restless for the sun.

765
00:34:52,520 --> 00:35:07,960
The view from here. Don't darken. It's shout so clear in my mind.

766
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:19,960
Don't break in through darkness. Dreams come true. Better times.

767
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,000
So hold me close. Speak to me.

768
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:46,440
For the dreams we've yet to see. Can't wait to see you when the morning comes.

769
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,640
Restless for the sun.

770
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:28,840
So hold me close. Speak to me.

771
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:45,080
For the dreams we've yet to see. Can't wait to see you when the morning comes.

772
00:36:45,880 --> 00:37:02,920
Restless for the sun. Restless for the sun.

773
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,400
Isn't that pretty? It's almost unbelievable. As the sun was playing the sun,

774
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,800
broke through on the eastern side of the day and just started to burn away. Some of those fog and

775
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,120
clouds really, really, really nice. Just wrapping up the aviation part of the show here.

776
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:32,680
I heard that many airlines are going to allow cell phones to work in the air while you're flying.

777
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,480
What a crazy world we live in. 10 years ago,

778
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,600
even less than that, having your own private airplane meant that you could actually make phone calls from

779
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:50,760
the air. That was like the hot shit. These days, or in the very near future, you're going to want

780
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,760
to have your own private airplane so you don't have to listen to some dickheads sitting next to you.

781
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm against that. I'm way against that. That's not a good idea. Because you really don't notice

782
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,640
the cell phone culture walking around on the street. People don't use their cell phones and

783
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,160
meetings that much, but occasionally, want to ring or you know, it won't be unviberate mode and

784
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,560
they'll start skipping across the table. But otherwise, people use cell phones pretty much everywhere.

785
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,640
You know, in restaurants, in stores and at ball games, in the movie theaters. Oh, man. I don't

786
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:28,120
know, I'm not for this. This is a bad trend. Good trends are coming out of Los Angeles.

787
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,760
It was intended for mature audiences and may contain some language like pee. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,

788
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,360
hold on. This, this warning is for real, okay? If you have your kids around, turn the volume down

789
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:44,520
or stick it in your ear. Kaka, doo-doo, and the occasional fucking do-spag cock sucker.

790
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,720
Holy shit, and hot, damn, Mark. You know, Shemoto and MCOP from Pacific Coast,

791
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,680
Hellway. Hey, Adam, I just want to let you and the daily source code listeners know that after

792
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,520
months of begging and pleading by myself and the listeners here on the highway, we finally got Sarah,

793
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,360
the 21-year-old virgin, to call in to our message line and leave her self-induced orgasm.

794
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,720
Hey, sorry, call me a tease, but that's all he get for now. However, we will be playing her

795
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,880
entire one minute and 43 second long orgasm on Pacific Coast, Hellway, on Thursday show.

796
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,560
So, come with us on Sarah's journey into the realization of her own dormant sexuality.

797
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,000
Hey, I'm telling you, her orgasm is so hot, it made me harder than Chinese arithmetic.

798
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,920
Wait, hold on, let me play that again. Oh, hey, Adam, I know it gets lonely there,

799
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,160
a curry condo away from your beloved, so I especially invite you and the daily source code

800
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,800
listeners to light a few candles and get ready for a virtual visit from our own lovely Sarah,

801
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,440
the 21-year-old virgin. Hey, now what you do during the show is between you,

802
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,120
whatever God you believe in and U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. We at the Hellway aren't here

803
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,840
to judge, we're just here to provide you with stuff nobody else can. All I'm saying is that after

804
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:09,160
I post tomorrow's show, I'm buying stock and clean eggs. So, come, check us out of Pacific Coast Hellway.

805
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:16,280
You can find us on the iTunes Music Store under Pacific Coast Hellway or at Pacific Coast Hellway.com.

806
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:22,360
Adam, stay groovy, a big lug. This is Martin Yoshimodo, an MCOT signing off. So let's all get home safe

807
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,360
and let's meet at Pacific Coast Hellway and talk about some more shit. I'm out.

808
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,960
Harder than Chinese arithmetic? I know that one, I like it. I'm out. I'm supposed to invite him

809
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,280
up this week. We'll have to do it next week then. Have to see if you can come, I really want to meet

810
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,360
this guy in his Pacific Hell Coast players. They've got something going on down there in Los Angeles.

811
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,920
Very cool. Hey, all-time radio, it really never won away. In fact, it's alive and vibrant at the

812
00:40:46,920 --> 00:41:08,760
small world. Oh, the lone ranger. Oh, the lone ranger. Yes, when you hear that

813
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:16,360
going to be hard, it's the lone ranger. In those days, you sat back and your imagination took

814
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:22,760
over and you created your own images of the characters that you listened to. I Adam,

815
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,560
visit your show here from the small world podcast. Like yourself, I'm a big fan of all-time

816
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,880
radio theater. On today's small world podcast, I had the pleasure of talking with Radio Hall of

817
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,600
Famer, Fred Foie. Fred was the voice of such classics as the announcer of the lone ranger,

818
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,080
the green hornet, and the dick-evite show as well as narrating dozens of documentaries. I invite

819
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,840
you and everyone else to listen to Fred as he shares some of the moments from his great career

820
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,960
in radio at smallworldpodcast.com as always. Stay tuned.

821
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:15,640
And I produce a weekly pod safe music podcast called Robert Smooth Music. If you're tired of radio

822
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:23,320
and junk food mainstream music, RSM is for you, there are great artists out there. They're just

823
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:33,960
hard to find. That's the mission of RSM. You'll find a coherent mix of indie rock, folk, pop,

824
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:40,360
world, and beyond. In addition to great music, you'll appreciate the fact that your host,

825
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:49,960
that's me, Robert Smooth, is quiet, bland, and inoffensive. Basically, I'm a big bore who loves to

826
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:58,040
play great tunes without a bunch of a name chatter. Just great music. I invite you to give

827
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:09,720
the show a listen. Visit my web page at robbysmovemusic.blogspot.com or search for RSM in iTunes.

828
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,280
Enjoy Robert Smooth Music. Ciao.

829
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,880
Right, the exact opposite of me. I have all the in-game chatter. What does that guy say?

830
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:28,520
All right, time for something that is really American. If you hate country, skip ahead for four

831
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,520
minutes. He has rusty blue and bill Anderson.

832
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:08,520
Please me, and baby, it's starting to hurt. There's not enough feeling when you kiss me,

833
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:17,160
not in the fourth and your touch. There seems to be a whole lot of little things,

834
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:32,040
chipping away and I love. Chipping away, chipping away and I love. One little too little,

835
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:41,000
three little problems, pretty seeing you and I'm all up. And all the King's horses and all the

836
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
King's men, couldn't put us back together again. We got a star, star, star, star,

837
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,040
chipping away, chipping away and I love.

838
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:16,120
You used to leave me a little of nose, lying all around the house. Then you used to laugh at all of my jokes,

839
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:25,080
but nothing's worth of fun in that. There's not enough feeling when you kiss me,

840
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:33,560
not in the fourth and your touch. There seems to be a whole lot of little things,

841
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:44,600
chipping away and I love. One little too, chipping away and I love.

842
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:56,920
One little too little, three little problems, pretty seeing you and I'm all up. And all the King's horses and

843
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:05,320
all the King's men, couldn't put us back together again. We got a star, star, star,

844
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:22,440
chipping away and I love. Chipping away and I love. Chipping away and I love. One little too little,

845
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:31,480
three little, four little, pretty seeing you and I'm all up. And all the King's horses and all the

846
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:39,400
King's men couldn't put us back together again. We got a star, star, star, star,

847
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:48,040
chipping away and I love. Now there's got to be some source code listening on an interstate

848
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:55,640
somewhere I say, yeah, finally. It's my dirty little secret. I love country music. I really do.

849
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:03,960
It's so pure America. It doesn't exist anywhere else really in that it just country. It's

850
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,960
great country and jazz, man. Those are, I mean, country and jazz. Jesus Christ, my headphone is

851
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,760
shot. I think I have to purchase a new one. I've blown this one out by cranking that volume up too

852
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,440
loud. Another thing that's going to kill me, I'm sure. So that was a whole long second. Of course,

853
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,200
I immediately went past a chip chip chip. Rusty blue with Bill Anderson straight off the

854
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:32,200
pod safe music network, which is great. Just shows that there is more out there than you would

855
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,480
presume from something that's independent, but you heard the problem before that. I mean,

856
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,760
this is what's happening. This is a, oh, man, I sound like a broken record. By the way, you know what you

857
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:46,680
get when, when you spin country and Western music backwards, right? I wonder if you can do that

858
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,760
with Megasake. Can you reverse it? Let me say if you can reverse. No, no, you can probably do it in

859
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,680
quick time. But do that for yourself. But what happens when you, when you spin country and Western

860
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,640
music backwards is you get your house back and get your wife back, your dog is undead.

861
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,200
DailySourceco.com is where you can find the latest episode of this particular podcast. You can

862
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,200
subscribe to it if you're using iTunes. It's a real easy way to keep track of your podcast. It's a
