1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Daily Source Code for February 16, 2005.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey everybody, coming to you almost live from New York, it's the Daily Source Code.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And it is the middle of the night.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's, uh, what is it?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
115 coming to you from the Hilton on six half a noon.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Good every source code.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A little bit late, but, uh, it's still kind of Wednesday.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Wednesday night.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hi there.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I've got the, uh, wireless microphone.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I've got the wireless microphone.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I've just turned this down a little bit.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't have my earphones in.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Uh, just got back from the Louis Sivius Bitty Show.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And I wanted to make sure that I, uh, recorded the source code now.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So I could, uh, really give you the whole essence of, of what the show was about.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And, you know, just really make sure that, uh, that I got everything out.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've got a second to give you the, this here.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I'm like, my chain is also hitting the microphone.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hold up.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hold up.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hold up.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hold up.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hold up.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
As you can tell, um, it's severely jet lag.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Uh, arrived around, uh, what's on again around 1130s when I arrived at Newark Airport.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Really happy I was able to go to Newark, by the way.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's such a superior airport if you need to get to Manhattan.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you want to drive in, drive as much quicker.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's much less congested.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's a modern airport.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I really love it to British airway.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So I'm in my room.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And, uh, just got back.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I missed a whole bunch, right?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So the part that I missed is that I walked through the gates.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is the famous, uh, art, um, in central park that everyone's talking about.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The whole city is basically filled to the health with people who, um, who've come to New York.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Just to see these, these gates with orange pieces of fabric.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I'm not saying it's pretty impressive.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Excuse me.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And it is completely art.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's certainly, you know, listening a lot of response from, uh, from the natives.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm, uh, just cleaning up some stuff because I was in my, even out of my room.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A couple times.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And haven't really had a chance to, well, hung up my clothes as Patricia always tells me to do.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You know, hung up the shirts and, uh, and the jackets.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Uh, so anyway, um, had a meeting this afternoon and then had some dinner.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And then went to, uh, Joe's pub, uh, which was down, was a 24th street, I think.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And, uh, packed house sold out.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It was sold out 20 minutes before the show started.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And on stage, there they were, my, my girls, the city's beauties.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And holy crap.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What an amazing, amazing show.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So bear in mind that I'm open with a mini bar here.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Please come with me.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's see what we have.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I want you some water.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Bear in mind that, uh, even though I've been talking about the bitties and, and then talking about me and their own podcast,

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
viddycast.com, by the way, officially launched as of today.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We've never met.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's kind of like, I guess kind of like meeting a penpal.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What do I mean?

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Where, um, you've been in, in contact.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In this case, we've been in contact for, actually, I was talking to Leanne about that.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Um, I actually knew them before they even had done their first album.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And she somewhere has, I forget who it was who turned me on to them.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Um, but we've totally known each other for quite a while and, and man, things are just popping open for them.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's so cool.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It really is, um, uh, what's the, uh, reporter from CBS News was in the audience tonight,

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
uh, Sharon Alfonci.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Uh, she was, she was, uh, and he created.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Uh, I see there was someone from the Economist, someone from the New York Times.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I mean, LeCivius Bitties are go as far as I'm concerned.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Um, so I just wanted to, you know, talk a little bit about their show, um, before I go to bed.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Uh, and hopefully tomorrow, uh, be able to do, uh, a longer, more full version of the source code.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And boy, shit is piling up.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I see that I have 264 messages in my regular Gmail account and another 50 MP3 feedback.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, uh, and of course, there's hit tests and, well, I guess you just, you want, why don't I do that?

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Um, I will definitely, you know, me, uh,

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
it's a thing with Google.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Of course, you got a log out of one account to get into the other.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Um, and, uh, by the way, I have to say the Wi-Fi at the Hilton is excellent.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And she, 995 for 24 hours.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Uh, and you don't have to, you know, put your credit card.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It goes right along on your hotel bill.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can sign up per 24 hours.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Very impressive.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Work great.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's see if you don't pull that, put in a hit test.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sure you did.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We'll do as we'll do the hit test.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's always fun.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hold on.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let me see if you, uh, oh yeah.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Number, cheese.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Did I miss number 10?

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I haven't even done number 10 yet.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So I'll do number 10.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm going to start downloading that.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Um, and so that'll be ready.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Um, so obviously I want to play some, uh,

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the city is bitty's tunes for you.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Haven't played it in a while have threatened to several times.

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Uh, and by the way, I'm going to hook up with the girls on Saturday.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We'll have some coffee, uh, in town.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Although they're trying to get me out the queens to Sesame Street, where, uh,

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
where they live.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They say they live in Sesame Street.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I totally believe it.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So young poets hit test is downloading.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
In the meantime, let me see.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What should I play for you?

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Um,

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm going to play neighbor.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've known this song ever since, uh,

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
well, ever since I got the CD.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Um, it's from their second album.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I, and I didn't know exactly what the song was about.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Nor did I really think about it.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Um, but tonight on stage, um,

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
um, actually Saskia, uh, told the story.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Uh, about the song that Leanne wrote.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It was, uh, she used to really as a kid.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She used to love, uh, Mr. Rogers.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And when he would come on TV and say hi neighbor,

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
she would sit there and say hi neighbor.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And she would talk back.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And of course, kids are like that, right?

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And it's totally, it's totally logical that, uh,

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
that she would really think that that was her neighbor.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And then she had a, uh, some kind of contact with him.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, and through the, the magic of television.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And when he passed away, she was upset and wrote this song.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And I'm so happy that I now know the story behind it.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because it really gives the words new meaning.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Here's the piece of it.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Just, just, just you.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You switched to a sweater and said,

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How do you do neighbor?

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How do you do?

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I remember the look in your sparkle eyes.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That said clearly, I love you.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't do it like nice neighbor.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You saw me looking at you.

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll picture picture up on the wall of the old street.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I'm in tall and I'm everywhere.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Go round.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Spin it away, Charlie.

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh, Charlie.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Where did you go today?

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Where we played with Santa.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Where for walks in the park.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You were a gentle man.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We were home in front of the neighbor.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Me, delivery.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Make me feel free.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Chef rocket showed us how to bake a pie.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, lady, Elaine gave him an evil eye, neighbor.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You never acted that way.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
In the whole world, you said there's only one need.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I didn't your world.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I was happy to be your neighbor.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, with the wood with lady, I believe.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Lady, I believe.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
She was so pretty.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I came home today with all weight on my mind.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Life isn't simple anymore.

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But I know where I can find you.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You said there's only one need.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I didn't your world.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I was happy to be your neighbor.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, with the wood with lady, I believe.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, the whole world.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You said there's only one need in your world.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was happy to be your neighbor.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, with the wood with lady, I believe.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Lady, I believe.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
She was so pretty.

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you, friend.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
She was so pretty.

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Ah, the serious bitties and neighbor on the daily source code for Wednesday,

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
even though it's technically Thursday.

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But it's what we'll just call it Wednesday, the 16th of February, 2005.

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The big New York trip hanging out, meeting with the friends,

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
neighbors, old businesses, associates.

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Just having a little good chill in New York.

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's a great time to be here.

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Too bad a little bit of rain pumped up the end of the day.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But it was actually quite nice.

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It was like 60, yeah, 58, 59, 60 degrees.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let me see if I can open a window here.

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Since I'm producing smoke, it might actually be nice.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's see if we can hear some New York sounds.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay, let's see if I can make this a little open.

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, that's working.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's do this out.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm on the 30 second floor.

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We're not here too much from the street.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's kind of quiet right now.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
New York quiet, right?

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Ah, boy, boy, boy.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So I'm going to have to make it pretty short for today.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And tomorrow, I've also got all kinds of stuff planned.

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And so hopefully I have some guests on the show.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, really?

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can get the videos on Saturday.

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We're going to try and hook up with them Saturday.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And see if we can get them on the podcast.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So, what should we do?

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's do the hit test.

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Just to do it, this is going to be a wacky source code.

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's for sure.

225
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Almost can't live a day without young bullets.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
One guest.

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm going to read my mama always said that hit test was lock a box of chocolates.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You never know what you're going to get.

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Time for Adam Curry to take the hit test with young bullet.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hi, Adam.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey, young.

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Here's the thin edition of the hit test.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Didn't we already do this?

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And if you're ready, we're going to start right away.

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So here we go.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This is number one.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Have a feeling of done this.

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now we've done this one.

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Shoot.

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, so I'm like, I've heard this.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Isn't this.

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, it's magic.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, see.

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I knew I missed that mess that up.

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Hold on.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Let's see.

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, hot test number 11.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay.

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Shoot.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
All right.

252
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So I have to download this.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That'll just take me a minute.

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I was also a fun.

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There were two.

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Actually, there were a whole bunch of people who came.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Who knew what podcasting was and had heard about the bitty cast or heard about the show on this podcast or other podcasts.

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Two guys from Holland who've been working in Connecticut.

259
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
New Canaan actually, which is a reasonable drive.

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They came down and they're souped up Mustang.

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
These guys are working for some.

262
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They're they're code slingers basically.

263
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And they'd heard it on the source code.

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And they got told to turn on to the bitty's and.

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
There are a lot of.

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, there's a lot of podcasts really in people, which is really cool to see.

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But there was an audience there that is very familiar with the CBS bitties.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They are definitely the bomb, diggy, shizzle, fizzle, and new way of our york.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's a podcasting with Adam Curry.

270
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's time for Adam Curry to take the hip test.

271
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
With your polette.

272
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hi, Adam.

273
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is your edition of the hit test.

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And again, music from the 80s, it should be part safe.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Because questions and answers are well within 60 seconds each.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, you know what, y'all, I love it when you play by the rules.

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay.

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Excuse me.

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm recording here.

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What are you doing?

281
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What are you doing?

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Excuse me.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Give me back the mic.

284
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Come on.

285
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Give me back.

286
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What are you doing?

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Come on.

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What are you doing?

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Hello, Adam.

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, I'll give you a hint.

291
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's like a hot pussy.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
All right.

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, I've decided that I was a little tired.

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yons, hitting his Dutch accent.

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And I've decided to take over the hit test myself.

296
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Are you ready?

297
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm ready, baby.

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hey, hit this.

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This is number one.

300
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, shoot.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I know this one too.

302
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Free your mind.

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Free your mind.

304
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And your dress will follow.

305
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And vote.

306
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is number two.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I told you that.

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can make you feel good.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Was that Shalomar?

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's got to be a big lesbian song.

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was probably Shalomar.

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I can make you feel good.

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think that's what it was.

314
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
All right.

315
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's keep going.

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And this is number three.

317
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Um.

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Is it.

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Uh.

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
S.O.S.B.

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The chain.

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And now here's Yon with the answers.

323
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
First of all.

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Madge.

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Thank you very much.

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That was a great surprise.

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So I guess you don't know anything about music, eh?

328
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Give me.

329
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Give me that.

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry for this interruption.

332
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's like you.

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I wasn't able to start over again.

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh.

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, okay.

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Here we go.

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And to number one.

338
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Free your mind.

339
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And your dress will follow.

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And vote.

341
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And for your mind.

342
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's one for the kid.

343
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll wait.

344
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll call him.

345
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll kill you.

346
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What?

347
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He doesn't need it.

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm a friend to tell.

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah.

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
No.

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh.

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh.

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh.

354
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh.

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh.

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh.

357
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh.

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh.

359
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh.

360
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

361
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Real mind.

362
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And the last.

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And answer number two.

364
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And this is Johnny H. Jazz.

365
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh.

366
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Sure.

367
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't want to be a hero.

368
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh.

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I can make you feel good.

370
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Johnny.

371
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I can.

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But.

373
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The only Johnny H. Jazz song I know is a shadow dreams.

374
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And something else.

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But shadow dreams.

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I wouldn't have guessed this.

377
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

378
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't want to be a hero.

379
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't want to be a hero.

381
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't want to be a hero.

383
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah.

384
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't want to be a hero.

385
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And the final answer.

386
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The SOS band.

387
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The secret of success band.

388
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And the song is titled Just Being Good To Me.

389
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh.

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I got like a half a point.

391
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Tell me.

392
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't care.

393
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't care.

394
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh.

395
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Just being good to me.

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Woo.

397
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, that's it.

398
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Match.

399
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What are you still doing here?

400
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Why are you so close to me?

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Get away.

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let me do this.

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Boy, what are you doing?

404
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Are you just not supposed to see?

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

406
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Is it my podcast?

407
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
At the least radio.

408
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah.

409
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Now you're pushing it, match.

410
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And I'm sorry again for these interruptions.

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let me wrap it up before other things go wrong here.

412
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

413
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Bye-bye.

418
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yo.

419
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Most excellent young.

420
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Thank you once again for a wonderful.

421
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Wonderful job there.

422
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The theater of the mind.

423
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The amazing.

424
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
How managed can transport herself to the Netherlands.

425
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Let's help at hand.nl-hittest.htt-t-e-s-t.

426
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
For the archive of all of the young-pled hittest.

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I think you sent me some email about the RSS feed and stuff.

428
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But I just got to find an hour or two to catch up on on my correspondence.

429
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's what's just fricking crazy.

430
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You go.

431
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's why I need a producer.

432
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
By the way, I've had a couple of people send me emails and I've had some correspondence with the couple of them.

433
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And I really appreciate it.

434
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And sometimes, hopefully, maybe the weekend, I'll be able to get back to you guys.

435
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Because there's some real, real town that's competent people who want to help.

436
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And best of all, they just want to help.

437
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I really appreciate it.

438
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Actually, I wanted to mention these two guys that came down from a Connecticut.

439
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Let me just see.

440
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I got to get their card from my jacket.

441
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They're really nice guys.

442
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And they said, let me see if I can find it here.

443
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Hold on a second.

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Shoot when I put there.

445
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
They had a website.

446
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And they had pictures from the bitty show, which is apparently running on, here we go.

447
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's running on their cable modem at their apartment.

448
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I said, but, you know, dude, if I point to this, you know, that could get pretty nasty with your 300k upstream.

449
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But they're really, they're hackers that thought it would be funny.

450
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But it's Dutch.Hop2.org.

451
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Dutch.Hop2, H-O-P-T-O, or hotel.

452
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Or is it a hotel Oscar Papa Tango Oscar.org?

453
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Okay.

454
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's see.

455
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I want to play another bitty track.

456
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This is actually from the bittycastbittycast.com.

457
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I think this is a previous live show.

458
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is going to be a little chaotic because we just turned on the recorder.

459
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Let me see that.

460
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I want the live show.

461
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Now, this is what I want.

462
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Here's a bit of the live show.

463
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This is a Texas girl.

464
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This is Lee Ann's got this beautiful country and western line.

465
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes, it's a good song.

466
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah.

467
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000

499
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,840
like a Bitty Promotion Show. Man, it was so fun when you, so I told you, it's kind of like

500
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,680
pen pals, and I finally met them, and we all hugged, and these are, they're like kind of like

501
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,320
kind of a no-potite, you know, they're, they're not a one as over five, five, I think, and they're

502
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,960
just, oh man, I don't know, it was great, just the whole show, and there's great scenes Saskia

503
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,960
where they're upright-based, that's some, you know what, you know, me and, you know, and big wood

504
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,560
instruments and women, right? Or, you know, string instruments like the upright base or some hot

505
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,200
girl on cello action, you know, that really gets my blood pumping, and Saskia was just, oh man,

506
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:05,480
she's a julyard, I think she's, she graduated julyard on a scholarship, but the way she was just

507
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,960
hammering on that upright base was a very physical thing, she was just cool to watch, and then

508
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:19,720
Vidi Amanda on guitar, rocking out, Deedra on, on piano and Leanne, of course, on vocals,

509
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,480
and, oh, those girls just make such beautiful music. It was fun, you know, we hung out,

510
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,800
had a drink afterwards, and Saturday was, as I said, we're gonna try and hook up. So also,

511
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,440

512
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,480

513
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,400
that people have been emailing me and calling me about, and so I find decided I might as well go

514
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,680
and just talk to people and see, see what some of the ideas are, there's a lot of old business

515
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:57,080
socios of mine have popped up with ideas, marketing, advertising people, it's just, it's a

516
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,840
