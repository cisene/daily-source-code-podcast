1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Delta Shara Charly 2100.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's July 18, 2005.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How you doing, everybody?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage on Monday,

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
18 July, it's a five minutes past two in the afternoon.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's the daily source code to show that we try to bring you every weekday.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And you think it about three out of five.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But enjoy an every time I do.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It looks like Europe is getting a cool down.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The heat wave seems to be dying down just a little bit.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're looking at 23 degrees Celsius today or centigrade.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Everyone wants to say it.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's nice.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A little bit of sunshine, a little bit of cool wind.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The continent is even a little bit cooler.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So a nice refreshing break from what we've had.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Although the weekend was absolutely stunning.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Man, we have a great weekend or what.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
At least here we did in the UK.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So Saturday, I sat inside and worked on pie pod finder episode number two,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which would be released tomorrow on iTunes.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's unbelievable.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's unbelievable.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What's really cool is we have no network time that we have to have to adhere to.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This thing just keeps getting longer on like,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
oh man, we're almost an hour.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But I think you like it.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So that'll be released tomorrow.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And yesterday we had some guests over.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So we hung out a little bit when in the town.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It was nice and quiet because the big deal fest was taking place.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Gilfest is a big music festival in Gilford.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I think takes place every year and status quo were one of the headlines.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It was very cool.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And nice dinner last night and rested up.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, went to bed a little bit too late.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But we're ready to crank it out for you.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've got all kinds of promos, pod safe music.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
News about the pod safe music network.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And actually have a backtrack podcast.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So stay tuned for that as we roll out the mash up for it today.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Bangers and mash.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Calling it bad.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So scum.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And he can't stop but stop.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And he can't stop but stop.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Holding up to forever your group.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We don't think it all have been right here right now.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Holding up to forever your group.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We don't think it all have been right here right now.

51

Holding up to forever your group.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We don't think it all have been right here right now.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Holding up to forever your group.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We don't think it all have been right here right now.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going to welcome you all to have fun.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now he is.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And it's good to talk.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I make it to my new meeting.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So take your time.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Grab a train.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But we got food to see it.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now we're down to get your news.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Please give my head.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
People see my name.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There's more.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They make it.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And they mean it.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
From the future.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
From the new division.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You know what?

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Even you can read it back.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And your little life.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Or she has broken it more.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hey man.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A blessing on her head.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Say again.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And I've been.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
On that topic.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We got it in agreement.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000

189
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We got it in agreement.

190
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We got it in agreement.

191
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We got to get it in agreement.

192
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We got to get it in agreement.

193
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We got it in agreement.

194
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We got it in agreement.

195
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We got it in agreement.

196
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We got it in agreement.

197
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We got it in agreement.

198
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We got it.

199
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We got it.

200
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We got it in agreement.

201
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We got it in agreement.

202
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We got it in agreement.

203
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We got it.

204
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We got it.

205
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We got that.

206
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We got it in agreement.

207
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We got it in agreement.

208
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We got it in agreement.

209
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We got it in agreement.

210
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We got it in agreement.

211
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We got it.

212
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,960
Oh man, I had that cranked up on the speakers here.

213
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm sure Patricia heard that downstairs.

214
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,800
Hey everybody, let me see.

215
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,760
I was gonna talk about a couple of things.

216
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,800
First of all, about the new geek toy I got,

217
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,800
the MDA3, which is this PDA phone Wi-Fi Bluetooth Mega Box.

218
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,000
Spend lots of times since I picked it up,

219
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,440
which was, what was it last Wednesday,

220
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,400
if there's, I think, configuring it.

221
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
And I, wow, there's a lot of software available

222
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,000
for, for pocket PC, that's unbelievable.

223
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
I had no idea.

224
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,560
And there's all kinds of GPS programs.

225
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,680
There's lots of aviation software,

226
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
which of course I'm totally big.

227
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,640
And I don't have a GPS unit yet.

228
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,840
I got it, I haven't really hunted around yet.

229
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,200
First thing I did was look for better carrying cases

230
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,080
because it's too big.

231
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
It's really too big for a phone to be a phone.

232
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,280
Unless you can slip it into your pocket.

233
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,120
But, I don't know, I kind of like the idea

234
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,840
of, I'd rather carry something around.

235
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,720
If I'm, if I'm carrying everything

236
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,760
and this thing does everything, since it has Wi-Fi,

237
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,560
it's got Skype, I configured the email client

238
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,560
to work with Gmail, which is kind of a mindbender

239
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,520
because you can set up Gmail in different ways.

240
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Excuse me.

241
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,560
One is, and actually this is the way I have it set up.

242
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,840
Once you've accessed your email through the Pop3 client,

243
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,360
then it automatically archives that email

244
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,800
and throws it into, well, keeps it in your inbox, obviously.

245
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,440
Oh, by the way, guys, thank you very much.

246
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,360
Infinity plus one seems to be happening my,

247
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,720
the size of my email box is growing right along side

248
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,200
with the size of the files that are coming in.

249
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,360
I wonder if that's automatic or if that's just

250
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,280
coincidence or if they heard me bitching about it over Google.

251
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,240
So I'm now 96% I'm doing okay.

252
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Thank you.

253
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,320
So now on the Pocket PC, which, of course,

254
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,840
you can use with GPRS as well as Wi-Fi,

255
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,120
you don't want to just pull down everything,

256
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,640
because that means you could be sitting there for quite a while

257
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,200
as it pulls down MP3 attachments or anything like that.

258
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,960
So you can receive headers only on your email.

259
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,840
This is not gonna last too long as GIG talk,

260
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
I promise, but I just want to get this out.

261
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,280
So the trick kind of is, if, okay, so you read it

262
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,080
and then you have to, you have to mark it for download.

263
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,440
If it's already downloaded, it'll show you that.

264
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,600
And then if you wanna do something with it,

265
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,000
you gotta reply then.

266
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
Because the next time you connect,

267
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,400
because you've read it, it then automatically disappears

268
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,680
from both your Gmail inbox,

269
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,760
as well as on the inbox on the Pocket PC.

270
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,880
So it's a little bit of a mind vendor

271
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
or once you figure out how to work with it,

272
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,120
it's really nice.

273
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
It's a great way to synchronize your mail,

274
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,560
but it did take me a few minutes

275
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,480
to kind of figure out what was going on there.

276
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,160
And I've used the Skype capability quite a bit.

277
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,960
I like that.

278
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,680
It's just an amazing amount of software

279
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
that you can get for this thing.

280
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,960
It's, I have to say, it's pretty darn cool.

281
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
And quite a bit better than the last time

282
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,480
I tried out a Pocket PC, which I think was

283
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,800
six or seven years ago, was like an HP,

284
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,200
one of those plastic things.

285
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
And, you know, of course there was no,

286
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
no network card had used dial up.

287
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
And that was just, it was horrible.

288
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,520
I just synchronized with your PC at home

289
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,360
or something like that.

290
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,920
So, they've come a long way, baby.

291
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,080
Have you ever looked at the world

292
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,320
and wondered how things got to be the way they are?

293
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm mad to tell a little of Matt's today in history.

294
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,560
And it's my mission to answer that question.

295
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,200
I tried to bring a little light to the events

296
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,240
of the past with a short informative podcast

297
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,280
that will hopefully enlighten you and form you.

298
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,680
And maybe even send you on your own journey of discovery.

299
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,800
You can find Matt's today in history

300
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,280
at opaquelycity.com.

301
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,280
That's OPA, QUE, LUC, IDITY.com.

302
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,960
If you use iTunes, do a search for Matt.

303
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
Bring it a little, we'll get straight to your world

304
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
with Matt's today in history.

305
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Hi, Joe.

306
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,400
Content that will make you walk the dog

307
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,920
and kiss your mother.

308
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,920
Once upon a time, they'll use the jackroom and a deer.

309
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
They transformed me.

310
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,640
Jack, scared.

311
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,520
On the best phone cards, around.

312
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,480
Joyce, I don't even know you don't.

313
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,760
She, you, she just don't call.

314
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,280
Slash soybean, essay, U-E-R-B-E-A-N.

315
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,320
Slash in next door, H-D-A-M-L.

316
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
It's absolutely splendid.

317
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,280
Thank you for listening and good night.

318
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,560
Ha ha ha.

319
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,400
That's jack.

320
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,800
I've been emailing back and forth of the jack.

321
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,960
He's 14 or 15.

322
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,520
And his dad won't give us credit card

323
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,160
so that he can register with iTunes

324
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,120
so that he can then actually register his podcast

325
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,440
in iTunes, which is a bummer.

326
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,520
Is that true?

327
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,640
Do you have to have an account with iTunes in order to submit?

328
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,600
I thought you could just submit it without being a paying member

329
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,880
of iTunes or the iTunes music store, not to be short about it.

330
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,120
But I didn't think, obviously, I can't tell anymore

331
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,120
because all my computers already are logged in

332
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,760
and already synced up to the Apple stuff.

333
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,000
So today's Monday, Wednesday, I'm off to San Francisco.

334
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,680
We've got some really exciting news to announce.

335
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,720
Of course, today, no damn announcements.

336
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,760
The NDA is in effect.

337
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,400
But somewhere probably a Thursday or maybe Friday

338
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,640
will be announcing some very exciting news for Pod Show

339
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,000
and everyone involved with Pod Show.

340
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,600
So excited about that and looking forward to a nice trip

341
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
over.

342
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,240
I'll be saying, I'm going to take my,

343
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,080
a lot of work on the plane.

344
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm going to do the Virgin upper class thing again.

345
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,680
I really did like that.

346
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
I was pretty good.

347
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,600
It doesn't, it doesn't compare at all to their cell phones.

348
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Which has, you know, sucks.

349
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,360
And I've moved over to T-Mobile.

350
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,080
By the way, that phone that was blacklisted,

351
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,520
it's still blacklisted, you know?

352
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,560
How many times, well, I called four times,

353
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,400
went to the store once and I forget about it.

354
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,240
It's not going to happen.

355
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
They just don't care about me.

356
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,040
So I hope it won't be too long a trip.

357
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
I think probably a week or so.

358
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,920
Maybe on the way back, I think actually I have on the way

359
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,320
back, I'll have to hit New York because it's just so much

360
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,480
to be done.

361
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,960
And so many people to hook up with who we've been talking

362
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,920
with over the past couple of weeks or pump out past couple

363
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,720
of months actually.

364
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
On the way in the source code today,

365
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,320
we've got the backtracks podcast in lieu of a young

366
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,440
bullet hit test, spoke to Jan over the past week.

367
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
And he's kind of got other like nine weeks

368
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,240
that he's in this rehabilitation place.

369
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,440
But he sounded great and hey, you know,

370
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,520
he's got his Wi-Fi, he's got his laptop,

371
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,960
he's got his headphone and microphone,

372
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,200
he's got his gas blaster.

373
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,600
So I'm looking forward to probably have another hit test

374
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
from Jan this week.

375
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
See what else?

376
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,960
Oh, and of course, I news about the pod safe music network.

377
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,760
That's all coming up.

378
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,600
Hey Adam, this is Brendan over at the radio brand

379
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,960
domain podcast at brandomand.com.

380
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,720
I just want to say what's up.

381
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,040
And I love your pod cast when listen to it.

382
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,280
Since I was a back in China in October,

383
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,040
I just recently found out because some guy

384
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,880
was asking me because he's in China now.

385
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,160
He's podcasting and he thought he was the first guy.

386
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
The pod cast from China.

387
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
And I guess I was.

388
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,360
And I didn't even know that.

389
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,280
So I guess that's sort of cool.

390
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,000
You know what I'm saying?

391
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
That's actually interesting.

392
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,720
I just heard that China is starting to really big radio deals.

393
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,360
And they're starting to divvy up their spectrum in there.

394
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,680
So commercial broadcasts are now moving into that space.

395
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,160
It's going to be really interesting to watch because clearly

396
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,640
pod casting was there before, as far as I know,

397
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,520
before a commercial broadcasters.

398
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,600
So this being a, I think, I don't know about China if it's

399
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,640
like Japan, if they're completely digitized.

400
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,800
I don't know about that.

401
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,520
But it'll be interesting to see what goes further faster

402
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,960
pod casting or broadcast.

403
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm back in Cali.

404
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,040
So I guess I can't say I'm pod casting from China anymore.

405
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,760
But I was for several episodes.

406
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,040
I recently became the co-owner of a independent record label

407
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,200
found at www.potloxmusic.com.

408
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,040
We support Christian artists who are Christians.

409
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,280
We don't want to have that CCM label.

410
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,280
If you read our mission statement, we're big on.

411
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,480
I don't exactly know what the CCM label is.

412
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,440
But it sounds like maybe there's a little bit of politics

413
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,280
going on in the Christian music scene.

414
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,760
We want to encourage Christians to create their own art,

415
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,720
not try to copy someone else, not try to just,

416
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,120
I mean, I'm sure you know a lot about the CCM industry

417
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,600
and what kind of cliche and crap it can be.

418
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,440
There you go.

419
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,680
No, I don't know a lot about the CCM industry.

420
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,200
I'd love to hear more.

421
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,960
And we want to kind of just encourage artists who are Christians

422
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,560
to make their own art and that's kind of our mission.

423
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,200
And we really want to stay independent.

424
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,320
And we really want to raise pod casting.

425
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,720
I want to create a pod cast for the label.

426
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,680
I'm interviewing some of our artists.

427
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,480
That have recorded with us and spotlighting some of the music.

428
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
And I also want to get it out there.

429
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,720
Get out, make a page, maybe, of some pod safe music

430
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,640
for people who put in their pod cast.

431
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,960
And I was wondering if any other tips you had,

432
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,720
I submitted some stuff to pod show,

433
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,280
but I didn't hear back on that.

434
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,120
I don't know.

435
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
I'm sure you get a ton of stuff.

436
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,680
So just want to hear any other tips you have

437
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,080
for the label owners who want to get their stuff out there

438
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,160
and embrace pod casting and digital distribution.

439
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,320
And anything else, any other tips you have

440
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,680
because you've been involved in this way long ago

441
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,240
and I have anyway, keep up the good work.

442
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,440
And I'm using a cast blaster right now.

443
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,720
So just out.

444
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,400
Oh, dude, that's awesome.

445
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,600
That goes a long way that point out.

446
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,400
I got the boring right there at my fingertips.

447
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,680
I've also tried out a pod producer.

448
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,400
So I was wondering if you've tried that out

449
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,080
because it's kind of similar to this.

450
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,720
And it's going to stay free.

451
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
And this doesn't look like it's going to stay free with.

452
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,960
That's cool.

453
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,800
I like this kind of has a little bit more features.

454
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,480
I mean, it's got the show notes and everything

455
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,200
that you can put in here and other stuff.

456
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,080
But I do like cast blaster.

457
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,400
And I think you're doing some great stuff out there.

458
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,920
Don't let the bass is grinding you down as Bono would say.

459
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,600
Anyway, take care, man.

460
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,720
And I'm glad to hear you were OK after the bombings and everything.

461
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,200
But my hearts go out to all those affected, including you and your family.

462
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,840
So take care, man.

463
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Let me see how to sit.

464
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Stop on this thing.

465
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
There you go.

466
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
OK.

467
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Good day.

468
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
All right.

469
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Thank you very much, Brendan.

470
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,120
Castblaster.com is where we can find the castblaster program.

471
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,360
And of course, anything that you heard in the show today,

472
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,640
you can find links to it in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com or www.curry.com.

473
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,680
Both sites soon to move to their new servers.

474
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:56,200
The weblogs being set up, Drew Domkis from Don Drew is doing the design for the Curry.com

475
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,240
site, which I'm really excited about.

476
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
And the wait until you see the daily source code also sent in just by a listener to the

477
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
source code.

478
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,640
So you're going to love that, but just to get all the servers rejiggered.

479
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,960
Now that we have now that the traffic issues have calmed down a bit and we've got our

480
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,200
optimization stuff all working.

481
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,000
We've got some other plans for distribution, which I'm hoping will benefit everybody.

482
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,120
So working on all of that.

483
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
And in reference to what Brendan was talking about, of course, we now have the Podsafe

484
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,880
Music Network, Podsafe Music Network.com.

485
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,200
You can also get it to it by typing in music.podshow.com.

486
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
It's going great.

487
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,320
And I think that I don't see why we wouldn't accept labels.

488
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,040
So what you should do is probably email ccchapman over accident hash accident hash.com or

489
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,000
info at Podsafe Music Network.com.

490
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,720
I think is also also works and probably I'm pretty sure a cc goes to cc, of course.

491
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
We should be able to do that.

492
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,240
We should be able to facilitate labels and we can work with you.

493
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,600
That shouldn't be a problem.

494
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,440
I was looking at the stats that cc sent me over the weekend, and this is up until Monday morning

495
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,040
169 artists have already signed up with the Podsafe Music Network and 309 podcasters.

496
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
This is fantastic.

497
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,160
And I've just been breezing through it and totally, totally loving all the new music

498
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
is in there.

499
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Just one click.

500
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
You know, you get it immediately.

501
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
Sample the stuff.

502
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,360
The links between what's being played, where it was played, what shows are playing, what

503
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
the top, the listens, the top pod play.

504
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Fantastic.

505
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm really enjoying it.

506
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,920
So I pick one, of course, today, which was one of the top rated ones.

507
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,440
So we'll get to that in a second right after this.

508
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,320
So my just got done listening to Daily Search, could number 208 with the feature of the

509
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,560
David course, the interview, and it reminded me of the sort of unique situation.

510
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Hold on a second.

511
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Yeah.

512
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
I should have set this up.

513
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
The David Coursey interview.

514
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,760
That's what I did on Friday I think.

515
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:59,720
It was Rob Greenley interviewing David Coursey, the longtime pendant in the technology

516
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,840
press, trade press.

517
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,440
And I got a lot of response to that.

518
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Let's listen to the comment.

519
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,800
We should have it work.

520
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,560
I work for a small media conglomerate in the United States, and I work at a particular TV

521
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,840
station in this media conglomerate that also has a radio station attached to it.

522
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,880
What's interesting is the TV news director represents sort of the David Coursey point

523
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,480
of view, which is I'm a long time media person and trust me blogging and podcasting

524
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:46,560
is where it's at, blogging is where it's at, Citizen Journalism is an important part.

525
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,480
And it's going to be an important part of our future media sort of set up.

526
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,600
I thought it was interesting, and I just thought I would let you know that I think this

527
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:04,000
in my opinion, at least the David Coursey point of view is the typical struggle against

528
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
a changing market.

529
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,920
These old school news guys can't recognize that the landscape of their future is changing

530
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:19,880
and they see the change and rather than try and adapt with the change they decide to attack

531
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:27,120
with the change, call it names, say that it's not called real news, close quote, say

532
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,000
that it's not legitimate, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, while those like

533
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
our radio news director can adapt and change with the changing market.

534
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,880
And they see the need for this new component to the news marketplace.

535
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,840
There's a place for his and journalism for this grass roots kind of journalism in

536
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,840
the form of podcasting and in the form of blogging that goes just hand in hand with

537
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,840
our, our, quote, traditional close quote media outlets.

538
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,840
And I think that those media outlets that don't recognize this are going to have to face the face

539
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,840
the music at some point and either adapt or die.

540
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Thank you.

541
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Thank you very much.

542
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,840
His voice, by the way, was changed to protect his identity.

543
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,840
So the person who sent that in was a nonny mouse.

544
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Well, it's going to get interesting.

545
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Rob Greenley ping me after I talked about that interview that he did with David Corsi.

546
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
And he of course wants interview me now.

547
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
So we'll do that.

548
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
We said a date for next Thursday.

549
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,840
So that'll be an IT conversation with the next couple of weeks.

550
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
And I'm not looking to pick any fights or anything.

551
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
I was just amazed.

552
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
It's okay.

553
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Everyone can have their own opinion, but I really thought David Corsi would see that there's

554
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
much more to it.

555
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Same goes for Mark Cuban, who also wrote a piece on his web log that said, you know,

556
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,840
podcasts are going to go nowhere.

557
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
This is, this is something different.

558
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
You know, this is, this is not like web logs.

559
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840
This is not the same thing.

560
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
This was created by listener demand,

561
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
not by publishing desire by listening demand.

562
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Of course publishing desire is a part of it because, you know, now that you can do it,

563
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
why not?

564
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
We might as well.

565
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Listener demand and just really shitty radio for the past 15 or 20 years is really what

566
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
created this.

567
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,840

Thanks a lot, Adam.

584
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Most of our high spots were coming to us now by TV.

585
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Sirius Central.

586
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
But not this one.

587
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Sirius 148.

588
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840

Tell this to everybody wherever they are.

592
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Sirius Central 148.

593
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Hi, this is Bruce Williams from audio to u.com.

594
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,840
We're not another podcast directorie.

595
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,840
At audio to u.com, we control the quality of our content by only working with the best people.

596
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
As I said.

597
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Why sing lyrical with Dom Romeo?

598
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,840
You're one of the few musicians who actually has a rhythm of beats named Arthur.

599
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
The bow did lead beats.

600
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Yeah, because I was the one who had been invented.

601
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
Fuzzy logic.

602
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
With Alex a horror off-road.

603
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Well, if they're all heavy and empty or all done in this case.

604
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,840
That's Bible where, but this is email recipient to be where.

605
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
And that was any Latin for that.

606
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
No, that's right.

607
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Email us.

608
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Beware us.

609
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Fun notes.

610
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Hi, Bruce.

611
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
This is punk rock.

612
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Patty Smith was recognized this week with an award.

613
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,840
She was awarded the command of the order of the arts and letters.

614
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Francis highest cultural honour.

615
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Building the pod.

616
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
So in terms of building your podcast.

617
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,840
The sorts of things you'll be able to do in audition will be record your voice.

618
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Stand and deliver.

619
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
I imagine in stand-up you get to fluff a lot of facts for the sake of the gag.

620
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,840
But when I read your books, you have a very real respect for knowledge.

621
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Where does this come from?

622
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
I do, but then a lot of it is also made up.

623
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
I mean, I like to.

624
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
I don't like novels.

625
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,840
So when you've had enough of the light fluff.

626
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
And then you get the good stuff.

627
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Audio to your top.

628
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,840

Summer time.

638
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
I was young.

639
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,840
I'm talking about the good times.

640
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Just doing it.

641
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Was all we ever cared about.

642
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,840
We had it all.

643
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,840
I'm talking about the good times.

644
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Drinking all day.

645
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
Drinking all night.

646
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Dance by the fire light.

647
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Come on.

648
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Because you are the hot air sound.

649
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,840
You know that you are the hot air sound.

650
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
You know that you are the hot air sound.

651
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
You know that you are the hot air sound.

652
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Summer time.

653
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:30,840
You know that you are the hot air sound.

654
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,840
I'm talking about the simple times.

655
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Hey, answer the call.

656
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
No right, no wrong.

657
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Read me the lies from the all they were told.

658
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Make our way up to Prosper's mind.

659
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,840
I'm talking about the good times.

660
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
No reason to fight.

661
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Cause friendly is tied.

662
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,840
And everything is alright.

663
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Make our way up to Prosper's mind.

664
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,840

I've been thinking about you now.

668
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Sit, sit, call, I've been down.

669
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I used to call, sit, shoot, and jump.

670
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,840
You're my summer time.

671
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:48,840

You know that you are the hot air sound.

674
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,840
I'm talking about the good times.

675
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,940
You don't go how much

676
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,760
so much

677
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I'll talk to another 5th minute member

678
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,100
ah it's perfect for a day like today

679
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,380

oh yeah, 6 weeks, September 3rd

683
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:44,140
And so that really puts me squarely in the middle of people who are 80's guys, I really love that kind of production

684
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:49,140
You know get a little stop gap there in the beginning and the reverse stuff. I dig it these guys have got it together

685
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:56,140
Really do like it. This is your daily source code in lieu of the hit test today. It's time once again for a hit test of a different nature

686
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Backtracks podcast

687
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,140
So you think you know your hits backwards towards

688
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
Yeah, right

689
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:12,140
You're listening to the backtracks podcast exclusively on the daily source code with Adam Curry. You know hey Adam

690
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,140
Hey, how you know what if you change this?

691
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,140
Oh, I don't like changes. So let's get right into this week's quiz. Okay. Are you ready Adam?

692
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,140
Sure. I'm cranking out.

693
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,140
You guys ready? Okay. Here we go.

694
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Number one

695
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
Yeah

696
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Right

697
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:40,140
It's a song Martha Quinn played for a month when she broke up with a boyfriend. That's missing you

698
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,140
Time's up. Number two

699
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,140
Sorry, no clue

700
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,140
Time's up. Number three

701
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,140
Oh, yeah, I know this

702
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,140
This is the same beat forwards and backwards past the Dutch team musical youth

703
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
Time's up

704
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Time's up. Okay. Here are the answers. Number one

705
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
That's right. It's missing you

706
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,140
And here's number two

707
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,140
