1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Delta's Yeracharly 2-2-9er.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,500
You're DJ.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
I you don't make fun of you!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We don't need no sticky drinks.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Fantastic.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It is Friday.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's August 26, 2005.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello everybody.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How you doing?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Today is your daily source code.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We did another full week.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll show you every single day.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, let me just call the newspapers.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let them know that that's happened.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Another beautiful day.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For a change here outside the Curry Cottage.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And killed for the United Kingdom.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The sun is shining.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's about 75 degrees.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And visibility.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Visibility is more than 10 miles.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So it's a beautiful day for flying, which I won't be doing.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because we got plenty of stuff to do today.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Time now is 145.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And I'm behind.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, by the way, it's no longer the podcast complex.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I was sent an email that with a much better name.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The curry console.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's what it is.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And yes, indeed.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It doesn't fit in with the furniture.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And that doesn't.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Maybe we need to put some wood and twirly bits on.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So it can go with the Louis Couture's desk.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So nice to see though.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Everyone's amazed at Patricia.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let me have this thing up in the office.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, of course.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is how I make a living.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But yeah, it won't be too long before.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She either wants to repaint it or wants to put curly wood bits on it.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Maybe we should go find some of those curly wood bits.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
For example, I'm pretty important for action.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She's going to take it.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I have not even taken my shower yet.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm standing here in my house coat with my eggs on.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You know, I should take a picture of this.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Today, I am in the perfect outfit for podcasting.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is our office.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And also my hair is perfect for podcasting today.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because you can't see it.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's kicking off with a great Friday mashup DJ Errorman.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I bring you scissors sisters.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The Beatles, George Michael, and Arita Franklin in no one takes your freedom.

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mashed up on the source code.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
When you grow up, leave like a good boy out of.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In your mama, days are shining for a better son.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Something different.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, the girls are seeing the like you.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because your handsome, like to talk in the pool out of fun.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But now your girl is going to miss an end.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How's it got in them deep in?

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The folks are wondering about the wedding.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They won't listen to a word you said.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We're going to take your mama out on that year.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're showing what it's all about.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We're going to jack the phone.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Some cheap champagne.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're letting the good times all roll out.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We're going to sing a low, no matter what.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because it doesn't mind if the new world is.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a different man to make a good.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Your day breaks.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Your mind makes.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You find that all I want is a kind of thing wrong.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When she no longer needs you.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She wakes up.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She makes up.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
She takes a time and doesn't feel she has to know.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She no longer needs you.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And then her eyes, you see nothing.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No sight of love beyond tears.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Cry for no one.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I love that you would have lasted years.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You will.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You will.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey, I'm a man.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You will.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You will.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You will.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You will.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You will.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You will.

99
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,000
I will.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,020
I will.

101
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,000
Do it.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,320
I will.

103
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,000
Do it.

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,140
I will.

105
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,000
Then make a good.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a happy thing.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It can stay.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If it's a calm.

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Gosh.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Maybe you're a poor man.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You want her.

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You need her.

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And yet you don't believe her.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
When she says her beloved dead.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No thing to need you.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And then her eyes, you see nothing.

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,700
I love beyond the tears, cry for no one

118
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,500
I love that shirt of last years

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,500
I'm always down

120
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I'm always down

121
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
I can't stand it, I'm always down

122
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I can't stand it, I'm always down

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm always down, I'm always down

124
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,500
I'm always down

125
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm always down

126
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I can't stand it, I'm always down

127
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm always down

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm always down

129
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm always down

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't stand it, I'm always down

131
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,000
I can't stand it, I'm always down

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm always down

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm always down

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, José that, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah,

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:28,400
I don't know what he's on because he didn't know where I was doing it but he better start

138
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,000
to share it, but it also matches no one takes your freedom, it's his assistant's Beatles,

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
George Michael and Rita Franklin.

140
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,720
On the daily source code for Friday, August 26th, 2005, thank you all so much for commenting

141
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,600
on the Curry console.

142
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,320
For those of you who are wondering if that was a CB radio that I have set up in the

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,720
booth here, no, that's not a CB.

144
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,320
Although I used to be a huge CB radio fanatic, I mean big time I was on the single side

145
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
band.

146
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:06,040
I was sniping diodes to create an extra 120 channels, I had the halfway of GPA and Tana, I had

147
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
all of that stuff.

148
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:15,680
No, that's the TLA 5052 stereo valve processor, which is basically key to a part of the

149
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
sound, which also a lot of you commented on, yeah, it's got, I've got the big gehonus sound

150
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,320
now, which I think I posted that on my weblog, you can see where PW Fenton was comparing

151
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,400
oscilloscope readouts of my voice versus his voice, saying, you know, the same, making

152
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,040
the same noise, and really what does it all, it's all electronics, I don't really sound

153
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,920
like this in real life, you come up to me, you'd be like, who's this curly boy talking?

154
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,040
By the way, I've had some email back and forth with the adub from mashuptown.com, about

155
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,600
legal ways to distribute mashups and also get the mashup artists themselves paid for

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,680
their work, as well as the artists whose music is used, and he has some pretty novel

157
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,680
ideas, certainly for a distribution of it, and I guess the real question that we have

158
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,360
then is how much you're willing to pay for a great mashup that you could own and play

159
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,800
in perpetuity, play for your friends, the problem still is, you know, how do we get this

160
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,560
to be legal on podcast, you know, that's the part that I'd, that I'd really really like

161
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,280
to figure out, at the end of the day, if we can, I mean, anything you play is going to

162
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,840
be subject, I guess, to ask at BMI rules, now that's not all that hard to, to get those

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,640
payments going, but still it comes down to the record companies, they're going to want

164
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,280
their piece, and if you use 15 different pieces of a, of a 15 different song snippets

165
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,120
in a mashup, you're going to run into a huge administrative task, but there are some

166
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,200
other ways, and we could, we could actually do a mashup show as long as we had it protected.

167
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,560
So I'm, I'm just think about a whole bunch of different ways and different things that

168
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,880
I love having MP3s just out there and anyone being able to download the show and listen

169
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,200
to it, but when it comes to copyright and material, we're going to have to figure some

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,120
stuff out pretty soon, because this is just way too much fun, you know, someone's going

171
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,560
to spoil this mashup fun soon enough.

172
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,880
I need a bar stool for this complex, yes, and I, you know, I love standing up while

173
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,720
working while doing, you know, emailing or talking on Skype, I just like standing a lot.

174
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,280
Unless they was the first full day with the laptop on the console, on the curry console,

175
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,880
had to got the Skype machine up on the top, and there, my feeders, I think I have, I

176
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,600
need a place to sit once in a while, so I'm going to be on the lookout for a bar stool

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
very soon.

178
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,160
Lift the Gmail bag, got any mail from Joe Carpenter, he's the guy from a guy a girl

179
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,480
and the bottle podcast, which is tagged as an innovative wine podcast from in and around Silicon

180
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Valley.

181
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,680
And I'll put a link to that in the show notes, of course, but he wrote me an interesting

182
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
email.

183
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
As his congratulations on the founding of your newest venture, I wanted to say how appropriate

184
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,840
you brought this to Silicon Valley as Charles Harold was the first abroad cast from San

185
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,480
Jose to the world in 1912, I'm going to cite a little bit of this, I think some of

186
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,600
this came from Wikipedia.

187
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,280
Charles Harold pioneering radio was the first person to transmit radio programs of music

188
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,240
and news to a listening audience, beginning in 1909, three years before Congress's radio

189
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,320
act of 1912, which is largely still in effect, by the way, Harold broadcasts from his

190
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,760
college of engineering and wireless, located in the guard, he believed that the college

191
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:35,360
of engineering and wireless in 1909, I was located in the garden city bank building at

192
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,400
first and San Fernando, I think that's not too far from from the condo.

193
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,360
His wife's civil was the first female disjocke in the country, together they initiated

194
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,240
commercial radio advertising, a tireless experimenter, Charles Harold developed more than

195
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,480
50 radio related inventions and there's a Wikipedia entry and I'm going to put all that

196
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,420
in the show, no, it's fascinating stuff, this is how radio got started and I didn't

197
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,840
know that, I didn't know it started in San Jose and of course, it started off with

198
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,760
the Don and Drew of the Day or the guy in the girl on the bottle of the day or the

199
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,840
Keith in the girl of the day, it seems like having a guy in the girl on the radio in

200
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,480
that type of format really works, so there you go, once again we're reinventing a lot

201
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
that's already been done.

202
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,480
Hey everybody, this is Jay from the Death Podcast, if you're among the millions of Americans

209
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Nobody needs to know you're getting the latest information on how to make your financial

future better and stronger.

211
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,360
We've in place some great pod safe music because who says getting information has to be

212
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
dry and boring.

213
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,600

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,280
Finally, a show about me.

220
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,240
Well, sort of.

Take a listen.

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,640
Open your mind.

232
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,160
So I've been playing around with all kinds of online applications.

233
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,960
I used Gmail pretty much exclusively right now for anything and everything.

234
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,640
They're all of my document management because that search feature is just so incredibly

235
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
handy.

236
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,920
And even if you just think, oh man, I've got to send so and so an email, a memory sent

237
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,560
something in and you just do a search for that person's name and the email pops up within

238
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,680
seconds, which is wonderful.

239
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,240
Now I'm getting a whole bunch of these Eid Google Talk requests and I don't know.

240
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,600
First of all, this is Windows only, which is a bummer because I do like cross-platform

241
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
application.

242
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,520
So of course, web stuff works the best and this is a Windows only app as far as I understand.

243
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,960
And it's supposed to sit in the middle of a whole bunch of stuff, but my community where

244
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,000
I use my instant messaging is through Skype.

245
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm not an MSN guy, not an Am guy, although I have looked at Am recently, they have a lot

246
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,200
of really amazing, amazing features in this, the new version is very, very out there.

247
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,400
I think that's also at this point Windows only.

248
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,880
It still is the predominant operating system.

249
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:49,880
But these Google Talk requests, where I like what they did with Gmail, they're incredibly

250
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
lame.

251
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,920
I'll see if I can bring one up here because and I hate it when this happens is when they

252
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:04,240
send out an email to you automatically that has a quasi personal message in it, let me

253
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
just grab one.

254
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,400
I have a thousand at least and from people I know and respect actually, I just do a search

255
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:18,200
so I'll do Google Talk, that says what I love about Gmail, it's going to search my mail

256
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,600
and bring something up within seconds.

257
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
There we go.

258
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
So here you go.

259
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,600
CCC Chapman has invited you to try Google Talk and that says, I've been using Google

260
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,360
Talk and thought you might like to try it out.

261
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,880
We can use it to call each other for free over the internet.

262
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,200
Here's an invitation to download Google Talk, give it a try.

263
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,720
That is where the Gmail invites were great saying, so and so was sent to an invitation

264
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,400
to join Gmail.

265
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,560
This is lame.

266
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,920
This turned me off immediately, it's like, come on, first of all, I know CCC doesn't

267
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
talk like that.

268
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:57,880
Second of all, I'm going to go to the next one in the list from Noah Centanero.

269
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I've been using Google Talk and thought you might like to try it out.

270
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,440
Yeah, so that's stupid, you know, Google is good as you are at some of this stuff.

271
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,480
This one, you really, really missed the mark.

272
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,920
And I'm just not quite sure how it's going to integrate into my life.

273
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm afraid to get on it because once you hop on it, then people think you're available

274
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,640
through that and if you go away, then you start to lose messages.

275
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,720
Anyway, just thought that was interesting.

276
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,640
Google, you know, went that direction with their messaging, with their secret invite system.

277
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,000
It was good up until this.

278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,200
And just to prove how much email really sucks, I've been waiting ever since we got

279
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,080
back from vacation for a new hit test from Beyond Palette.

280
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,920
And we've exchanged a couple emails, he's working on some stuff, he's been offered some

281
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
interesting opportunity.

282
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,160
So, you know, we always have a little sidebar conversation going on.

283
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
You know, I didn't feel like I could say, hey, young, you know, he's going to send me another

284
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,480
hit test because he just doesn't want to ever recann, he's got a busy life.

285
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,640
And then yesterday he sent me an email last evening saying, you don't like the hit test anymore.

286
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,760
So we're talking about it.

287
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,040
It turns out I've had one in my inbox for, well, ever since we started our vacation.

288
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,360
So so much for the great system.

289
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,200
But of course, I was able to pull it out really quickly and, well, why don't we play

290
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
along?

291
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Oh, yes.

292
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Hey, Adam.

293
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Hey, you're on the road again.

294
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
And now you're on a vacation.

295
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Okay, so that's yarn thinking that we were still on vacation.

296
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
So apologize.

297
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Let's continue with hit test 51.

298
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Um, I also hear you're not feeling too well.

299
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
So let's hope.

300
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
I can brighten up your day with a bit of good music.

301
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
So if you're ready, we're going to start to hit test.

302
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
This is number one.

303
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
My day, yeah.

304
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Was it full force?

305
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
No, um, ready for the world.

306
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Oh, Sheila.

307
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
And this is number two.

308
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Please, John.

309
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
It's almost insulting my intelligence.

310
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Philip Bailey and Phil Collins easy lover.

311
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,200
And the final one is always number three.

312
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
That's all back to my youth.

313
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Earthwomen's fire, fantasy.

314
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
This is a good song, John.

315
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
And time's up.

316
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,200
And here we go with the answers to hit test number 51.

317
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
This is the answer number one.

318
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
It's ready for the world.

319
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
This is Oh Sheila.

320
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
That was the jam back in the day.

321
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

322
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Ready for the world.

323
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
And this is answer number two.

324
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Philip Bailey and Phil Collins.

325
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
This is easy lover.

326
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Now take me back to my final answer for today's hit test.

327
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
It's song also.

328
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
I feel like Bailey.

329
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Great song this.

330
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Philip Bailey and Phil Collins easy lover.

331
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Now take me back to my final answer for today's hit test.

332
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
It's song also.

333
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I feel like Bailey has lead singer of Earthwomen of fire.

334
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
This is fantasy.

335
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Down.

336
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Come to see me.

337
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Earthwena fire.

338
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
And fantasy has answered number three.

339
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Well, that's it for hit test number 51.

340
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I hope you're feeling better.

341
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Well, I don't know when you're going to play this hit test.

342
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I hope I'm not wrong.

343
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
And well, hopefully you're already feeling better.

344
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Okay.

345
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
It's always two addresses.

346
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Hit test the Gmail.com for feedback.

347
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
And young polette.com.

348
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
J and P-O-L-E-T.com.

349
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,200
For info about the hit test and the hit test podcast.

350
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
That hasn't been there for a long time.

351
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
But hopefully I'll be able to make one soon.

352
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Well, thank you for listening.

353
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Until next time.

354
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Bye-bye.

355
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Thank you very much.

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Young polette with the everlasting hit test.

357
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Good to have one back.

358
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
That was easy.

359
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I liked it though.

360
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
You know, after I'm done with the show today, I'm going to head over to iTunes.

361
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm going to download fantasy by Earthwena fire.

362
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Actually, I'm going to download, I'm going to download all three of those songs.

363
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Those are great.

364
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I haven't heard those in so long.

365
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I remember fantasy Earthwena fire.

366
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,200
That's when I was like 15 years old.

367
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
And then hop on the back of Buddy's motorcycle.

368
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
We go down to the next town over.

369
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
I was living in Holland south of Amsterdam.

370
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
And we actually went to the fantasy disco tech.

371
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
You know, and in Holland it was drinking is no big deal.

372
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
So therefore it's also no big deal.

373
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,200
But you know, I remember having one gilder beers at the fantasy disco tech in At Horn.

374
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
When that was like the number one hit.

375
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Oh man, what was in those days?

376
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
We had reunited, peaches and herb.

377
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Captain Teniel.

378
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Do that to me one more time.

379
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I wonder.

380
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,200
How many of you have actually purchased a track off of iTunes after you've heard it on the hit test?

381
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
If you do that, would you please let me know?

382
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Because I think that, you know, things like this items and bits like this in podcast are fantastic

383
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
way to promote back catalog.

384
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,200
And I'm sure that people, I've heard many times from mashups that someone will say,

385
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Oh, you know, I love that mashups so much when I'm bought the original.

386
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,200
So if you ever go and get anything off of iTunes after hearing something in the hit test,

387
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,200
let us know at curie.com.

388
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Another email here from Darren Helprin.

389
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I just started listening to podcasting since iTunes 4.9 introduced them to it.

390
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Has a comment about what I was saying about oil.

391
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Peak oil actually.

392
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
And this is a pretty long comment.

393
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
But in essence, I'll just give, well, I will give it the answer.

394
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,200
As soon as you know, oil is a finite resource.

395
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,200
That is, there's a fixed amount in the earth minus that which we've already used up.

396
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
There are three things of importance.

397
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
One, how much is the total amount of extractable oil?

398
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
And the planet, how much of that have we used since we first discovered oil?

399
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
And therefore, how much of it is left to extract?

400
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Two, how many barrels and total worldwide can we produce per day?

401
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,200
And three, what is the demand in barrels per day worldwide?

402
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
And then he goes into a whole bunch of background about China,

403
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
who, of course, are consuming more oil than I think anyone,

404
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:58,200
or than ever, at least, they have an incredible rapid rate of usage,

405
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
ascending rate of usage.

406
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,200
And essentially, the whole point is, is that this is supply and demand.

407
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
And here we go.

408
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
China has bought something like 80% of the world's steel production of the past three years,

409
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,200
and a rapidly trying to negotiate deals with low-peck countries to acquire oil.

410
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
The USA2 is trying to acquire as much oil as it possibly can.

411
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
This is because it's running out.

412
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,200
You can expect to see the price of oil escalate much higher than $70 per barrel.

413
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
It may hit $100 before we know it.

414
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
This may sound like a lot of doom and gloom,

415
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,200
but I invite you to read many articles that are available at from the wilderness.com,

416
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
and I'll put that in the show notes.

417
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Because I've read about this, this theory of peak oil,

418
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
and how soon we're going to run out.

419
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,200
And I have to say, I do subscribe to some of the theories in it.

420
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,200
And if you just look at supply and demand and assume that that's based on free open markets,

421
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,200
like the Chicago Exchange and wherever else oil is traded,

422
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,200
that indeed we've got some problems brewing here.

423
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
So what are we going to do about that?

424
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I personally, I for one, I am totally into bio diesel.

425
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,200
I've talked about that before, I believe, on the show.

426
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,200
I think my next car is going to be a diesel just in case,

427
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,200
because you can basically take a crap in the tank and a diesel engine will run.

428
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
But below Adam and all the DSC listeners,

429
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
this is Rob Cossill with a new artist's podcast,

430
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
come an answer from Indianapolis, Indiana.

431
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm going to be featuring new music from all over the world in various genres.

432
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
And a couple of shows out right now.

433
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,200
It'll be doing at least three or four months.

434
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
So come subscribe to RobCossill.com.

435
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,200
That's ROB, C-O-S-T-E-L-O-W dot com.

Just click the XML link on the site and I'll see you online.

437
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Thanks.

438
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Potchow.com makes no claims regarding the quality of its potchowers

439
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
or the sanity of its producers.

440
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Listen at your own risk.

441
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Another one from Brian Deamer.

442
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Welcome to the show we're glad you're with us here.

443
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm Brian Deamer.

444
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I am Peter Reos.

445
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Excellent.

446
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Fire Superman.

447
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
That colossus.

448
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
The Phantom.

449
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
We got a geek of the day.

450
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
We can be sexy bitches too.

451
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Lightning fanboy.

452
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
How did you first get in the comments?

453
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
This is Comic GeeksB.

454
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
ComicGeeksB.com.

455
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,200
It's just so entertaining.

456
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Let's get to the daily source code.

457
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
If you didn't know that, like you were scanning some radio dial and bumped into it.

458
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Got a lot of feedback on the teenager comments.

459
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Feedback from people who have teenagers.

460
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Feedback from people who have kids who will one day be teenagers.

461
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
And no feedback from teenagers actually.

462
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
But thank you very much.

463
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I think that we should do some more with that.

464
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
There's a huge community.

465
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
That is kind of everywhere.

466
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
And it's the community of parents.

467
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
That's what I like about the mommy cast.

468
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
And I was the name of that.

469
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I got it.

470
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Oh, man.

471
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
I really got to get that show.

472
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
I got to get a piece of that show for you.

473
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Hold on.

474
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Let me just look up my podcast outline here.

475
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,200
This is 101 uses for baby wipes.

476
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
That's what it is.

477
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
I've got to get.

478
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
I hope those guys will send me a promo.

479
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
We talked about it yesterday.

480
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Please make promos.

481
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
And then promos in.

482
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,200
It is by far the best way to promote your show.

483
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I think you can also put promos now on podcast.

484
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I'll leave.

485
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,200
We're going to have that capability for promos to be automatically inserted on the indie

486
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Potter.org.

487
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
And of course, promos.

488
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,200
You know, I love playing promos.

489
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
And it's easy.

490
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,200
You know, because you can really focus all of the attention of what you're trying to or what

491
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,200
you do in your regular show or podcast or program whatever you want to call it.

492
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,200
You can really focus that and get your message across in condensed form.

493
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,200
And it's a great way for exchanging promos is easy.

494
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Although it does fill up my Gmail.

495
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,200
I just went back and had to delete a couple different emails with the attachments.

496
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
You know, it's just not true.

497
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Google can't keep up with me.

498
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
You know, this infinity plus one.

499
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I see what they're doing.

500
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,200
You know, whenever you get in within like 10 megabytes of your quota,

501
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
then you start to get more.

502
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
But that goes with like one or two megs a day.

503
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,200
And interestingly enough, your quota gets set to 100% even though you still may have five megs left.

504
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,200
So then you can't effectively send email have to go in and delete something.

505
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,200
And lots of people said, well, why don't you just open up another Gmail account and forward the email from that.

506
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
I'll tell you why I don't want to do that.

507
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,200
The main reason is I want to keep, you know, just that search function, all in one place is fantastic.

508
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
That's the whole concept of Gmail.

509
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,200
But also it uses JavaScript and I guess it's Ajax maybe.

510
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:41,200
That's, is that with the new HTML programming language that everyone, you know, that flicker uses and all these other great sites that have incredible functionality right in the browser.

511
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,200
I think that Gmail uses that for.

512
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,200
How was that?

513
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Okay, in 15 minutes, I have to call my banker from almost to give her an update.

514
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,200
What was I saying? Oh, it uses, so Ajax or JavaScript or whatever it is.

515
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,200
To remember the email addresses that you've typed in or people you've sent an email to or responded to.

516
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,200
And that is that really makes that interface fly.

517
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,200
You know, not having to click on anything to figure out what someone's email address is,

518
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,200
but just start typing in a piece of a name and then it works and I love that so much.

519
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
I don't know how I got to the Gmail thing again.

520
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,200
One last bit of feedback here from Peter.

521
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Yes, I was talking about how if you look at the GPS track that I flew when we went to Rotterdam.

522
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,200
You see when the plane was actually parked.

523
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,200
The GPS registered it as if we were running across the tarmac and running through the building.

524
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
It looked like we were really going berserk.

525
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:56,200
And as I thought, this is, well, what I said is I thought it was probably because of the overcast skies that the GPS couldn't get a handle.

526
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Couldn't get a good fix.

527
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Peter has a different explanation.

528
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Because most folks don't know it, but the GPS system is accurate to within a few inches.

529
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
That's why those smart bombs work.

530
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Okay, here's the part they don't know.

531
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
The US government, of course, doesn't want to share that technology with someone who might want to use it.

532
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Against the US.

533
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,200
So they build in a certain amount of pseudo random inaccuracy that they alone know how to decode and defeat.

534
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Manufacturers of GPS of consumer GPS units have become quite skilled at looking at a whole bunch of satellites at once and sort of averaging the built in errors out.

535
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Hence we enjoy accuracy to within around 50 feet or so.

536
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,200
But in reality, three satellites could actually get you accuracy measurable to within inches.

537
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
So every time you hear about a new advancement in consumer GPS units,

538
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,200
it's an advancement in defeating the US government's built in on purpose errors.

539
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,200
If they turn their scrambles off, our GPS units would probably work better than theirs.

540
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Interesting.

541
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
I had heard this.

542
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,200
And you know, there is a way in aviation GPS.

543
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
I know what they do in the states.

544
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,200
I don't know if they, and I think the UK as well, you can synchronize to a radio station that is sending out a signal.

545
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Some kind of pilot tone, and you can use that to get accurate results on the GPS.

546
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Again, I'm not sure how accurate those results are, but it does make sense.

547
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,200
And I have heard this story before about messing up the GPS signal on purpose.

548
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:23,200
So I guess that the Bluetooth GPS that I have basically, you know, just does a reasonably good job if you're moving.

549
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,200
But if you're stationary, then it starts to have problems.

550
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
And it's particularly with an overcast sky.

551
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
It has problems trying to really figure out where you are.

552
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,200
So that does sound like a very feasible answer.

553
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Damn, what are we at?

554
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Not 30 minutes?

555
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
You know, 33 minutes.

556
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
We should wrap this up.

557
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
I was listening as usual every morning.

558
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,200
I go through my email, and I usually pass by the podcast music network to check out what the top pod plays are.

559
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,200
You know, what people are listening to, what other shows are playing.

560
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
And we're coming up with more functionality.

561
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
By the way, the store will be opening very soon.

562
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
And also, we're going to have forums.

563
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,200
So you can comment on on the artist's pages or on the podcast or pages.

564
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
So we can get some some real good feedback flowing through the site.

565
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,200
And I was playing this next song by Grittle, which is one of the top plays.

566
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
And Patricia walked in and she said,

567
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
God damn, I quote,

568
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
God damn, this is good, she said.

569
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
I think you're like a two.

570
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
It's a little bit of Beatles influence there.

571
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,200
I saw you sleeping in your house.

572
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

573
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,200
And I saw you sleeping in your house.

574
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

575
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,200
And I saw you sleeping in your house.

576
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

577
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

578
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

579
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

580
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

581
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

582
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

583
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

584
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

585
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

586
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

587
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

588
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

589
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

590
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

591
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

592
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

593
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
and I can't think of nothing worse.

594
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

595
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
and I can't think of nothing worse.

596
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

597
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

598
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
But I can't think of nothing worse.

599
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

600
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

601
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
And I can't think of nothing worse.

602
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,200
and I can't think of nothing worse.

603
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:44,160
You are the fairest of the mall, griddle, I'm reading it and had it all in there.

604
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,840
I think Patricia is absolutely right.

605
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,000
She said, is that a new band that said, no, baby, this is what we call pot-safe music.

606
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Haven't you heard about it?

607
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
All the kids are doing it.

608
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's really cool.

609
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You should check it out.

610
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
She's surfing over already.

611
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,080
And that is it for today's Daily Source Code.

612
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,520
Going into a weekend where I'll be plenty busy.

613
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,120
We've got lots of pot-show stuff going on, I remember I'm on the dual-life cycle right now.

614
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,720
We start a whole new day around 4 in the afternoon.

615
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:18,360
So I'm not complaining about it.

616
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,160
If I haven't mentioned this before, let me say it again, I love doing this stuff.

617
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,680
This is this the dream or what?

618
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:35,640
Hang out, get up, don't even shave, just crawl behind the console, do a little show, always want

619
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,840
to work with computers and combine it all the way.

620
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,720
And finally got my wish, so dig in it.

621
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Hey, send me your promo.

622
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,280
So I can play them on the show, we can get them on the serious satellite radio, and soon

623
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,840
we can also start promoting those on the podshow.com homepage, submit at podshow.com for all

624
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,440
your promos.

625
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,920
And feedback, of course, is always welcome out of Maccurry.com.

626
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,560
Please do not attach an MP3, stick it up on a server somewhere.

627
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:12,480
Give it a real name, put some real MP3 tags in there, so that it works in my player,

628
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,280
and I know what the hell is going on, I don't have a grip notes everywhere, and also

629
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:23,160
is really handy for moving it through our system, our promotions engine, if you will.

630
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:32,080
www.curry.com is my weblog, for comments.

631
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:37,400
Of course, daily source code.com for the podcast feed, I'll be back on Monday, unless

632
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,920
Patricia and I do something over the weekend, it's Christina's birthday on Saturday, she

633
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,040
turns 15, so we'll be having a party, talk to you on everybody, bye-bye.
