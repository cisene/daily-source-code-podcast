00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Your daily source code from Monday may 16th 2005.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since radio is invented.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's the start of a new week on the source code.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Adam Curry coming to you from Curry Cottage in lovely gilford.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A nice suburb of London in United Kingdom.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Look out at the window not too nice today.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The weekend was just stellar though.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Unbelievable.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
They predicted wind and cloudy skies.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I guess it came one day late.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It doesn't happen often but it's good enough.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I had the time to just break away from all things podcasting computer.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Anything going on in the office, basically.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or the bedroom that we call an office.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or that we sometimes call a studio.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Patricia came back Saturday.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wind commander William picked her up in Rotterdam.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And flew her over in the Sessner 182.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Which is the plane I've been training on.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Which I will be acquiring once I have my license and I've been deemed safe enough to make the crossing.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Which could last half a year, nine months, ten months, man.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's tough stuff.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It really has nothing at all to do with helicopter flying.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll tell you that it's just something completely different.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But I am getting a little bit more of the hang of it now.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
At least I'm making work controlled landings.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And I'm understanding the navigation is so much better.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Because on helicopters, you know what I mean.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Look out the window.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Going slow enough to see where you're going.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you want to turn left, right go up or down.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's relatively simple.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You can slow down to a stop and mid-air.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Just not that way with airplanes.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So it's nice.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We flew around to different airfields here in the neighborhood.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I was starting, of course, from my home-based pharaohs.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And then Booget, I'll see you on Saturday after he brought Patricia in.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We went to...

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What was it?

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
West London Aeroclob.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's New Barcher.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And then Sunday we went to Goodwood, which is also just another flying club.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And it's unbelievable.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The culture of flying in this country is just so fantastic.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I mean, you land there on Saturday or Sunday.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And it's like you walk into a Biggles novel.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You know, if you know the Biggles novels, I'll put a link to something about Biggles in the show notes for today's podcast.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But wow.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And there's guys all decked out and there's businessmen who are clearly on their weekend off just flying around.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And everyone's having a good time.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And there's like 100 people in the bar cafe.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And just, you know, good time, food, coffee, drinks.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Really, really nice culture.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And normally, certainly in the Netherlands, if you come in, certainly if you come in from outside the country and say, hey, you know, it's Saturday or Sunday.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We'd like to do some training here on your airfield.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And of course, you have to pay for the touching goes and your overland approaches and all that.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But most of them will say, well, you know, sorry, this is for our club members.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And we just don't have time for you.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But everyone was really courteous and they let us do as many touches touching goes that we needed.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And it was just great.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It was really a fun feeling.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Great to be away from anything else that was going on.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You know, just, what when you're flying this, you can basically, at least I can only think about one thing.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's flying because you get distracted for three seconds.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And, you know, that could be the difference of 300 feet or it could be the difference between on track or off track or forgetting something.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's important that could be a real day record. So it was, it was nice.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I find that extremely relaxing, even though I, you know, it's hard work.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You get really tired after a couple of days of training.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Excuse me.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It was nice said that Patricia enjoyed her flight from Rotterdam to, to the airport here.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Because I was a little worried that she wouldn't like the, the small single-engine aircraft vibe.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This isn't really the smallest Cessna, by the way.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You know, you have the two-seater, the 152, then you have the four-seater, the 172.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And this is the 182 with retractable gear.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I know I've talked about it a million times, but I can't get enough of it.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's my, my real hobby.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And it's bigger. It's like a cab.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's like a taxi cab that flies.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But she had a great time. She loved it.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There was a lot of turbulence on Saturday.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I didn't mind that at all.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
William took her up to 3,000 feet and brought her straight in for 3,000 feet all the way.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And it was good.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So that is a win in my book, which means that once I am actually approved to fly by myself,

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and we can do some more that she'll go with me, and we'll have some fun together,

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and we can go exploring some really, really looking forward to that.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If your name is Dave Weiner, you may want to pay attention to this podcast.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Some of it pertains to you.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But not this first song.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is a mashup.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
DJ Tripstrung this one together.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We will rock Beverly Hills.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Q-reaser.

101

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But you don't want to make a big life.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Pain in the street.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Gonna be a big mashup.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You got mud on your face.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You big disgrace.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Gifting your trend all over the place.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If you feel we will rock you.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000

278
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,000
DJ Tripputed together. I'm just looking over to the other computer to the screen there. It was a

279
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,840
Weezer Beverly Hills Queens. We will rock you Joan Jet. I love rock and roll and Leonard Skinner's

280
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,320
Sweet Home Alabama and Link in the show notes is or Link to that is and all the information about

281
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,640
that mashup you can find in the show notes at dailysourceco.com or at curry.com. A lot of questions

282
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,600
always come in. Usually whenever there's a new article that appears about podcasting people

283
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,680
want to know what kind of equipment I use and what do I use for sound seeing tours. By the way,

284
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:25,000
I've noticed that I guess it's the way I pronounce sound seeing tours that it often comes across

285
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,080
as sound seen tours. So it took me about six or eight weeks before I figured out what are these

286
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,720
people talking about sound seen? What's the sound seen? It's like a sound scape or but it's just

287
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,440
misunderstanding the pronunciation sound seeing tour and it's actually a website which I have

288
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,240
to update or at RSS feed. A podcast feed for different sound seeing tours. It's sound seeing

289
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,000
tours.com. No wonder people haven't been able to find it. But many of the questions that come in

290
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,920
on email after an article about podcasting appears are similar to this one which came in an

291
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,520
audio which I like. So let's answer them right now. This is Tyler Collins from What's Really Going

292
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:17,800
On podcast. I have a question. Number one, what is the version of your eye river?

293
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,400
Okay. Oh yeah. Sorry that's the this is newfangled megaseg. The way it stops and starts.

294
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:32,680
It's the IFP 799. I believe in Europe it's actually the 899 and I don't know if that's

295
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,800
any difference in the models but the model number seems to be 899 in Europe 799 in the states.

296
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,520
What I like about the eye river is you know it's a device that you can create something on and you can

297
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,680
listen to something on it and it works on the same device and you can plug it on a microphone

298
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,120
or you can switch the in jack to a line in. So it really has all the capabilities you need built

299
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,880
into one little box and man the battery one double a alkaline battery lasts for fucking ever.

300
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,800
So I think just on battery charge alone it's a great little device. As a built in radio you're

301
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,720
couldn't record from the radio if you want although I'd never have I think I've only listened to the

302
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,840
radio once or twice on this thing but it's a great great little great little gadget let's see

303
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,520
what's next question is your talk what's going on. You use whenever you do a portable podcast

304
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:33,960
and number two what version of cast blaster or something comparable would you suggest for a Mac

305
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:42,600
user. I am currently using digital performer 4.5 I am a music producer and I make that work for me but

306
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,560
it doesn't work on a broadcast type level to where I can throw in sweepers and promos and so forth.

307
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,640
I was just wondering about that hope you're doing well. I enjoy your show and keep up the great

308
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,200
work man. All right Todd thank you very much. Well I use cast blaster a lot obviously but that's only

309
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,920
for the windows platform. One of my Mac and I am a Mac guy being my heart and my soul. I right

310
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,520
currently I'm using something called Megaseg and I'll put another link in the show notes to that

311
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,240
which may be a little bit of overkill for what most people are looking for if you're looking for

312
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,840
a podcast we can line stuff up and play list. Basically a playlist where you can stop the playlist

313
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,120
the midstream or stop automatically I guess the automatic part is what I use it for. You can insert

314
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,720
a break and say okay stop here and I'm going to talk here and then when you want to go you just hit

315
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,360
a button and it plays the next element. I started off using actually just quick time players just opening

316
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,960
up each element that I wanted to play in the podcast in a quick time player and then just basically

317
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,960
highlighting the player that was next and then hitting the space bar which will make it play.

318
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,640
That's a real easy way but of course for recording purposes it's a little bit tougher. I have

319
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:58,200
been using audio hijack pro their new version recently for recording because they now offer a

320
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:07,240
capability to record the entire sound as produced on your Mac which really makes your Mac one big

321
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,520
mixer and of course each individual application that you open so let's say it's a quick time or

322
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,520
maybe it's a real real player or it could be a media player it could be a whole bunch of different

323
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,480
things or Skype it doesn't matter what it is as long as you can hear it through the headphones

324
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,520
it'll record so that I really like and you can also mix in different applications if you just want

325
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,640
to hijack the microphone for instance so audio hijack pro is getting there but it certainly doesn't

326
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,400
the ease of use that I'd be looking for in an application that has the interface of something like

327
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,600
a cast blaster so nothing really for the Mac yet we're all kind of just string and stuff together

328
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,400
what I find doesn't work for me definitely doesn't work as garage band that doesn't work for me

329
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,000
what else about I think I've tried just about everything so yeah as I said currently I'm on mega

330
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,160
sagging that's that's working okay for me and all this computer talk makes me want to roll out some

331
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,440
pot-safe tunes from Ed Wright well it's bound to ruin my life

332
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
computer computer

333
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,440
well it's bound to ruin my life

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:36,280
well it hypnotizes my children and it's bound to steal my life

335
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,280
she spends more time in the chat room

336
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:57,800
she's meant more time in the chat room

337
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,200
that she ever do with me

338
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:12,360
I think I'm getting some electronic hell

339
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
and I don't really need

340
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,960
she got so many friends

341
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,400
I never seen me vote

342
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,360
she got so many friends

343
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,600
I have never seen me vote

344
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,040
out of the morning late in the evening

345
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
sitting there that damn people

346
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:05,880
well I'm going to make me a website

347
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,280
one that looks real slick

348
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm going to make me a website

349
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,000
it is website

350
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,720
one that looks real slick

351
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,680
well it's lost all to me

352
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:52,680
maybe is that well due to the trick

353
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Oh no.

354
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
You got me out.

355
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
You got pictures.

356
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
You got pictures of your mail.

357
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,680
I'm gonna pack up all my files.

358
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,680
You're gonna move around down the night.

359
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,680
I'm gonna pack up all my files.

360
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,680
You're gonna move around down the night.

361
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm gonna be a real fast model.

362
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Take my data all the time.

363
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Come here, come here.

364
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Take it my wife.

365
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Oh, maybe it's taking you away from your wife.

366
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Ed Wright, computer computer.

367
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Podsafe music on the daily source code.

368
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,680
If you don't know what Podsafe music is,

369
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I'll reiterate the whole concept.

370
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,680
We can't play licensed music on podcasts,

371
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,680
whether that's just a legal issue that we have to get over,

372
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
or if it's a financial issue or whatever it is,

373
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
we just can't legally at this moment.

374
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,680
So what happened is we have lots of,

375
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I mean, lots, tens, hundreds of thousands of people

376
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
creating songs on the computers,

377
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
on the computer computers,

378
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,680
and making it available for podcasters to play in their podcasters

379
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
as long as you point them back to the website.

380
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,680
So of course, the link to Ed Wright's computer computer

381
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
will be in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

382
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
Found on the great podcasters,

383
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,680
you know, in the broadcasting that we talk about formats

384
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,680
and formats are very different from,

385
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
well, then again, maybe not,

386
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
but in computing and computer engineering,

387
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
you always talk about formats.

388
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
For instance, let's see,

389
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
you have RSS is a format.

390
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
It's the way that information is formatted,

391
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
so that you can easily understand it.

392
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
A format and broadcasting,

393
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
the simplest way to explain it would be,

394
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
for instance, a top 40 radio station,

395
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
looks at a format over each hour,

396
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,680
and then day parts,

397
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
and then over 24 hour period,

398
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,680
to really put a sequence of songs

399
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,680
into an hour that will hold the audience the longest,

400
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
I guess, is the only reason,

401
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
and give you the most listening pleasure,

402
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
of course, formats have gotten really tight,

403
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
as we say in the business over the years

404
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
and have become a little bit boring.

405
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
But a typical top 44 mat may be

406
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,680
where the hour starts off with a big number one smash hit,

407
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
and then it's followed by what we call recurrent,

408
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
so that may be something from maybe 10 years ago,

409
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
followed by something that's up and coming,

410
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,680
followed by something that's in the bottom half of the top 40,

411
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
followed by a brand new song, so that's a format.

412
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
That's how you fill up an hour.

413
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
In podcasting, we're seeing formats emerge as well,

414
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
the hit test that young Paulette does,

415
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
and a young won't be able to do a hit test every single day,

416
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
if at all for the next coming weeks,

417
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,680
because he's in rehabilitation for

418
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
some medical stuff he's going through,

419
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
a young Paulette dot NL,

420
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
as we can find out all about that,

421
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
and listen to the hit test podcast.

422
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,680
But the format of the show

423
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
is of the little snippet that he sends into me,

424
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
is a good one,

425
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
it's three segments of songs that he thinks I'll know,

426
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
and of course he gives me little snippet of the song,

427
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
and then replays this snippet of the song,

428
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
and then gives me a couple seconds

429
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,680
of thinking time to come up with the answer,

430
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
and then at the end he gives me the answers and plays

431
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
on a longer pieces of the songs.

432
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
That format has now been copied,

433
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
which is not a bad thing,

434
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
is great, into a podcast called

435
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
voices from the vault.

436
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Jerry Orkin does this,

437
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
and let's play along with

438
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,680
the show from the sixth of May.

439
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:10,680
I love it.

440
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Good day everyone,

441
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
welcome to the second episode of Voices from the Vault.

442
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
I've checked the stats from our website,

443
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
and it looks like about 60 people

444
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
downloaded the first episode of the podcast,

445
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,680
so I'd like to thank everyone of you for adding me,

446
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,680
to your podcast downloader.

447
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
I've also had some very supportive feedback too,

448
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
so thank you for that.

449
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
I think I'll be incorporating some suggestions

450
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,680
that have been made into future episodes.

451
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I'm going to try and do two voices

452
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
from the Vault podcast every week,

453
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
so stay tuned for some challenging listening

454
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,680
in the weeks and months to come.

455
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Today I'll be playing other voices

456
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
of three famous screen actors,

457
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,680
your job is to guess who they are before I give you the answers.

458
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Up in your ears, and we'll begin

459
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,680
with the first of today's voices from the Vault.

460
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Try to do as your high-the-met...

461
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
if the... a message is a great thing.

462
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
It's a great thing you must never tell anybody

463
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
that there is a message at all.

464
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
Ever.

465
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Did you get it?

466
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Try to do as your high-the-met... if the... a message is a great thing.

467
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,680
It's a great thing you must never tell anybody that there is a message at all.

468
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Ever.

469
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
I've already heard this show once,

470
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
so I'll just do the answers I had when I heard the first time.

471
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
The first one...

472
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
Okay, this one I heard was...

473
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
I didn't know.

474
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
I didn't know.

475
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
This is from the Vault.

476
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Sorry, dear.

477
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
If this is the day,

478
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,680
my emotional apparatus is...

479
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
I know.

480
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
I was plugged up with something.

481
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,680
I'm convention pushing and passion pumping.

482
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
It's not coming easy for me.

483
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,680
If this is the day, my emotional apparatus

484
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,680
is plugged up with something.

485
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I'm convention pushing and passion pumping.

486
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,680
It's not coming easy for me.

487
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
So the first time I heard this,

488
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
I thought it was Marlon Brando,

489
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,680
but I knew it was the other guy who crashed in his Porsche.

490
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
I couldn't come with a name.

491
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Pretty hard one.

492
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
This one should be a bit easier.

493
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Here it comes.

494
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Voice from the Vault.

495
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Number three.

496
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
I still go back to my Prince now living Greenwich.

497
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
And I still go back there and take a walk in everything

498
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
still seems the same.

499
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Which I think is the great beauty of this country

500
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,680
is that even though we're still culturally...

501
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,680
We've also managed to maintain a lot of our...

502
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,680
the things that make this country very special.

503
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,680
I still go back to my Prince now living Greenwich.

504
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,680
And I still go back there and take a walk in everything

505
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
still seems the same.

506
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Which I think is the great beauty of this country

507
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
is that even though...

508
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
See, I thought this one was pretty easy when I heard it.

509
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
I've heard off the bat.

510
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
I heard the accent.

511
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
I know it was in the cold kidmas.

512
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,680
I didn't know the first two, but I certainly had this last.

513
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Special.

514
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
The cold kidman.

515
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
The cold kidman.

516
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Right now it's time for the answers.

517
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,680
The first of today's voices from the Vault.

518
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Screenwriter, director, director, director.

519
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Mel Brooks.

520
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Ah, the thousand year old man.

521
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
A thousand year old man.

522
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
A thousand year old man.

523
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
A message is a great thing.

524
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
It's a great thing.

525
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
You mustn't ever tell anybody that there is a message.

526
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
It'll ever.

527
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
The second voice from the Vault.

528
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Taken from the interview on the set of the movie

529
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Rebel without a cause.

530
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
James Steeze.

531
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
I was close.

532
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
This is the day.

533
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,680
My emotional apparatus is...

534
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
I was plugged up or something.

535
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm convention pushing and passion pumping.

536
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
It's not coming easy for me.

537
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
And the final voice from the Vault.

538
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
That very modern movie star.

539
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Nicole Kittman.

540
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,680
I still go back to my prince now live in Greenwich.

541
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,680
And I still go back there and take a walk in everything still seems the same.

542
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Which I think is the great beauty of this country is that even though we're still culturally

543
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:56,680
right on top of it, we're also managed to maintain a lot of our things that make this country very special.

544
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Send feedback to feedback at voices from the Vault.com.

546
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Until next time.

547
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Goodbye from voices from the Vault.

548
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Jerry Orkin with voices from the Vault.

549
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Awesome.

550
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Awesome podcast.

551
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,680
The highly interactive voice really works for me.

552
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
From the Vault.

553
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Because the minute you're sitting there looking at your MP3 player and yelling at it, thinking

554
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,680
you have the answer, I call that the epitome of interactivity.

555
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Absolutely fantastic.

556
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Love that format.

557
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,680
The way it's started to morph into something new, fantastic.

558
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Of course, a pointer to that podcast in the show notes as well for today.

559
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,680
So last Friday I was wrapping up the week.

560
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
It had been a real long week for me.

561
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Patricia was out of town.

562
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,680
So I was doing double duty as Mr. Mom.

563
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,680
And then, do I miss all the stuff she does?

564
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Taking care of Christina, of course.

565
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
And I was in the kitchen cooking.

566
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
I had the crap top with me.

567
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
That's my laptop.

568
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
The tablet.

569
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
The craplet.

570
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
There you go.

571
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,680
And I used that for Skype.

572
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,680
And I can connect the iTunes on that to the iTunes up stairs in the office.

573
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
So I can just listen to whatever's coming in.

574
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,680
So I basically have one place where my podcasts are updated through my iPodder.

575
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,680
And I can just stream that to any other computer I want to.

576
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
So I only have to have it in one spot.

577
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
Works really well.

578
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,680
And I'm subscribed to Dave Winner's Morning Coffee Notes.

579
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,680
And really religiously read scripting.com.

580
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,680
And you can imagine how really delighted I was when I heard the end of his Friday podcast

581
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
and he said the following.

582
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
My name is Dave Winner.

583
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
It's Friday the 13th.

584
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:55,680
One more thing to call out to Adam Curry who's got his pod show on serious is Dave viewing right now as we speak.

585
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
I wish I could listen to it.

586
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,680
I don't have a serious satellite radio, but I'm going to be listening to the, you know,

587
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
where everybody has to say about it.

588
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Good luck to you Adam.

589
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Knock him dead.

590
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Break a leg.

591
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
You know, all of us that shit.

592
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,680
And I don't know.

593
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Boy.

594
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Okay, everybody.

595
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
See you all later.

596
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Bye.

597
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
This is Dave.

598
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
So you can imagine I was like really elated.

599
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,680
I was so, I mean, that was such a nice thing for him to do.

600
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Particularly because he's starting on Friday.

601
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:33,680
I knew that he was going to start the first podcast on KU radio in San Francisco on Monday.

602
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
And so I was like, oh man, that's really cool.

603
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,680
I got to make sure I say something back in my podcast.

604
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
And it really had been a tough week.

605
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,680
It worked very hard on putting the first four hours of serious together.

606
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
And I knew how to work over the weekend.

607
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Do some more work for the coming week.

608
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
So it was nice.

609
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
It was just one of those things like, wow, man.

610
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
That's, that's an olive branch for sure.

611
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,680
And then over the weekend, a wired article came out written by Jenny Jardin from,

612
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
was just a lot of things.

613
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Actually, it was a, a written interview from something we did on a,

614
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,680
her NPR piece.

615
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,680
She does a, I guess, a technology report on NPR.

616
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
So we had a couple of chats.

617
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Very, very nice, by the way, I had never met her only,

618
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
I've been reading, boring, boring.

619
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,680
So it was kind of nice to get a voice to the, to the face.

620
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
And of course, I'm trying to get her to start a podcast.

621
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
I think she'd be perfect for one.

622
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,680
And the article, it was a very flattering article.

623
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
There was about me.

624
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
What did she call it?

625
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,680
She called it to communicate with the pod father or something like that.

626
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,680
And Dave just went off on this.

627
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:43,680
He went off on me in such an incredibly hurtful manner on scripting.com.

628
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,680
He wrote, he wrote about this, this article.

629
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,680
And then, you know, he calls me horrible things.

630
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,680
And I was like, whoa, this, it really, really blew me away.

631
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,680
And I'm not going to, you know, read what he wrote on scripting.com.

632
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
You can go and check that out for yourself.

633
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
And I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

634
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,680
But by coincidence, I did find a kind of a mashup montage sitting on

635
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,680
his server on this morning coffee note server that I, I don't know who made it.

636
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
But it is on his server.

637
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
So I'll, I'll share it with you.

638
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
It's, it's called the curry collage.

639
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,680
And I guess it'll give you the kind of an idea of what this article says.

640
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
It's Adam Curry.

641
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
You are a bitch.

642
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Oh, yeah.

643
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Oh, yeah.

644
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Oh, yeah.

645
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Oh, yeah.

646
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
I apologize.

647
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
I'm a dick.

648
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
So dick some respect.

649
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Wacky stuff.

650
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Oh, yeah.

651
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
Oh, yeah.

652
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Oh, yeah.

653
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Oh, yeah.

654
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Oh, yeah.

655
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,680
You know, I'm an idiot.

656
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I'm an idiot.

657
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
It's dick.

658
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
I'm an idiot.

659
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
You know, I'm an idiot.

660
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,680
You don't get so much fat.

661
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,680
I'm bad about what you're hearing that wild cherry sign.

662
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
I was like, what's that?

663
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,680
I can 70, you say 78.

664
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Something like that.

665
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Really think I give a shit.

666
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Oh, what a hell of dick.

667
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm a dick.

668
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Touch anything sniff it all.

669
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
Touch it.

670
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
Touch it.

671
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Touch it.

672
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
Touch it.

673
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Touch it.

674
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Touch it.

675
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Touch it.

676
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Touch it.

677
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Touch it.

678
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Touch it.

679
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Touch it.

680
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Touch it.

681
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Touch it.

682
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Touch it.

683
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,680
You're a bad man and you made me cry.

684
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
I hate you.

685
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
What?

686
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
You know, I'm an idiot.

687
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
He owed the key mode.

688
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
He owed the key mode.

689
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Have you been drinking?

690
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Oh, yeah.

691
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Snippin TV.

692
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Let's be a dick.

693
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Touch anything.

694
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Oh, good good.

695
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
What a dick.

696
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
That dick.

697
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:38,680
What you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard.

698
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:44,680
At no point will you even close to anything that could be considered irrational but

699
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Everyone in this room is now dumber for having left into it.

700
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,680
So that kind of sums up what Dave wrote about me and

701
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Wow, I was like how am I going to respond to this?

702
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,680
I think the best way for me to respond is to kind of let you know how I feel.

703
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,680
And then I want to talk about why I think this is happening.

704
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
And so the first, I'll play a song now.

705
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,680
The only really way I know how to express my feelings about what's going on

706
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,680
with how this craziness.

707
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Isn't it strange?

708
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:23,680
The stars don't shine no more now since you'll go.

709
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Isn't it strange that we can't look back and see

710
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,680
And just what went wrong?

711
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,680
I want to know now when we are.

712
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Should I pretend in a little thing?

713
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Yeah, I know when I want you to.

714
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Could you confess your feelings with me?

715
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Isn't it strange that you told me and won't think

716
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Suddenly it changed your mind?

717
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Isn't it strange that you'd come here for me

718
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Turn away and leave me behind.

719
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Now if he's like I'm drowning.

720
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,680
If he's like I'm drowning away without you.

721
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Could I know the feeling?

722
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Because I felt very sorry for.

723
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

724
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

725
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

726
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,680
I hope you don't like me.

727
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Isn't it strange that the world seems to know it

728
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,680
When I try and explain what's all strange

729
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:50,680
That you can be as one yet another same

730
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,680
And if he's like I'm drowning.

731
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,680
If he's like I'm drowning away without you.

732
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,680
I know the feeling.

733
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Because I felt very sorry for.

734
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,680
And if he's like I'm drowning.

735
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,680
If he's like I'm drowning.

736
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

737
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

738
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

739
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I hope you don't like me.

740
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

741
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

742
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

743
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

744
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,680
I hope you don't feel just like me.

745
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,180
I hope you're so free with just a lot of love

746
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,680
If I got home you'll feel much more together

747
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Maybe not to love it

748
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Not so happy, yeah

749
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Not so happy, yeah

750
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Not so happy, we'll go to my way

751
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Not so happy, yeah

752
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Not so happy, yeah

753
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Not so happy, yeah

754
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,680
We'll go to my way

755
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Roger from In Twine sums it up

756
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Happy on the Daily Source Code

757
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,680
So I guess, and it's really, I don't feel happy

758
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,680
That Dave was resorted to name calling, which I think is so totally unfair

759
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Because it's all about credit

760
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,680
Who created podcasting, who created this, who created that

761
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,680
What Dave accuses me of continuously is if not giving him proper credit

762
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,680
And what boggles my mind is that he would for one minute think

763
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:12,680
That when you have a publication that has editors and all kinds of people in the mix

764
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,680
And it's not a weblog that you would think that the only people

765
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Who get written incorrectly about as you Dave

766
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,680
You know, Jenny Jardin actually was also blown away by what you wrote

767
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,680
And she said that today, Monday, she would be posting

768
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,680
The rest of the interview that was cut out by her editors

769
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Where not only did I credit you but talk about all the work that you had done

770
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:48,680
But also Chris Lydon's work and many other people who contributed to podcasting as it is today

771
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Including a Denny Gregoire who came up with the name

772
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,680
It's like, you know, I didn't write the interview

773
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
And this happens all the time

774
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,680
And this is what happened in January when we were in Miami

775
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,680
This roller coaster ride with Dave is like one day

776
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
It's great and then the next second it's all the way down

777
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
And it's very, very tiring

778
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,680
And the only thing I can really grom out of all this

779
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,680
And I've seen it happen a couple of times is that you just want to be famous

780
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,680
And you are, you know, and I think you don't have to go asking for credit all the time

781
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,680
By the way, if you go to a bank and ask for credit, you never get it

782
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,680
So you know, don't expect any other large institution to give you credit

783
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Particularly not if you might have burned some bridges

784
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,680
Because, you know, sometimes you come across very crass

785
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,680
And people who hold the microphone or hold the camera

786
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Remember that shit and they may not be holding it forever

787
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,680
But, you know, don't expect them to turn around and be giving you credit

788
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,680
Which is totally within the control of the person who has the credit to give

789
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,680
Which is not me, it's the publications who are publicizing this

790
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,680
I've written all the time about the work that you've done

791
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,680
And I'm not going to go back and call every single interview

792
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,680
Or tell them that they're an idiot or that they're a dickhead

793
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
The words you used, you know, on me

794
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Because they wrote their story, it's the story they were interested in writing

795
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,680
So, it's very, very unfortunate

796
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,680
And I really can only chalk it up to the fact that you feel that you just not famous

797
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Be careful what you wish for

798
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,680
I want to be famous, I want to wear minks and sattens and pearls

799
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,680
I want to be famous more than just any old girl

800
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,680
I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

801
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,680
I want all the people to look at me

802
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,680
I want my own show on TV, I want to be that girl

803
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,680
I want to be famous, eat out at sardies, have parties, that's fine

804
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,680
I want to be famous, go to Paris on private flights

805
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,680
I want to have lovers buy the score

806
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,680
Movie producers knocking down my door

807
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:15,680
This is the faith that is in store for me

808
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Oh and I'm famous, I will wear a great trench coat and fake red hair

809
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,680
So they all will know that it is me

810
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,680
When they see me, how they'll smile

811
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,680
And me photographs to sign

812
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,680
I will say sorry babe

813
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Talk to my assistant

814
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,680
I want to be famous, I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

815
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,680
I want to be famous, I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

816
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Who's on the street?

817
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Then when I'm old, I'll have a ball

818
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,680
There'll be shocked that I'm living at home

819
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,680
When I enter the gas will fall

820
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
To the knees

821
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,680
And then ask that the throats of my enemies

822
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,680
Man, all I don't want is cheese

823
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,680
When I'm famous, famous, famous

824
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,680
So exhausting

825
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:57,680
I want to be famous, I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

826
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,680
I want to be famous, I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

827
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,680
Who's on the street?

828
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Then ask that the throats of my enemies

829
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Man, I want to be famous, I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

830
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,680
Who's on the street?

831
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,680
Then ask that the throats of my enemies

832
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,680
I want to be famous, I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

833
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
Who's on the street?

834
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Then ask that the throats of my enemies

835
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Man, I want to be famous, I want to have eyes as blue as the sea

836
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,680
I want to be my famous better than all of my fellow much better than all of her

837
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,680
I want to be famous slowly and I'll know nothing

838
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:02,680
I'll hand up bitter and ugly and old, not just my body but also my soul

839
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,680
But a legend is my goal and a legend I'll be

840
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,680
When I'm famous, not I will give for the little people

841
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,680
I'll dance when I'm famous

842
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,680
Hey, my famous, my my

843
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Philosophia's, famous on the source of code of apologies for the dropout

844
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,680
My Mac is not cooperating as it usually does

845
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,680
So I've been famous in one form another since I was 19 years old and believe me

846
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,680
There's not been a single single interview or publication anywhere that has gotten the story completely right

847
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:49,680
And it's just the way it goes and people take pot shots at you all the time and say the most mean and hurtful things

848
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,680
And often they think, hey, you know, you're a celebrity, you know, deal with it

849
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Or that's what you could pay for when you're in the public, you know

850
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,680
That's why I've been such a supporter of Michael Jackson

851
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:06,680
Because I, you know, certainly knowing him having met him once or twice, you know, I, you know, this just certain things I don't

852
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,680
I don't buy into and I know how it can spin out a control and Dave is doing a real good job

853
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:19,680
But you're really making me look bad and it's just not fair because this is the way publications go

854
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,680
And I'd suggest you go out and, you know, do some interviews and put your story out there

855
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,680
And, you know, and get your voice heard or if you don't believe in the mainstream media

856
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
They don't read it, you know, that's just the way it goes

857
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,680
You should know much better than that and it's really disappointing to hear the way you think of me

858
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:47,680
So, I will leave all of us now with the very wise words of Connie Francis

859
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
And it's the last I'm going to say about her

860
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:02,680
It's hard on just how it's happening

861
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:11,680
Can't you see the damage you have done

862
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:20,680
You have driven him away forever

863
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,680
Yeah, it's hard, now I'm the only one

864
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:39,680
I'm the only thing he left on

865
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:47,680
And I know he loved me at the start

866
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:57,680
And I know he hates the sight of all my stand-ups

867
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:05,680
All the cars of you will just find

868
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:24,680
And I know he loved me at the start

869
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,680
And I know he loved me at the start

870
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:38,680
And I know he loved me at the start

871
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,680
And I know he loved me at the start

872
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,680
And I know he loved me at the start

873
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,680
And I know he loved me at the start

874
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,680
And I know he loved me at the start

875
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:08,680
And I know he loved me at the start

876
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:16,680
And I know he loved me at the start

877
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,680
And I know he loved me at the start
