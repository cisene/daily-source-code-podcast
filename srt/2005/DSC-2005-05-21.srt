1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hey everybody how you doing this is Adam coming to you from San Diego, California

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,080
Hold on a second I was just checking out the Rockin' World Beach show here hold on

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,400
There we go

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,200
I figured I'd do a little update podcast from the road more for my girls Patricia and Christina

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,680
We're at home then for for anybody else

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,000
Because I kind of ruined their weekend. Here's the deal

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,640
Ron Blumen I was supposed to meet with a whole bunch of people in San Francisco Monday and Tuesday

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
and then go off to

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,080
Los Angeles Tuesday evening or even Wednesday I think and then

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,080
We had one meeting scheduled for Wednesday and then fly back from Los Angeles

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,120
Let's move some of the shit out of the way here and then fly back

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,360
I would fly back straight from Los Angeles to to London and

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
Then I got a couple of calls actually

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
Thursday

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,200
Saying hey, you know, there's this conference in San Diego

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,360
It's the

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Wall Street Journal

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Was it everything digital conference

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
And

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
There's a whole bunch of interesting people here

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,480
And a couple of them

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,160
I said well, you know if you're up in this in these neck of the woods once you or actually up once you come down to

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
San Diego and

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,600
We'll chat for a bit so

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,160
That's happening tomorrow Sunday you're probably hearing this Sunday actually it's Saturday night

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,440
It is

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,520
10 after nine

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,240
Local time. I got this great new watch from Patricia

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,120
I really love it. She gave it to me last week

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
It's it has three times on a three three clocks basically there's a main clock

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,400
Which I still have set to London time so it's 10 past five in the morning

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,280
Then I have two smaller

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,920
dials

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,640
At the bottom left hand one of course I have left coast

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,600
Which is west coast and the right-hand one is the east coast so it's 10 after midnight in

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,120
Well, basically New York or Florida wherever you may be on the east coast and

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
wrong was coming in from

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
From Miami

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,800
So he had a whole bunch of different flights. There's no direct connection by the way from will London to

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
San Diego

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
We changed planes somewhere or you can go to Los Angeles and drive. There's probably about

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,560
100 miles or so

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
So I decided to take a

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,120
United what is it sky west or whatever you know a small commuter play? I love those little planes

45
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
You know the width of propellers

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
Which basically has like 11 rows. I love those

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
You can't put me in enough of those

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
I really like it

49
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,640
So I've been here for about an hour how to quick shower just to freshen up because man that was a long traveling day

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,960
Basically pissed away the whole side of a traveling and it's it's a bummer because

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
Usually weekends are pretty holy for us

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,840
Back at the cottage and we all you know like to chill out hang out do stuff, you know do some shopping together or whatever

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,520
And so that just wasn't possible. So what I figured I'd do is just take you outside for a second. I have a

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Ground floor room. This is the kind of like a little terrace

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
And I walked through the

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
To the brush here and

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
And I'm right by the pool

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
It's almost a completely full moon. It's beautiful actually

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,240
I'll just have the quick walk around the premises with you

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,240
So I'm using the

61
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,560
The stereo lapel microphone which doesn't have the great dynamics that I usually like from the wireless transmitter

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,920
But it's so easy to set it up. Oh, what's that a rabbit? It's a rabbit right here on the path

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's sitting there in the light

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,440
This too bad you can't hear the rabbit because rabbits don't really make noise

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
That was a baby rabbit hey

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
He's pretty there he goes he's off

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Someone's uh

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Cleaning up pool area

69
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,320
The rabbit is still there and just move a few feet

70
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,600
Oh, such a petite cutie hey

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Oh, there he's gone

72
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
hiding in the brush

73
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,960
So I'm walking towards the back of this is the I should have mentioned this this is the

74
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Four seasons resort

75
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,880
Which

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
It's very chic

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Man there's nobody outside see what I have a view of here

78
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,640
Quite sure what water that is I can see cars and some hills on the other side

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's kind of nice

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,440
Let's walk around the other side and I'm safe distance from my room

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Don't have to tell you what that is

82
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
By the way

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Once again

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,680
Showed up at the airport eat ticket one way get that four S stamp on your ticket man. That just

85
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,560
That really that sucks

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,840
They really pulled me apart again, but they didn't even find my lighter

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
Which of course is contraband these days? You can't travel with a lighter on US flights

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So how good did they search?

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Listen to that

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
Crickets road noise all kinds of stuff

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
So anyway, so

92
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,440
Just gonna stay overnight here. I guess I'll wait until Ron comes in I probably don't think he lands until even quarter to ten

93
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,480
So probably get a quick bite to eat and we'll catch you up haven't seen each other for a couple of weeks

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Although we talk almost daily on Skype with everyone else who's working hard on

95
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Getting stuff up and running for pod show

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,400
That's not the same CO burplates in gentlemen. That's just a regular old my god. I've been traveling all day

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Oh, he's a road that goes down. Let's uh oh

98
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,440
Actually this is a complete road

99
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Wow

100
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
I wonder what's down here

101
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,520
Not much just some nice night sounds that I've been to San Diego. It's beautiful

102
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,840
Although it kind of feels like you're on the edge of the world about to fall off

103
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
I don't know if this is what I want to do

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,960
Because this going down is really steep

105
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Which means that

106
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,760
inevitably I'll have to walk the steep bit up the hill

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Fuck that I'm going back up

108
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Okay, so

109
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
There's lots of

110
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,920
Interesting people who were here. I don't even think they're here. They're probably showed tomorrow

111
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,320
I don't think this conference even really kicks off until tomorrow. We're not gonna stay for the conference

112
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,440
I think it's held by a guy called Walton Mossberg

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,960
Who is the technology writer for the Wall Street Journal and this and he's accredited as

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,960
Like the most powerful man and the universe when it comes to

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Technology

116
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,080
Reporting I think I've seen some of this stuff on

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,120
About podcasting maybe I don't I mean I recognize the name

118
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
But I think that

119
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,040
There was a time probably in Silicon Valley when

120
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,840
Guys like Mossberg really were really powerful until of course the internet gave us so many different ways to find

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,000
News information software et cetera

122
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
And I think it costs three and a half thousand dollars per person right

123
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't think so

124
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,400
It's a beautiful hotel. It's really it's a resort more than a hotel and can see that there's

125
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,520
Wow big sweet down here. That's beautiful

126
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
It's really nice rooms

127
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Great art on the wall

128
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
But it's pretty dead. Let me see. Oh, that's nine

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
What is it nine 15

130
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,240
Maybe everyone's eating or inside or whatever

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,480
The Wi-Fi is also a little funky here. It doesn't really work in the room you have to step outside

132
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,240
So it only works. Maybe that's just the ground floor or maybe it's just my room in particular or it doesn't work

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,400
So I'll have to put this on

134
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
On the 17 inch power book

135
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Compress it get it ready and then walk outside to actually upload it and do all the

136
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,720
All the entries for the weblog

137
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,760
I guess we could technically call this a daily source code

138
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,360
It'll be show number 181 and we've done exactly

139
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Let me see how many minutes

140
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,880
Oh perfect 10 minutes just a short little update and then tomorrow I can give you more I'm

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,680
Actually was considering doing a strategy cast with Ron while we're out here

142
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,840
That may have to wait until LA if we even have enough energy to do it

143
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,240
That travel and it really takes it out of you know, I basically traveled for

144
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
I don't know door to door

145
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,280
18 hours something like that you can tell now about the acoustics that I'm back in the terrace part

146
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,040
And through the sliding door back into my luxurious room

147
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
So that's it. That's what I'm up to

148
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,360
I'll be checking in from the road. I'll bring you a full source code on Monday of course

149
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,160
Which I may do Sunday night or I may do Monday afternoon west coast time probably trying to do with Sunday night

150
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
From so tomorrow night

151
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
We go to

152
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,200
San Francisco, which of course you can't get there from here directly, right?

153
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,320
So I think that's why I'm the Las Vegas for some stupid shit like that

154
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Anyway, quick 10 minute podcast

155
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,560
y'all have a great weekend and I'll be updating you tomorrow

156
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,040
Hopefully with the some information or some interesting news about some of the people in that here so take care
