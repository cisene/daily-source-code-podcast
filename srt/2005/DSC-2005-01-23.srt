1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Daily source code 123 2005, what do I do? Do I press pound or what? Is this thing on?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
On ground casting with Adam Curry. Hey everybody, it's a special weekend source code.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Right on, sitting up here in the lovely office at Curry Cottage. Hi everybody, it is Sunday.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's late afternoon. Actually it's almost the evening. It's a 615.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
As promised, in lieu of Friday show, this is the weekend source code.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, good news is, got back from Amsterdam.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And the bandwidth was still here.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So this is going to be kind of a little mellow show today.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Since, well, I haven't really prepared much. I think we just listened to a couple things.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But, you know, every once in a while when I come across an MP3 or a podcast or something that I like.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I drop it into a folder on my desktop. And then when I get ready to do a source code, then I just tell my application here.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My production suite to go scan through all the new files.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And it pulls out all the ID3 tags and makes a little shortcut in my outline.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But I can then copy and paste into a rundown.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Like, you care how I do that, right?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Anyway, so I hadn't really organized any stuff specifically to play today.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I found a few things. I've been playing around with Net Newswire.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As, you know, I try to get my hands on everything eye-patter.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Everything that looks, smells, feels like an eye-patter.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I'm actually in the throes of ordering a Windows machine.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Specifically to check out a couple of eye-patter's that just won't run on a Mac and thought.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So, playing around with Net Newswire, which I have to say, does eye-potting extremely well?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, it doesn't have the vacation feature, any of those things.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But it does do multiple concurrent downloads.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But downloads, I think it's default setting is for eight files at once.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, with a pipe that I've got now, I didn't even notice that it was downloading all these shows all over again.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So that wasn't too bad.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I-patter, the Lemon Edition apparently has come out with their beta.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There are two-point-o-beta-one.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I couldn't get it to run on my Mac. I submitted a bug report.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Something with, I looked at the console log, something about, I don't know if there's some error that's wrong.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But, of course, it's beta, so that's what it's supposed to do, right?

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, you're supposed to be reporting errors and helping the development team out.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Looks pretty good though, the screenshots are beautiful.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I've really- I started to notice that there's really two main approaches to iPodders.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I guess the thing that- it really tip me off when I was looking at Net Newswire, like, wait a minute.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is- this has a whole bunch of features that I really like.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And of course, that's an aggregator. It's been an aggregator since day one.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And it does a really good job with just aggregating and, you know, putting stuff away, downloading special times, filtering through

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
different types of fields. I mean, it really does have a lot of excellent options and rules settings.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And yeah, it's a Swiss Army knife of Macintosh aggregators.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Although, I do not like the three- pane approach.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I hate having an indicator. That's what I don't like about Net Newswire.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Now, there's an indicator in my- in my doc that says that, you know, has a little satellite icon for Net Newswire.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And it says, it has a three on it right now, meaning that there's three new pieces of information.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, I know that I'm only subscribed to podcasts and Net Newswire.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So the place I go to look for new shows is in iTunes.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And that's where it kind of came through, and it's like, well, wait a minute.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There are also some iPodder developments out there that are focusing from the player side.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
iPodder X, by the way, I think, is looking a lot more at the player, although,

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think they're pretty much using all the quick time components.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But really, a combination of the two is what seems to be like the sweet spot.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And I don't know if anyone's quite hit it yet, but maybe on some of the windows version that just haven't had a chance to check out.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So definitely looking forward to seeing some of those new windows things as well.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But Net Newswire, I'm going to try it out for a little bit more.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And I believe that there's also an iPodder X, 2.0 beta on the way.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I'm excited. This is the second round of iPodder development of the first two big teams.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So let's see what we've learned. I am really, really excited about this.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's see, Sunday afternoon, early evening.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It is, by the way, the 23rd of January 2005.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For the first time in a long time, I looked at my calendar, and it was absolutely nothing in it for the coming week,

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
although now it's filling up with the phone interviews and a couple of people want to do a photo shoot.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Particularly now, because, well, the hair is ruined, right?

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And notice by the way that I haven't posted any pictures of that, there is good reason my friends believe me.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And in the mail, I received, while I was an Amsterdam, I received two CDs from Dynamo's River Maces.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You remember we talked about them, also played a track or two.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So I actually got this from one of the band members.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I will put a link once again to their site in the production show notes for today's show.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But now I have real good quality recordings. This is great stuff.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hold on, let me just get the, let me get them hot.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There we go.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, shit.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, this is Dynamo's River Maces. This one is, I'm not saying, I'm just saying.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, but basically they do all these great versions of classic songs.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Like, addicted to love dancing in the street, hit me with your rhythm stick.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Born to run, see what a jump, ace of spades, hajo, my generation.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So all pod safe music and obviously stuff that we'll be playing for, well, I think about 24 tracks there.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can play a lot of this on the source code for the next coming shows.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And every single one is a hit, done just a little bit differently.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I think you'll like it.

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is a classic by Queen brought to you my Dynamo's River Maces.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Tonight, well, I'm going to have myself a real good sign.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Because I feel alive, man. I feel alive.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Like, I can take the world.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm just turning inside out, baby, and floating around in ecstasy.

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So don't stop me now.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't stop me, man.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Because I'm having a good sign, I'm having a good sign.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So I'll leave it to you to start.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Like, I can talk a good, fine, long, gravity.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Today, I'm a racing girl.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's in by.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I hate to get that vote.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But I have to know, no, no, no, no, hold in me.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But it's straight through the sky, yeah.

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So hundreds of degrees are by the communist firing heights.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We're driving at speed of light.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We want to make it super sunny, man.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know you.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, dude.

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So don't stop me now.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm having such a good time.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm having a vote.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Stop me now.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If you want to have a good time, give it a call.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But don't stop me.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Have a good time.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't stop me.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't stop me.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't stop me.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't stop me.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Because I'm rocking too.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm on his way to Mars.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm a collision course.

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Like satellite.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And I've control I'm sexy.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Great to reload.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like an out of bomb.

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I got the boom.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's low.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm shaking the sky again.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So hundreds of degrees are by the communist firing heights.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000

I want to make it super sunny, man.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Of you.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, dude.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So don't stop me now.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm having such a good time.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000

You have a good time.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't stop.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Say it.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000

So don't stop me.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't burn straight into the sky.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So hundreds of degrees are by the communist firing heights.

145

But don't wait a month.

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Not good at bomb.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I got a, got a, got a, got a man who got his vote.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I burn straight through the sky.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So hundreds of degrees are by the communist firing heights.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Driving at speed of light.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I want to make it super sunny, man.

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Of you.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, dude.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So don't stop me now.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm having such a good time.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm having a good vote.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Stop me now.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If you want to have a good time.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Give me a cough.

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't stop me.

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Have a good time.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't stop me.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't stop me.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't stop me, you're just my little girl.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Time, don't stop me.

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Have a good time, don't stop.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't stop.

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Don't stop me.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't stop me.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Have a good time.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Don't stop.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
nào lead good time, don't stop me.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't take good time.

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No.

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,500
I don't stop me.

198
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't take good time.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't stop me.

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Have a good time and don't stop, don't stop me.

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't take good time.

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't stop me.

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Stop me.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Stop me.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,500
Stop me.

206
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,500
It's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me

207
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Bloody record, the usual city

208
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
First time I heard that it did freak me out. I was like oh shit, something stuck

209
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
There was a future tense that came through the other aperture through that out shit. That was stupid

210
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:40,500
There was a future tense that I was talking about the record scratch and that even though the record scratch that

211
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:49,500
That's you know a needle being dragged off of a record even though that's one of the most used sound effects in advertising today

212
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Seeing if I still have it somewhere here

213
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,500
They did a survey and they asked a whole bunch of kids if they knew what that sound was they went

214
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeah, that's from the commercial they had never heard of it actually scratching on a record

215
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Let me see if I have that it was

216
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
I bet you don't have that anymore shoot

217
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Future tense. Oh, maybe this is it. Hold on. It'll be great if I still had that one. Let's check it out first

218
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Libraries get hip to really simple syndication. No, this is future

219
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
That wasn't that shoot

220
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Shoot, let me just check iTunes for a second. I bet you I tossed that out

221
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Okay, I'm probably get the yeah now it's gone darn

222
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
That would have been great to play for you right now

223
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,500
It was on the media anyway. I'll look it up for you. Okay, it was it was a podcast. That's for sure

224
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,500
That I do remember here's something that came across I think open podcast.org it showed up in my iTunes

225
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:55,500
And it's almost like poetry, but it was pretty good. It's about it's called Dead TV

226
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
It's done by Jenny Gillespie Gillespie

227
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:07,500
It speaks it speaks for itself. Let's sit back and chill. It's about two and a half minutes, but you won't want to fast forward because it's it's good

228
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Life TV is an even live TV. It's so dead to me. So orchestrated so seamlessly so perfectly. I'm telling you it's dead TV

229
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Our perfect people they brush their teeth before they go on the air someone somewhere counts down from five to one

230
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Making their colgate smile shine on like the sun and over their paper props and coffee mugs painted a stylish navy blue

231
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:40,500
They deliver us the news with delicate creases and their dry clean sports jackets and their neat little bundles of free striped telecast packets

232
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:48,500
They have appropriate faces and tones for all their heart wrenching recitals with a rather catchy title that rhymes of course

233
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:57,500
About some golden retriever dancing for the sick kids that we who and we are over because you know that stories vital

234
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:07,500
But not so urgent so meaningful so necessary that we can't lay our heads down on our pillows and sleep that night leaving behind us the senses sympathy

235
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,500
We like to portray to star new day where no one else matters but ourselves

236
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,500
But those people from the news God damn they have it's so great

237
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,500
They're everyone super hero everyone's best friend our favorite face on our cable access station

238
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,500
They're so trustworthy so reliable. They have that that chronic dedication

239
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,500
They have the stuff that it takes to relate 45 minutes worth of truth and nothing but

240
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Okay, maybe there's a bud there's you know societies buy a certain in there to spice it up a bit

241
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,500
But I mean they have plastic hair like burvey dolls and spray paint and make up it's fucking impenetrable

242
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:55,500
So what's the new fat in the news today politics or politics and when it comes down to it we could care less really

243
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:03,500
We want a generic black man with a sought off shotgun running rampant and someone else is suburban streets killing him some

244
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Blonde hair blue eyed chair leaders so sweet. We want the story. We want it concrete

245
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Who cares about the sources or if the you know facts are incomplete?

246
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:24,500
We'll put it on repeat on every fucking channel until everyone from the Pope to your grandmother wants to donate just 50 cents to the cause

247
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:32,500
So the informed public will raise you up in a plus the thank you being a great aid citizen

248
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
That's simply just a perp

249
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Great stuff, huh? Yeah, first time I heard that I was like wow

250
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,500
That's good Jenny Gillespie don't know anything about her. I presume she wrote it herself

251
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
But don't like that very much when I heard it

252
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,500
A lot of people pointed me towards this podcast from what is it?

253
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
This show has no name is the name of the podcast

254
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I pointed to it in the production show notes

255
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
It's got a home page stop macadress

256
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
So it shouldn't be a problem if you want to download the show

257
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Because I know that sometimes when I mention someone's podcast and we get it like a little mini slash dot effect

258
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Not that there's so many people that I'm sending over your way, but

259
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Because the files are so big

260
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Anyway, I listened to it and I was like wow, you know

261
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Here's a guy who listens to the daily source code every single day and a second tired of me

262
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Finally, I'm sure there's more out there

263
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
But he put it in a podcast something I totally, totally appreciate

264
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,500
And I thought we'd listen to it together because there's some interesting things in here that I'm sure other people are thinking

265
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,500
They're maybe a few misconceptions and some things, I think he's probably right about

266
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,500
A couple of the things I want to talk about is that I want to make it official now that I'm pretty much sick of Adam Curry

267
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Okay, I'm glad you made that official, that's a good start

268
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm sick of him in general, I'm sick of his podcast

269
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Even though I listen to it all the time and I'm relatively addicted to it

270
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
And there's some couple things that I'm really bothered by

271
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,500
And mainly because, you know, everybody's pretty nice

272
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,500
And he seems like a nice guy, but it's really his podcast, it's kind of bothered me more than anything

273
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Okay, I've seen like a nice guy only when I'm podcasting, which is the only way he knows me

274
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
That's not starting to bother me

275
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,500
And it's just that not that I want to be sour grapes or anything

276
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,500
But you know what, drum cadence suck

277
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Okay, let me just put that out there

278
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
There was maybe one or two that was pretty good

279
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I understand that he's having a hard time because you can't get any good RIA

280
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,500
No, no, that's not true. No, I'm receiving more drum cadences than any other music period

281
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
That's why I think playing so much of it

282
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Actually, I haven't played a lot in the past week and a half to be free music and that's running

283
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,500
But the drum kids, just they just got to go

284
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
I mean, really, you know

285
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Dude, fast forward, that's all, he'll show you how it works

286
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
So the 10 that's a drum case

287
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
That's not that cool, I'm sorry

288
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
I found myself just skipping through the whole thing

289
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Right, this thing is just that

290
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
You know, I'm so sick of those serious bitties

291
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Maybe he's got some sort of a financial thing

292
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
He keeps saying that he is a businessman

293
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
And I think that people keep forgetting that in their days

294
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Oh, hold on a second, hold on a second

295
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:35,500
First of all, I have absolutely no financial arrangement or any type of deal

296
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
whatsoever with any of the list of his bitties

297
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Except they have promised me a big hug when we meet up in New York

298
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
That they have promised

299
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Because believe me, dude

300
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I think that's something I would have to disclose

301
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Right, like tell you about

302
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Believe me, I would tell you if I had any financial gain

303
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
But yes, I am a businessman, absolutely

304
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,500
And I love it when I see people who are already doing business

305
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Like those serious bitties

306
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Do more business because of something really simple

307
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Mainly people who like their music or play in their music and podcast

308
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
So I see that as a good thing

309
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
That's a ties by the fact that he's going to find a way to make money

310
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Either this podcast and thing

311
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
He's going to milk it for his good

312
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Oh, all right, okay

313
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
And you know what that's probably what they said

314
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Well, okay, yes, of course

315
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Of course, I'm going to milk it to death, damn it

316
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Oh, wow

317
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
If you know how

318
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Please put that in your podcast so I can start milking

319
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,500
And I think that's something that people should be very aware of

320
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
And understand that the reason he's so pumped about this

321
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Because he sees a monetary opportunity there

322
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Okay, first of all

323
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
The reason this all got started was out of frustration

324
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Because I wanted to get pod cat or MP3 files onto my iPod

325
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
It was no absolutely no fine

326
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
In fact, I tried to pay people to do that for me

327
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
But I have to admit

328
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
That there's totally

329
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,500
A lot of interest from the business community

330
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
From the financial community

331
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
A lot of people are saying, hey, how can we monetize this

332
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Am I looking, of course I'm looking

333
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
To have ideas, of course I have ideas

334
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Of course I do, is that wrong?

335
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Apparently

336
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
It's reminds me so much of

337
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
When I started out

338
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
With something I called cyber sleeves

339
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,500
And I was promoting that on my radio shows

340
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
And it's actually this was before mtv.com

341
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
And I remember that all the, not all

342
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
But the, the quote community at the time

343
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Was very against the commercial internet

344
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
It was like, you know, commercial was bad

345
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
It's not going to happen

346
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
It's going to fight against it, will hack you to death

347
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
It sounds like the same thing, you know

348
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
It's like, of course someone's going to

349
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Commercialize parts of pod casting

350
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I heard someone say, I don't know where it was

351
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I think it was maybe it was a pod cat

352
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm thinking, I'm going to say pod cast brothers

353
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Because it was a brilliant analogy

354
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
That whenever there's a, there's a gold rush

355
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
The people who always make the money

356
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Are the outfitters

357
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
So that's the people who supply the horses

358
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
The wagons, the donkeys

359
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,500
The shovels, the spades, you know, the tents

360
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Whatever, of course

361
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,500
And we really don't have a pod casting service

362
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Yeah, do we, this is one of the things of course

363
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
That we've been looking at

364
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
And what does that entail?

365
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I think the number one place to make money right now

366
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Is helping people make pod casts

367
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
I don't think there's a lot of people making money

368
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
On their pod casts right now

369
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Nor is it clear if they will

370
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I got some ideas

371
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
But yeah, of course I'm looking at ways to make money

372
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
But I'm not hiding that

373
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm not doing the source code

374
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Because I have some genius plan

375
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
That's going to make me billions of dollars

376
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Through that show alone

377
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I like doing it dude

378
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
And don't be lulled

379
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Into thinking that this guy

380
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Who is now

381
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
God, I've seen it now on

382
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
In a macadic magazine

383
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I've seen it in New York Times

384
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I've seen it on ABC

385
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
I've seen it everywhere

386
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Because they all call me up

387
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
And ask me for interviews

388
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
It actually takes a lot of time

389
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
And I don't have an actual job at the moment

390
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
We'll talk about that in a second

391
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm sure

392
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
So I could make time

393
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Which I think is also help

394
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Propel pod casting

395
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
For good or for bad

396
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500
He's going to make money off of this

397
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Oh, I can't wait

398
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
And you and me are probably not going to do that

399
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
You and me presuming me the listener

400
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
The way to me

401
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
You just told me I was

402
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
But as a listener, I'm not

403
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Mainly because we're probably a really well-versed

404
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
And making money off of something like this

405
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Dude, I've never made money off of anything like this

406
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Let me tell you how I made my money

407
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Okay

408
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I might be good

409
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I started

410
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Actually, it did start a content company

411
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Called OnRamp

412
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,500
And we had actually Metaverse.com

413
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
And we had cyber sleeves

414
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
And we had a whole bunch of cool sites

415
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
This is around the time that addicted to noise

416
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
It was also a

417
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Some of you might remember that website

418
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
That was purchased later by MTV

419
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
And we were making content for

420
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Re-box for Budweiser

421
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
For continental airlines

422
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
For Procter and Gamble

423
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Hey, we did tampax.com

424
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,500
The website you'll want to visit more than once a month

425
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
We haven't fun

426
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
And we just started going more and more into the service side of stuff

427
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
She's going to be providing services for companies

428
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
At the time when you could charge $40,000

429
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
For what I knew eventually

430
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
And what now are indeed tools that cost $40

431
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
And so we did a good job

432
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
We worked really hard for about five years

433
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
And we sold the company in 1999

434
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Always made a profit

435
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
At the end of our tenure

436
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
There I say ours, my partner Ron

437
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,500
We had a pay roll of $65 million

438
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
And we always made pay roll

439
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
And we were profitable and we had

440
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Happy clients

441
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
And we did good work

442
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
We were advertising agency basically

443
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
And I made money on that

444
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,500
But the real money I made came from lucky investments

445
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
And the real money I lost by the way

446
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I also lost a lot of money came from unlucky investments

447
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
But that's his goal

448
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
And I think...

449
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
No, no, sorry, that's so my goal is not to make money

450
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
My goal is to...

451
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Well, to have fun doing whatever I'm doing

452
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
And if possible

453
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Make the world a better place while we do it

454
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
And fuck yeah, I'd like to get paid

455
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Doesn't everybody?

456
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
I mean, everyone has bandwidth bills

457
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Has, you know, your time is worth something

458
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
And either you say this is 100% hobby for me

459
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Or you say, hey, I'm going to try and make something out of this

460
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Not in wrong with that

461
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Yeah, as much as he would like to be

462
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Befriending all these other people

463
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Well, no, I am actually befriending people

464
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Because I make friends pretty easily

465
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
And I would pretty good track record with friends

466
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
You can look it up dude

467
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
And whether it's he wants to be the little

468
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Sivius Bitties Manager or whatever that

469
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
I don't...

470
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
I wish, God damn

471
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
I'd love to be their manager

472
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Hmm, I think they have that all sold up

473
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
I actually, I was talking to Leon

474
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I've got you such an angelic voice

475
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Even on the phone she sounds so, so pretty

476
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,500
And she was telling me about, oh, we just shoot in the shit actually

477
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,500
And I said, well, you know, because they were interviewed by CBS

478
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
For the CV, I don't know when this piece is going to air

479
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
But it should be reasonably soon, I guess

480
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
And I was so happy for it

481
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
And I said, you know, you're going to get calls pretty soon

482
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,500
And stuff's going to happen, she said, oh, we, you know, we have had such a luxury over

483
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
They've been doing it for like seven or eight years

484
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
They really have all their finances, their legal stuff

485
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
It's all, I mean, not that they have a lot of finances

486
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
But it's, they have that all set

487
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
And I said, anything you need, let me know

488
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Dude, of course I'd like to be their manager

489
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
But that's not why I'm playing their songs

490
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Because I'd like their songs, that's why

491
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,500
But I think that that's something that is

492
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Is true in call speed of speed

493
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
You know, and any...

494
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
You know, he's, he's alluded to that

495
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
He said, you know, hey, he's a businessman

496
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
He's the most big money, there's nothing wrong with that

497
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,500
But don't be low than the thinking that

498
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,500
He's just this super nice guy that's just trying to

499
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Really help everybody out

500
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Yeah, I actually believe it or not

501
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I mean, I'd be a super nice guy

502
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
But I do like to help everybody out

503
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
And I think that by helping each other

504
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
We'll be able to figure some stuff out

505
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,500
And actually maybe, you know, work together on some things

506
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,500
That could be fun to work on or could generate revenue together

507
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Or kinds of stuff, but I'm not like

508
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Something like job and life to go around

509
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
You know, sucking up to people

510
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
And getting to be my friends

511
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,500
And then go make money off of them

512
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Which of course we haven't established exactly how to do that

513
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
I think in a lot of ways you may be

514
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
But I think in the back of his money he's going to say

515
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
You know what?

516
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
I kind of think money at this

517
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,500
I mean, just look at the sound scene thing

518
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Hey, baby

519
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Hey

520
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
I'm doing a podcast

521
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
New?

522
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Umm Hmm

523
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
How much time would I have?

524
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Are you ready right now?

525
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Okay, what should I do?

526
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
So till the audience, or I've put them on paws

527
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Or should I put its good stuff right now?

528
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Should I put the audience on paws?

529
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Yeah

530
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Alright everybody, you're going on paws

531
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
I'm going to have dinner

532
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Come back and we'll continue

533
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Do do do want

534
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Right, okay

535
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
So I'm back

536
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,500
That was two and a half hours ago that we last spoke.

537
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Okay.

538
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
You get the fast forward.

539
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
I get to hit the pause button once in a while.

540
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,500
And actually it's pretty good because I was thinking,

541
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,500
but after dinner, Patricia and I were watching,

542
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
we were watching, and Tiggs Roadshow.

543
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Love that show.

544
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Of course, it's not really about the antiques or the objects that they display.

545
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
It's what's worth.

546
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
That's the game, right?

547
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Okay.

548
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
I think that's going to be worth about,

549
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
and probably about 3,400,

550
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,500
and then once when you get the 10,000 pound valuable item,

551
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
whatever.

552
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,500
And then Patricia Files sleep, so I went to clean up the kitchen.

553
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,500
And I was thinking about the comment about the Sylvia's Bitties.

554
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,500
And I was thinking, you know, what is it that I like so much?

555
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:52,500
And I thought back to the early 80s when I was just really getting into top 40 radio.

556
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,500
It was, you know, there was still an opportunity back then to actually play a song that you thought,

557
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,500
and I think it was like once an hour in most formats that that I worked with,

558
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
at most radio stations.

559
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Not really in the, yeah, it was very early 80s.

560
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,500
At least had one song an hour that you could kind of, you know,

561
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
fuzzle around or legally play as one of your own picks.

562
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
And before that, you know, we used to just, you know,

563
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
bring whatever, whatever the hell we wanted to play,

564
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,500
but of course those weren't very commercially successful radio stations,

565
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
which will tell you a lot about, you know,

566
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
what needs to be done to become commercially successful.

567
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,500
But, and it could be anything, particularly in Holland,

568
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,500
where I started my radio career,

569
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,500
and Bruce Springsteen never really caught on big in the chart.

570
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
And I say chart because back then, you know, there was a chart,

571
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
it was the top 40.

572
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
And then, of course, we got the, the top 50,

573
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
and then the top 40 album and singles and airplane.

574
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
And these days, you have the top download chart.

575
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
So there's no real authority, you know, it's a,

576
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
but that used to be very simple.

577
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,500
It was compiled based upon actual sales figures.

578
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,500
But also, some audience research was put in there.

579
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,500
And it was, it was a, it was a good chart.

580
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,500
And you could get it, you know, and if you played a song

581
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,500
and then some of the other DJs from other stations

582
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
or your own station would also play that song,

583
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
then it could get some momentum, you know,

584
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
and then you'd break an artist.

585
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
And that was something that we were proud of, you know,

586
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
it's like dude.

587
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,500
And I've actually broken a couple artists in Holland

588
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
that people will attribute to me.

589
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,500
I laughed because Renee Froker is probably,

590
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,500
the one that became most famous after I,

591
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
I broke him as an artist.

592
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
It sounds weird, doesn't it?

593
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
It's like a real industry term.

594
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
I broke you, boy.

595
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,500
He's kind of like the Dutch Engelbert Humperding.

596
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,500
So that's why I'm chuckling.

597
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
But anyway, I digress.

598
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
I was had a joint after dinner.

599
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
I forgot to mention that.

600
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
So that's why you get like.

601
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Okay.

602
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,500
So, but it really was all about, you know,

603
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
it was just pride.

604
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,500
And then it would be even better if that artist went on

605
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
to get a gold record.

606
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,500
And, you know, somewhere down the line,

607
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
you would actually be presented with something like that,

608
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
like a gold record or platinum record or whatever.

609
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,500
And it says, you know, thanks for your thanks for contributing

610
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,500
to the success of the album or the artist or whatever,

611
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
depending on what your contribution was.

612
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Literally.

613
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
And there was no money that passed hands.

614
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
You know, this is just a part of a thing that happened.

615
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
And it just started to roll and snowball.

616
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,500
And, you know, and something would catch on.

617
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
And then the audience would catch on and it just goes, right?

618
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
But sometimes songs need a little bit more.

619
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,500
And you know, I guess they're more complex or something or whatever.

620
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,500
So, as I was saying, Bruce Springsteen was something that

621
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,500
buddy and I broke in Holland.

622
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,500
It was dancing in the dark.

623
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
It just wasn't catching on.

624
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
But there's been, you know, lots of examples like that.

625
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,500
And even at MTV in the very early days when I was there,

626
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
which was still the 80s, you know,

627
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
you could still kind of have some kind of influence.

628
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
But it just went away.

629
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,500
And also, the gold record started going to everybody,

630
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
like the sales guy and, you know, the station manager,

631
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
and became more cheesy.

632
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,500
And, you know, more like production work, nothing,

633
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
it used to be that you could actually play these records.

634
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
They would be the, they weren't really, well,

635
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
they were dipped in gold, I think.

636
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,500
But most of them, the original records that were given to, you know,

637
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,500
given to the artist based upon huge amounts of sales,

638
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,500
were the mother or father masters when they were still pressing records.

639
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,500
And you could actually take them out and play them.

640
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
You have to play them backwards, though,

641
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,500
because it's a reverse of what you'd actually have in the vinyl.

642
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,500
And Patricia has a lot of the original type of gold records.

643
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
And one time by my radio show, we took one out of the casing

644
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
and played it backwards.

645
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
And it actually was the real record.

646
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,500
But I never got the casing back together the way it was intended to be.

647
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
So I'm not allowed to demonstrate that anymore.

648
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I've been banned from touching the gold records and rightly so.

649
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,500
But anyway, it's nothing about, you know,

650
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,500
about wanting to do anything more than just have that feeling.

651
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
That's a great feeling when it works.

652
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,500
And that, I guess that's what kind of, what,

653
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
what, that's what the kick is about that.

654
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
I get out of playing the civvies, bitis, and bitis,

655
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
and hearing people catch on and like it,

656
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,500
and watching them get famous.

657
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,500
You know what?

658
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
I'm tired of this.

659
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Let's do something else.

660
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
We do live from your headphones.

661
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
It's asked Uncle Know It All.

662
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Hello everyone and welcome to this week's edition of Ask Uncle Know It All.

663
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,500
This week's question comes to us from Sex Kitten, who asks?

664
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Dear Uncle Know It All.

665
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm writing because I'm wondering, what's the deal with the cowbell?

666
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Thanks so much.

667
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Hugs and kisses.

668
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Love you.

669
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Sex Kitten.

670
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Well, Sex Kitten.

671
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
Sometime ago, VH1 aired a documentary

672
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,500
of the blue oyster cult in studio recording their hit song,

673
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
don't fear the reaper.

674
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
While they were recording, Bruce Dickinson made comments

675
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
about how he loved the cowbell sound

676
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
who, done by one of the band members.

677
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Now, this caused something of a stir in the current music industry.

678
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
And as a result of this footage,

679
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
next March, Virgin Records is releasing the cowbell collection,

680
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,500
which is a collection of both old and new songs

681
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
featuring Greg Groups on cowbell.

682
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,500
Now, if managed to secure an advanced copy of this CD,

683
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500
and I'll be playing a couple of samples for you.

684
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Our first sample is,

685
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Stip Tiffany's recorded by Deep Blue Something.

686
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
This next song was recorded by Metallica,

687
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
entitled Enter Sandman.

688
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
And last but not least,

689
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
we have gin and juice,

690
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
courtesy of Grandmaster Rapa, Snoop Dogg.

691
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
As you can see, or rather, here,

692
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
the cowbell can be used with a variety of different music styles.

693
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500
In fact, there's only one style of music that the cowbell

694
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
cannot help.

695
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
It's not that easy.

696
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
It's not that easy.

697
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,500
As you can see, or rather, here,

698
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,500
the cowbell can be used with a variety of different music styles.

699
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
In fact, there's only one style of music that the cowbell

700
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
cannot help, and that's country,

701
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,500
because nothing can help country music.

702
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Now, inside sources also tell me that

703
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
P. Diddy will be releasing a new album entitled

704
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Cowbell in the Hizzles,

705
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,500
which features remakes of every song

706
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
on the Cowbell collection.

707
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
And that about wraps it up for this week.

708
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Don't forget, send me your questions,

709
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
your questions, make the show.

710
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
You can email Soundclips or just type the question

711
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
if you prefer.

712
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,500
The email address is Uncle Know It All at gmail.com.

713
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Thanks.

714
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
On Cowboy Casting with Adam Curry.

715
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Say it again!

716
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Nothing gives me doubt.

717
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
To do how to talk.

718
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
To seem to talk to Rahan.

719
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Maybe I know.

720
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Just how to feel.

721
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Let's say you got bro-o-o with a budget

722
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
to get to what's real.

723
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
We can't see instead of here.

724
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
We've got the back of your gaze.

725
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
We're breaking the sheet.

726
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
I have the rest to see.

727
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,500
We'll be able to see what I mean.

728
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Well, you might as well jump.

729
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Go ahead and jump.

730
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Man, I'll say jump.

731
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Go ahead and jump.

732
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Hey hanger.

733
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
It's you.

734
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Go ahead and jump.

735
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Go ahead and jump.

736
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Me and I said jump, jump, go ahead and jump

737
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I said jump, jump, go ahead and jump

738
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,500
People I said jump, jump, go ahead and jump

739
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Hold jump the whole time

740
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Hold jump, go ahead and jump

741
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Okay, you can see it was down here, got the back against the rain from the sheet

742
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,500
I have the words you've seen, maybe see what I mean

743
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Hold jump, go ahead and jump

744
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Oh, they're a classic difference

745
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Say you might as well jump

746
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,500
You're head and jump

747
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Come on and jump

748
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Go ahead and jump

749
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Man I said jump

750
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
Go ahead and jump

751
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Come on, now jump

752
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Time is rhythm and sense

753
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
And then all I know for today's daily source code

754
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Actually, this special one we can make up for this new source code

755
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,500
How's the difference?

756
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,500
How's the difference?

757
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Yeah, I've got to play more of those guys.

758
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
I say rock.

759
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
All right, everybody, that's it.

760
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Have a good weekend.

761
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

762
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Or maybe you're just getting this.

763
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
And it's already Monday morning.

764
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
So then you have another source code on the way later on.

765
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,500
I'm going to leave it for this for now.

766
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Of course, comments.

767
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
I don't have to worry.com.

768
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
If you've got an MP3 comment,

769
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
send it to MP3 feedback at gmail.com.

770
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
And of course, comments on the web

771
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
longer, always run.

772
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Some power.

773
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Some power.

774
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Some power.

775
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
www.create.com.

776
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Thanks for watching.
