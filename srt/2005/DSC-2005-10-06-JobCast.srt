00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, hi, everybody. I'm back. This is a special addition to the daily source code for Thursday, October 6, 2005.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I was so preoccupied with everything going wrong with my Mac that I completely forgot to bring you the job cast.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So doing this is a separate file, feel free to send it to your friends or whatever.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It'll be small enough. You can just download this and practically email it with somebody.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We've got a lot of stuff going on. We have four reasonably big projects happening out pod show.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And one of those like the pod safe music network.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And what we're realizing is that we're missing a critical, well actually we know we're missing a critical person in the organization.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We just really haven't been able to find this person yet.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So this is a job cast. It's an opening at pod show full-time position.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Anyone can apply. It's all about the experience.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is really a job where someone has a very specific type of experience.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's for in the Bay Area. So you have to come to the office. It's not a virtual job.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So if you don't live in the Bay Area then, you know, unfortunately, you know, just the speed that we need someone, etc.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's just not going to work.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And what we're looking for is someone who has a lot of experience with the heavy iron of the world.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we're talking about reasonably large hosting environments.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you have experience with like multi-user setups, let me give an example.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, for instance, like if you have example with setting up multiple mobile type web logs or WordPress or systems like that,

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it's all lamp Linux Apache, mySQL and PHP, then we're looking for you.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And send your CV and a little bit about yourself. And by the way, I love it when people say here's what I can do for you.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I love it when you start off like that.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
