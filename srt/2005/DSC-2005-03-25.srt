Daily source code for March 25th, 2005 you're DJ you're DJ has only just big transmitters

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,120
We don't need no stinking transmittance

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,920
Autistic it's that I'm curing. It is Friday. Thank God

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Everybody how you doing? Welcome to the Daily Source Code Friday March 25th, 2005

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,400
It's another beautiful day here outside Curry Cottage in Surrey and the UK

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,080
The once again I can see all the way to the rising

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,640
Just a few scattered clouds and full sunshine

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,280
Okay, that was my DJ a bit for the day

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
One down the week

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,000
So it's been a pretty busy one and today almost felt like Saturday of course it's a holiday for a many around the world

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,960
A bank holiday in many cases where I believe

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,240
Which means the bank's your clothes, right? Or it's definitely something like that

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,160
Got the email is over which is always find an entertaining

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,600
It's fun explaining podcasts to them. You know what they get it that was the coolest part of

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Talking them last night

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,520
Got a couple of things we'll be doing today. Let's see a

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,520
New podcast theme song not for this one but for another one I'll play for you

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,400
Pete to pronounce checks in with another edition of Ressweb audio

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,680
We've got another aviation podcast for listen to of course you don't pull it with a hit test

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,080
I will be taking a look at the g bag

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,440
Which is the new name for my

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,040
Gmail overload and we'll pull somebody email out of that

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,800
And it was another one of those days where the weather was just so nice

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,440
You know and you kind of come into yourself. I thought oh I wouldn't be a great song to play for you

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,360
But I just share with my friends listening to the daily source code so I ran over to iTunes

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,000
Looked up sure enough there it was I was able to buy it online and share it with you

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,160
Hopefully doesn't mind lovely hurts with that you baby

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,600
Run around town like full and you think that it's good and bad

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,160
You give a smile of a guy

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,160
You give to the eye. You don't get love at the community

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
You say it is fun and you embrace so much

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
It's like me

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
But don't you know you're turning me home

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,520
And all that's wrong

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
But I can't stop

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,120
Hey, it's time to be very nice

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,560
Never really had a suit like you love really bad suit like you

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,280
And it's breaking my heart for what you do

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,560
But I never really had a suit like you love really has to run

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,280
And it's breaking my heart for what you do

41

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,460
So give me a sign

47
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,460
But the hell do you use

48
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,960
And I am signifying

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Love really hurts when I hear

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Love really hurts when I hear

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
And it's pretty long

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
No one can help you

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Love really hurts when I hear

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Love really hurts when I hear

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
And it's pretty long

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
No one can help you

57
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Love really hurts when I hear

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Love really hurts when I hear

59
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
And it's pretty long

60
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
No one can help you

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Love really hurts when I hear

62
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:55,960
What Can I put it's really hard to put it

63
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Telehotion

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Love really hurts when I hear

65
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Without you, babe

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Baby-sourced cold Fridays, song of the day

67
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,040
purchase done iTunes, played for you, one time sharing deal only, of course, does not

68
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,080
condone doing that in your own podcast. I wish someone would send me a song just like

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,960
this, you know, nice and happy and, you know, a real good Friday feel that was pod save.

70
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,920
That would, I should talk to CC over at AxonHash and get him to send me a song for the

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,320
day or something. I just, it's was good, you know, when you can play that, Billy Ocean.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,080
Interesting guy, met him a couple times back in the 80s on the TV shows,

73
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,120
smart guy too, but I have no idea what he's doing now. What is Billy Ocean up to? He's probably

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,280
producing other people and making tons of money, something like that. So it's actually the sun just

75
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,800
kind of started to slip away. It's a 430 in the afternoon here at the cottage. I've got my cup of

76
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:05,160
Senseo. He laws a real coffee drinkers. So the thing is just doing overtime. You've got the double

77
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,000
bagger in there. There's a little, uh, there's a little cup that you put your coffee pod in. And if you

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,320
want to sit in more than one cup, then if you want to make more, if you want two cups, they have to

79
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,000
put two bags in unless, you know, you like really watery coffee. Um, and so you have to put another

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,800
container, they're different, uh, a different cup holder basically for two pods stacked on top of each

81
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,640
other. So the thing is just, uh, it's working. And, uh, I wonder if there's a, a life span on a machine

82
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,000
like that. I wonder if it just breaks after a while. It's good, though. I was listening to, uh,

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,440
I should drip some coffee on my pants. I was listening to, uh, yeast radio this morning, uh,

84
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,760
Madge Weinstein. I'm trying to open up this note in my outline. I'm doing it via VNC, which is

85
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,760
like a remote screen application. There we go. And, uh, um, there seems to be some confusion, uh,

86
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:03,480
he was interviewing Eric Rice, and Eric, uh, was retelling parts of the story about how, uh,

87
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,760
Dave and I were a Dave Weinstein, and I were confused about, uh, Madge Weinstein. And we talked

88
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,400
about that on a trade secrets. And for some reason, Laura has become that we didn't know that Madge

89
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,760
was, I can't speak on, uh, on behalf of Dave, obviously. Um, but the law or somehow has become that

90
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:29,400
I didn't know that, um, Madge wasn't a woman. It's like, you know, dudes, duh. No, um, what, what

91
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,600
had surprised me at the time was that Madge, uh, was actually a character created by someone else.

92
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,160
I thought, you know, it really was a Jewish transgender, or, uh, gay man, 50 years old,

93
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,880
living in Chicago. Um, that's what surprised me. Um, and it's interesting because I told Madge,

94
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,280
uh, that personally, and, uh, she didn't defend me. Damn lesbian, what can you expect?

95
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,960
I was actually pretty funny is I listened to, uh, most of the podcasts on my set-up here at home

96
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,040
through the speakers. And they, you know, I said, basically run it from iTunes right off of my

97
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Mac, and that I run that through my board, and then run actually, I do it a little differently.

98
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,920
If you don't mind, if, uh, just indulge me for a moment, I'll tell you exactly how it's, I have it set

99
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:22,120
up. Um, so I have an older power book on my desk that, uh, is connected to a cinema display.

100
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,480
And the, this display, the screen of that laptop broke and I just, you know, didn't work out

101
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,840
from me to send it away, and so I never did, and so I just used it on the external screen.

102
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,280
It has a kind of noisy fan that's starting to act up a little bit now.

103
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,280
But essentially, I, uh, that's sitting on the desk, and that is, uh, I don't really run any big

104
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,160
applications on that. Um, there's three accounts, Christina, and Patricia can log in, because

105
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,320
this is an eye, an eyesight connected to it, so we use that for video conferencing when any of us are

106
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:58,440
on the road or away. Yeah, when Christina's on our world tour, right? And, um, I use this program

107
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,000
called VNC, which is really cool. It's an open source application. You can get a server for it

108
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,400
and a client. And the server, you run it any computer that you want to grab the screen and grab

109
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,600
control of. And of course, you use the client to do, to do that, perform that act. But it works on

110
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,280
Mac, Windows, uh, Unix, Linux, and on the Mac, it's cool. I haven't installed on most of my Macs.

111
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,280
I can just, uh, SSH in, uh, and issue a command line VNC, and it'll start up the server,

112
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,480
which I can kill later for security purposes. Um, and, you know, as a basic, I can control any

113
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,720
machine on my network that way. And it works on Windows as well, except you have to really have

114
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,320
a server running in the background. They don't have a easy command line way to do it. I'm not that

115
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm not that I'm aware of at least. Um, uh, so I control, uh, my power book, which really is my,

116
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,320
my workstation has everything on it. I have the audio out going into the board that comes through

117
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,680
a channel. The audio in is actually the monitor bus. So that way, if I want, I can send audio to someone

118
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,360
who's listening to me on Skype, and I can record them at the same time without they're being this

119
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,560
loop, and, you know, it, uh, basically creating havoc and feedback. Uh, I can route two microphones

120
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,320
through it, and then I have a, uh, a record out on the compact four mixer that I have. And I run that

121
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,960
to my M audio fire wire device, and that actually goes right into the old laptop sitting my desktop.

122
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,200
From there, I use a program called Line In from Rogamiba, um, and I just select the, uh,

123
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,440
M audio device. And now I can route anything I want to the beautiful Harman card and, uh,

124
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,400
uh, speakers that are attached to my Mac. So I hope that made sense. Um, when my microphone is

125
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,120
uh, switching on a little bit. Let me just tighten that up. Oh, uh, here we go.

126
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,760
Fair, perfect. Um, so, uh, I'm, I listen, I was listening to, uh, to Magic and Eric Banner

127
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,600
away, and I'm like, I keep, keep looking around. I was like, oh, it's someone's sending me

128
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,960
to Skype instant message. Like, yeah, but it was actually, uh, coming through from Magic's computer,

129
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,640
and I tell you, it, it's happened a couple times. I was listening to a podcast where people are

130
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,000
doing something on Skype and chatting with each other, and I'm looking at, you know, who's

131
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,640
Skypeing me now. I don't see any windows opening up. That's kind of freaky when, uh, when that happens.

132
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Uh, let me see. Oh, uh, remember yesterday I was talking about, uh, actually I read the email about the,

133
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,520
the pilot, uh, who listened to the daily source code at 37,000 feet, and he had this beautiful email

134
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,280
that he sent, which is, it was, it was virtually poetry. Uh, you got to love this podcasting stuff,

135
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,840
man. It came back to me today in a little different form.

136
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,120
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass than the next generation radio

137
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,440
content in my ears. I like to think I'm flying into the future.

138
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,880
It's Adam Curry.

139
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,040
Damn, I love that. That should be my new opener. I'm going to use that. That is, so I'm in this

140
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,640
day one more time. That was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass than the next generation

141
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,280
radio content in my ears. I like to think I'm flying into the future.

142
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,880
I'm just kidding. It's Adam Curry.

143
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,480
Ah, that is so awesome. That is great. Hold on a second. Let me put that up, uh,

144
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,720
the top of my outline as a part of my opening sequence. Fantastic. Love that. Thank you very

145
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,840
much. That's cool. That's what's so great about this is, you know, podcasting is one thing,

146
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:35,800
but how we are able to, you know, remix and rehash and mash up all the stuff we're doing

147
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,960
amongst each other is just an amazing amount of creativity. Speaking of which,

148
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,720
I've talked about Father Roderick, who is the Catholic insider, the Catholic priest from the

149
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,040
Netherlands who has been doing podcasts and sound seeing tours of the Vatican. He's gotten Vatican

150
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,640
radio to podcasts. And this guy is a total pioneer. It's great to listen to what he's doing.

151
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,040
And he has a new, I don't know if it was my, my iPod or what happened, but I guess I hadn't

152
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,680
caught a few episodes or maybe he just doesn't do him as regularly as he was when when the Pope

153
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:16,360
first fell ill. He recorded some beautiful choir in the Vatican. I've just blown away by that

154
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,080
and the quality is really beautiful. But he also has a feature on this show which tickled me. I'm not

155
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,320
going to play the whole thing, but just the the imaging of it, the sound staging and the topic

156
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:34,680
itself. Last year when I actually, I think I reviewed Dan Brown's Da Vinci code on the source code,

157
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,600
probably played played a little bit of the audio book, which is the way I quote Reddit and I really

158
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,720
enjoyed it immensely. I love the voices and yeah, it was just it was a fun listen, totally all in the

159
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,000
car, of course. And this is a very touchy and very controversial topic and what's taking place

160
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,120
now is that the church is, the Catholic church has taken to heart mission to debunk some of the

161
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,920
myths that are portrayed in this book, because and I have to agree with them there, just like the

162
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,000
Eric Rice story, you know, not Eric Rice story, but the mad story with Da Winner and I, before

163
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:19,560
you know, it that becomes like a lore and it's no possibly not true, right? So the new feature here

164
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:29,160
on the Catholic insider which I really love check it out. Investigating the Da Vinci code,

165
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,920
facts and fiction.

166
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,520
And it's time to look at some of the claims of the Da Vinci code that I mentioned in the

167
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:52,440
previous edition of the Da Vinci code investigation. And remember the reason why I think it's

168
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:59,240
important to separate fact from fiction is that Da and Brown continuously claims that his book,

169
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,040
although fictional, is based on historical facts and a lot of Christians and non-fiction believes

170
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,120
even some of you wrote me that after reading the book they didn't know what to think anymore about their

171
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,920
faith. The claims in the Da Vinci code go against some of the core beliefs of the Catholic church.

172
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,600
But is done Brown indeed using historical facts? Let's look at the first three claims.

173
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,480
Claim number one, the nightstumper existed. This is a fact.

174
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:41,880
Claim number two, according to the Da Vinci code English poet Alexander Pope spoke at

175
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:49,320
Isaac Newton's funeral. This is incorrect. Pope just wrote the epita that appeared

176
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,520
on a monument to Newton in West Minster Abbey erected years after his burial.

177
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,040
So you definitely should listen to that. It's a continuing episodic feature on the Catholic

178
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:08,520
insider, Catholic Insider.com. Very, very interesting. Of course it's, you know, just for Father

179
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,560
Roder to say true or false. It doesn't really give him any more credit than Da and Brown. But he

180
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,840
has some facts to back it up in some scripture and some writings. But on the end, you know,

181
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:27,000
even if Michael Jackson is actually a quitted of all claims he'll be that, you know, child molester.

182
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,880
That's just kind of the way folk lore goes. Looking into G-Bag, G-Mail,

183
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:41,880
um, interesting comments. Hold on, now I'm trying to, I'm trying to open up the comments themselves.

184
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,400
There we go. Let's see, this was, it's an email about Christina. Oh yeah, from David Banks and

185
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,000
Hi, listen to your tale of Browning Christina. This is the whole thing about her mouthing off and

186
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,520
having lack of respect for stuff and other people stuff and I didn't let her go to the good

187
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,240
Charlotte concert, which she'd been planning for three quarters of a year. She said, like a thank you,

188
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,880
David says, like the thank you for setting a good parenting example. I've got a 12-year-old boy

189
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,120
and it's difficult to raise kids nowadays, so many parents seem to feel that they have to be their

190
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,240
kids best friends instead of being a parent and setting limits. Hard to do throughout the years,

191
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,760
but it sounds like you are raising a great kid. Hopefully, when she's 20 years social,

192
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,240
appreciate it. Thank you, David. Banks and thanks David. A great email. Yeah, you know, we don't

193
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,800
talk about that enough, really, I guess, about parenting. You know, the one thing you learn

194
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,200
when you're first starting off in computing is read the fucking manual and of course,

195
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,160
you know, there is no, there is no stank in manual, which makes it that much more interesting.

196
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Speaking of that concert, a good Charlotte concert that Christina did not get to go to,

197
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,760
that was at Bricks in Academy. Derek Peters pointed out that there was a shooting at the

198
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,440
NAS concert at Bricks in the Academy that the day after we were there, she says, yeah, I know

199
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,480
it was a different show from good Charlotte took place after it, but it might make it a bit

200
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,480
easier for your daughter to get over not going to Bricks than it can be pretty rough. It has

201
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,120
pretty amazing gunfire and mid-performance at the NAS concert in Bricks in Academy. It's

202
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,400
what is the world coming to? The cops don't even have guns hardly in the UK, but NAS's fans do.

203
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:23,240
Got a lot of email from people about acid. Yesterday, I sent out a request for explanation.

204
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,360
Basically, it's a popular looping and music editing software from Sony, says Michael Ridley.

205
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,400
DJ Danger Mouse used it to produce the now infamous Jay-Z Beatles Grey album,

206
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,760
but does not have the ability to do what was described. This was Michael who

207
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:51,000
excuse me, damn, since so. This is Michael who came up with I think is an ingenious idea to

208
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,920
send control files out for mashups instead of the mashup themselves so that your computer essentially

209
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,560
will assemble the mashup because you presumably have the files necessary to create it and then the

210
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,120
mashup, you just get those control files and your computer, yeah, it basically does all the

211
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,640
mixing for you, which I think is a great idea. You know, this is somehow I can't get the control buttons

212
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:27,320
to work properly on VNC. I'm trying to open up, there we go, trying to open up different nodes

213
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:35,160
here in the outliner. Another email, let me see from Michael Oster, in your 321 source code you mentioned,

214
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,640
wanting to know if others are using the I-river with an external mic, yeah, that I did ask about that,

215
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,200
because I'm basically using my receiver of the wireless mic set as a kind of a preamp,

216
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,880
which explains a lot of the great sound. Michael says, I just got the I-river 899, which is best

217
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,520
by his version. Same as the 7-in, 99, and the same price too. Okay, hooked up a set of stealth microphones,

218
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,880
which are installed in a common headphones set. I record stereo through an 20 kilobits per second.

219
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,280
Sound is really nice, especially for sound-seeing tours, completely stealth, and he has a couple of

220
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,880
links there where you can check that out. Michael Oster, and of course you can read about all that

221
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,040
in the show notes for today. And then finally, this thing that got a lot of press over here

222
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:23,080
in the UK, the day it came out, but then it almost went away overnight. The PSP, the PlayStation

223
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,280
portable, if you've been hearing about this, this is, it sounds like it's an interesting device,

224
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,920
because a couple of people sent me a link to information about it. Yunky Dunk, from Gamers Radio

225
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,280
podcast, sent me some information. I see about the PSP portable video device, perfect for

226
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,760
my podcast, he says, because it's designed to be a portable gaming system, but you can also use

227
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,760
it as a portable audio or video player. This will allow for video gamers to listen to the audio

228
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,800
podcast and watch the video podcast between games that are on them when they're on the go. Right.

229
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,400
So we're doing anything but concentrating on being on the go. The PSP releases Thursday the 24th

230
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,280
in the US and has been delayed for Europe until the summer. Okay. And he has a couple links in there

231
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,000
as well. So I guess the big question is, can you record with it? Because that's what I'm still

232
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,720
looking for. And I think the I River, I got to tell you the I River really has a lot of machines

233
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,160
beat so far in the MP3 space. I mean, all the recording options they have just fantastic. It can

234
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,080
also record regular FM radio, you know, which there's still a lot of value to that. But yeah,

235
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,120
it's a great device. It is, it truly is a one and all and it's quick. If you just want to

236
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,880
listen to some stuff and you don't want to deal with playlists and just want to jam something onto

237
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,960
it. Boom, you know, it's on and it's basically in a file system so it's easy to understand where you can

238
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,480
find stuff. And there's more information on curry.com. Oh, blatant commercial plug, there's a link

239
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,440
there. I'm an Amazon associate. So if you buy one, I get a little hit from that and it's much appreciated

240
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,080
because it just proves that, you know, we can like make money with podcasting.

241
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Hi, Adam. This is another hit this. I am very fresh for time. So we're going to do it

242
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:27,000
very quick. Number one. I want to say Scruti Politi and Absolute, but I'm not sure. This is number two.

243
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,000
I know this one. I know this one. Is it sheena eastern? You've got the look?

244
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:49,080
I think it is. Yeah, I think it's sheena eastern. You've got the look. Pretty sure I got that one.

245
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,600
And the final one. Number three.

246
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,840
Nope. I got a pass on that one. I'm sorry, young. Times up. This is answer number one.

247
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:15,240
It's senderfold. I'm a trader. Oh, man, senderfold. Another fine Dutch trio.

248
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:31,720
Okay. It was guys also produced some of Patricia's hits. You can tell it's the same kind of

249
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,520
actually it produced this band after they did Patricia's stuff. Remember,

250
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,920
flysmart for time. We're talking about on the VPP podcast.

251
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,320
Number two. In today's hit test.

252
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,200
It's Prince. Who's got the look? Why do I think it was sheena eastern? I know. Damn. I know

253
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,760
the Prince wrote it, but I'm just an idiot. And now I saw like a real

254
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,200
door. Oh, she's sang on it. There you go. She's singing with it. That's it.

255
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,840
Remember?

256
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,480
Prince and who's got the look? Number two in today's hit test.

257
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,320
Oh, no way. Was that for her?

258
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,520
Oh, a tough clue, man. And this is answer number three. For her, say you will.

259
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,680
I can't sleep. I can't dream in a blue blue blue blue hit deal.

260
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,920
Make up your mind to now.

261
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,720
Oh, that voice. Whoo champ.

262
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,400
You want me again.

263
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,400
The third and final answer in today's hit test, foreigner and say you will.

264
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Well, I really got to go.

265
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,400
So, let me say very quick that you can send your feedback to hittestingmail.com

266
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,400
and the only information about this hittestin hittest podcast

267
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,400
can be found at jompolet.nl, this JNPL80.nl.

268
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Well, Adam, see you in a couple of days for next hit test.

269
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,400
I think after the Easter holiday, so see you later, bye-bye.

270
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Thank you very much once again, great songs.

271
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Just like now, I feel like I got to run over to my iTunes music store

272
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
and go buy some foreigner tracks.

273
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm pretty amazed by the experience I have to say of iTunes music store.

274
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
It really is pretty damn cool.

275
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I mean, you can't have better show prep.

276
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,400
It will be so easy for these guys to license it for extra money.

277
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,400
You know, we could totally come up with a fee for that.

278
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,400
You know, just make a podcast button and then, you know, that would be it.

279
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
It would be, oh, man, I would love that so much.

280
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Okay.

281
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,400
By the way, Jan, how did a young one over and look at some of the grandmaster view screens

282
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
to company have an investment in.

283
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
And he was looking for something very specific.

284
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
You should let us know how that is, Jan.

285
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Make some commercial noise here for a little bit of my companies.

286
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,400
It's turning into the real commercial show, isn't it? Oh, my goodness.

287
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Aviation talk.

288
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
As if we haven't had enough geek stuff.

289
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Now it's aviation stuff.

290
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,400
So the concept of sound seeing tours and aircraft is great.

291
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
I love it.

292
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
I'd love to hear some other types of aircraft.

293
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,400
If you're pilot, send a send me a link to your podcast where you, you're in the cockpit.

294
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
I used to love that by the way.

295
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
I think it's Delta United Airlines.

296
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I used to have Channel 7 from the flight deck.

297
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,400
And unless the captain turned it off, which some of them did by the way,

298
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
you could essentially listen in.

299
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,400
And I remember one time being at Newark, flight to San Francisco.

300
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
And it was one of those days when Newark was backed up.

301
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Three hour delays.

302
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Finally got on the plane.

303
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,400
And you know, as a taxi was just, well, that knows the tail literally.

304
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,400
So at least another hour just getting out to the taxiway to get to a runway.

305
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,400
And I was listening to the cockpit and the tower was, you know,

306
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,400
well, ground actually ground control was actually going pretty bizarre.

307
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Just trying to figure out who was who, and I remember saying, like,

308
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
United 65.

309
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
He just flash your lights.

310
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
So I can see if that's you.

311
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
And that was my first clue as before.

312
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
I was a pilot.

313
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,400
My first clue that not everything is as controlled as you'd want it to be in aviation.

314
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,400
But you know, it's a lot of really hardworking people who don't get paid a lot of money

315
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:59,400
by the way, pilots or other staff, other aviation workers.

316
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
There's not a lot of money in it.

317
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Some people make a lot of money from it.

318
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
But in it it's very hard.

319
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:12,400
You may not think that often about what goes on in the control tower.

320
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
But there's a lot happening there as well.

321
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
It's, you know, it's been very glorified by television.

322
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
But, you know, there's a lot to be done.

323
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
You know, there's weather updates.

324
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,400
There's basically making sure planes don't bump into each other on their approach, helping them out,

325
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
helping them in, making sure they see the airfield.

326
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I mean, it's a lot less automatic than you think it is, or then you've been led to believe that it may be.

327
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,400
I mean, there's people, very skilled people who do this, who transport you from one place to the other.

328
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,400
And after the aviation podcast in the past couple of days,

329
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Misha Masjar, I hope, pronounced that kind of close, who has Misha's minute podcast,

330
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
sent in his most recent one.

331
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
And it was just enthralling.

332
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
I couldn't stop listening to this.

333
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,400
This is the Mike has been a podcast for March 20th, 2005.

334
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
5 star 122.

335
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Congratulations, visual approach from way 25.

336
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Clear to land runway 25 remain this frequency.

337
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,400
1, 2, 9, or 0, at 9, or 0, at 9, or 0.

338
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,400
How's everybody doing this evening?

339
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,400
This is the tower admission of the Mike's minute podcast.

340
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,400
And right now, we're looking everything compliant over the tower.

341
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Right hour tower, everything.

342
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,400
One person showed the student, which is our standard practice on Friday Saturday.

343
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
We're going to be a gigare.

344
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,400
I've been for 4,55 here at Charlie's, that you want 11,000.

345
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Here are 45 five stars.

346
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Charlie Toledo, approach out, 103, 0, 11,

347
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
103,000.

348
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Expect the visual approach runway 25.

349
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
3,000 is 25.

350
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,400
So the frightening thing is actually understand exactly what he's saying there.

351
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
But it's great.

352
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,400
And in between talking to different aircraft as they're on their approach and he's helping

353
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,400
him get into the airfield, helping the metacopter get out and assisting them with the in flight

354
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,400
change of flight plan.

355
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
He's doing the podcast.

356
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
It's amazing to listen to this.

357
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Even if you're not interested in aviation,

358
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
it's good to know how that works.

359
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
It's funny because at a certain point,

360
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
I don't have it cut up.

361
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,400
There's an American eagle flight that's coming in.

362
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
And this is, so this is how you'll love this.

363
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
The American eagle flight says,

364
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,400
you know, hey, we didn't really burn off all of our taxi fuel,

365
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
wherever they're left from.

366
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Because this is all calculated right down to the gallon.

367
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
You know, they know or pounders, they say.

368
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,400
They know exactly how much fuel they need for each flight.

369
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Because if you know, the more fuel you have, the heavier you're going to be.

370
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
The less efficient you're going to be flying.

371
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
I mean, this is all.

372
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Aviation is a total spreadsheet business.

373
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
So I guess they didn't, you know,

374
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,400
they overestimated the amount of taxing fuel.

375
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,400
The fuel they need for taxing at their departure airport and whatever they need at the,

376
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
at the airport of arrival.

377
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
And so the pilot says,

378
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
you know,

379
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
we didn't burn off all our fuel.

380
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
So could you give us a, like a long final,

381
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,400
which basically means instead of coming to the airfield,

382
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
you know, hang in a, a right,

383
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
in this case, a right turn,

384
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
and then another right to land.

385
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
He would get it like a 10 or a 15 mile final.

386
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
So you'll be all the way out, 10,

387
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
15 miles,

388
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,400
and then you can just burn off some excess fuel straight into the airport.

389
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
It's funny, you know,

390
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,400
they could have also opted to have given everybody a little refund on the way out, I guess, but.

391
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,400
And that also, by the way,

392
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,400
is not just for the purposes of finances,

393
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
but I think actually in this case,

394
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,400
they were pretty much up to their maximum weight.

395
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
So, you know,

396
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
when you load passengers on and baggage,

397
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
and then you've got your,

398
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
your fuel,

399
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
no, that way is something.

400
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,400
And you expect that to diminish after X amount of time.

401
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
And they were very close to the maximum landing weight.

402
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Probably for the length of the field,

403
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
they were landing at.

404
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
So just to burn off a little of that,

405
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
we'll give them a little more margin,

406
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
a little more safety margin there.

407
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
So that's really what that was about,

408
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,400
but it's just funny to hear how all that works.

409
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
This is the daily source code,

410
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,400
in case you'd forgotten and tuned out and came back.

411
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
And of course, you had to start

412
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
all over again at the beginning,

413
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
because the iPod won't bookmark anything,

414
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
and MP3 files are hard to bookmark.

415
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Except, by the way,

416
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
did I tell you that on the creative labs,

417
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,400
the one I got it in Redmond,

418
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
it bookmarks.

419
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,400
You can actually bookmark an MP3 file, which is very cool.

420
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
And here's Pete,

421
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
our buddy, Raster Web,

422
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
the more sound sings the web audio,

423
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,400
more of 2005, low 3, 23.

424
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Well, if you heard our last podcast,

425
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,400
we did a, we tried to do a mobile podcast.

426
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I don't know how it worked.

427
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
You know, what it was, it's retarded.

428
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I had to kind of yell,

429
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
because I don't have a portal recording device,

430
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,400
but I've got some new equipment today.

431
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
And I think this will actually work a little better.

432
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Check out Pete's equipment.

433
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm going to start right now.

434
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm going to have to run,

435
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
because I don't have a lot of time.

436
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Okay.

437
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
We're running upstairs.

438
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
One, one second.

439
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Let's go.

440
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Let's go.

441
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Okay.

442
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
We heard that last time.

443
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Here's the dining room.

444
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Where we got four chairs and stuff.

445
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
We have a,

446
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
sorry about that.

447
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
I like going.

448
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
We have a front door here.

449
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm going to close the door.

450
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
You can also hear what that sounds like.

451
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
We go over here.

452
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
There's the living room.

453
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Then the television here.

454
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Turn it on.

455
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Let's do it over here.

456
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Next slide's turn that off.

457
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,400
We'll probably get, probably get soon by the,

458
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I hear some of that.

459
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
The more stuff.

460
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,400
And there's a door right here.

461
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
I can hear it.

462
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Turn it on.

463
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Close the door.

464
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
It's another bathroom.

465
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Water.

466
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
We got water in this bathroom.

467
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
We got running water in the house.

468
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Still, so that's pretty good.

469
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Come on in.

470
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,400
And, you know, the bedroom.

471
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Where all the action happens.

472
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
My action there for you.

473
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
We're actually, mostly overnight.

474
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,400
So, sorry, let's go to the bottom again.

475
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
That's about it.

476
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
That's the rest of me.

477
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Don't sing normally, simply.

478
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,400
And back in the dying room.

479
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
There's, oh no.

480
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
There's, there's basically a turn.

481
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Looks like we've got a broken string though.

482
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
That really sucks.

483
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Okay.

484
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Well, hold on.

485
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
And we're going back down to the basement.

486
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Here we go.

487
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Okay.

488
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
I almost fell down the steps.

489
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
But it's okay.

490
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,400
And that concludes this sound saying tour.

491
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Thank you.

492
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
And good night.

493
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Figure dick.

494
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:40,400
But even, you know, it kind of backfires because even though it was done to the walkie-talkie,

495
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
I still immediately had a visual of your house.

496
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,400
You know, it was probably a combination of houses I've lived in or been in.

497
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
But I had a total visual.

498
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
You know, it's just, it's crazy.

499
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,400
It doesn't, the quality doesn't even matter all that much turns out.

500
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
You kind of get used to it too.

501
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,400
It's like you get used to AM radio after a while.

502
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,400
My favorite girls, the list of views, biddies have been doing the bitty cast for a while.

503
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
It's great.

504
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Like 15 minutes.

505
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
They're on the road.

506
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,400
They're all in four chicks with instruments in a hotel room.

507
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,400
And it's at bittycast.com as we can pick up the podcast.

508
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Bittiesforever.com is their website and web logging where you can buy their CD.

509
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Great music.

510
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:28,400
And of course, if you do a podcast and you're, and it's about a group about what you go through in a band.

511
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,400
And life on the road and life at home and life studying and life working to make ends meet.

512
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,400
And life about podcasting while doing all this in a podcast thing.

513
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,400
You know, you got to do your own theme song, you know?

514
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,400
But I'm written in the IQ who just can't say the name.

515
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,400
But believe me, it won't matter to you when you've learned to play the game.

516
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Sitting and snapping or singing along.

517
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Favorite bitty or favorite song as long as you like it.

518
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
It's okay with us.

519
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
And if you don't like it, get back on the bus.

520
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,400
And if you stay put, then your loss will be us.

521
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:20,400
We can only pray.

522
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Man, I love those girls.

523
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,400
The CBS bitties check out the bitty cast for sure.

524
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Another great episode to listen to.

525
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Let's see, what are we doing for now?

526
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
We're doing for time.

527
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Let me just check the trusty eye river.

528
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Beautiful 36 minutes just time for a final match for the day.

529
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Jimphew sent this in.

530
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,400
He says, hi, excuse this direct approach.

531
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Couple of guys that get your bootleg on.

532
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Said it might be an idea to send you links to tunes because you do a very popular podcast.

533
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,400
We're piled shirt here.

534
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
What does that mean?

535
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
We're piled shirt, piled shirt.

536
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
There you go.

537
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Here's our take on Ravelle's Bollero classic.

538
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,400
And the clapping song with Ursula 1000 in the engine room.

539
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
All right, trying to get up.

540
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Get those here, bud.

541
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Pump the never body.

542
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Clap the roll.

543
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Clap.

544
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Clap.

545
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Clap.

546
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Clap.

547
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Clap.

548
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Clap.

549
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Clap.

550
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Clap.

551
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Clap.

552
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Clap.

553
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Clap.

554
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Clap.

555
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Clap.

556
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Clap.

557
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Clap.

558
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Clap.

559
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Clap.

560
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Clap.

561
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Clap.

562
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Clap.

563
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Clap.

564
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Clap.

565
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Clap.

566
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Clap.

567
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Clap.

568
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Clap.

569
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Clap.

570
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Clap.

571
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Clap.

572
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Clap.

573
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Clap.

574
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Clap.

575
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Clap.

576
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Clap.

577
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Clap.

578
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Clap.

579
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Clap.

580
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Clap.

581
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Clap.

582
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Clap.

583
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Clap.

584
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Clap.

585
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Clap.

586
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Clap.

587
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Clap.

588
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Clap.

589
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Clap.

590
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,400
Clap.

591
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Clap.

592
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,400
I'll be so drunk, I guess I'm so drunk

593
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I'm not sure you can find me, I'll rob that guy

594
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:59,400
She's a friend of mine, she's a friend of mine

595
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,400
And that was the freaking end of it all

596
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,400
I was so drunk, I'm not sure you can find me, I'll rob that guy

597
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,400
I was the freaking end of it all.

598
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Oh man, what a bummer.

599
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Didn't quite get the whole thing.

600
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I don't want to be in this.

601
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Oh, it's all in the world.

602
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Kind of anti-climactic there.

603
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
All right.

604
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
That's it for your daily source code for Friday,

605
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
the 25th of March 2005.

606
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
One more day tomorrow we're at home.

607
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Helping the emulsives figure out the navigator at the car

608
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
so they can get the supermarket.

609
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,400
And then Sunday, we're off a vacation to the lovely South Beach, Florida.

610
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,400
The power of the door is close.

611
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Can't wait.

612
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Sunshine, pool, beach.

613
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
And my podcast.

614
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
F.E.3 player.

615
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
We got the sound scene here all night.

616
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
You know what?

617
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm going to go golfing.

618
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
When does somebody can whack them?

619
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Figure out how to freaking golf.

620
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
That's the sound scene to what we could do together.

621
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
All right.

622
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Comments item of curie.com.

623
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,400
We've become it on the weblog www.curie.com.

624
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Let me source code.com.

625
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
We can pick up the archives, the latest show,

626
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
and the podcast feed.

627
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I'll see you on Monday for sure.

628
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Everybody take care.

629
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Bye-bye.
