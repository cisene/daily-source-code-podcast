00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Daily source code, April 6th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,960
Yo DJ, are you doing mech radio?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
Your DJ has only just begun.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,600
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Do you need it?

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,440
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,200
We don't need not sticking crazy.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I guess it's about a curry.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,200
Hey, everybody, we're back at the cottage, how you doing?

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
Once again, it's the Daily Source code.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
And we're back on track.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
That's right.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,400
Coming to you from Surrey.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Guilford to be specific to Curry Cottage.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,800
This is your Daily Source code, April 6th, 2005.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
Oh, man.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,600
It's good to be back home.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,200
Well, do I miss that Miami sunshine?

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Of course, we were gone.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,800
It was beautiful weather here.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,400
You know, that's the way it always goes.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,600
My in-laws have been staying here, taking care of the critters.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,400
We still got two dogs, two cats, and all the difference

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,800
with the house and apartment, you know, you got to have someone

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
look after the house.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
That's all kinds of shit and happens.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
All by itself, actually.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,200
So we got in the this morning, landed around 6.30 a.m.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
stood in the immigration line for another hour or so, you know,

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,600
big planes, a couple of jumbo's come in.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
400 people was shot and takes a little while.

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
And that went straight to bed once he got home.

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,000
Man, I was completely wrecked.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,600
I've been jet lag before, but in this case,

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
we couldn't get the seats we wanted on the way back.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,200
So it was a little more cramped than that I'm used to.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
Certainly on a seven and a half hour flight

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,000
so I didn't get a wink of sleep.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was, yeah, I mean, usually I'm out like a light, you know,

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,600
once in fact the minute the engines hit and we're taken off,

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,000
that's usually when I fall asleep and I usually get about two or three hours

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
in that point.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I'm fresh now, time is 8.22.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is this Wednesday?

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If it's Wednesday, then this must be guilt for it, I think.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So I was thinking what I could do to get the show cranking,

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
get into the mood and went over to the iTunes Music Store,

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
purchased something that we could all share together.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was talking about music licensing again pretty soon.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We could get some interesting feedback

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
from the Harry Fox agency from Sound Exchange and from BMI.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Looks like everyone's just kind of looking to see what's going to happen,

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
who's going to go first.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And the meantime, this is the perfect song to get into the mood.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I actually never heard this intro part before.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm only, I guess, only played the single version.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But once you hear it kick in, you'll know it is a perfect song for the podcast.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Try to grow.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Do be brothers on your daily source code.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So come to the most limited time.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Have a round of savings.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Take a closer off the road.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Run as fast as possible.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Save up before the stage.

Run as fast as possible.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,240
Don't be brothers from the best of the doobie brothers live, that's why I never heard

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,880
that intro before.

125
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,840
That's a China Grove on daily source code for April 6, one day before, oh nice, fade out,

126
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,200
nice ending guys.

127
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,240
One day before Patricia's birthday, and I've been forbidden to tell you how old she

128
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
will become 56.

129
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,480
So we'll have a little celebration tomorrow.

130
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,640
It's so good to be back and have my own sound again, and be sitting in my office, and

131
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
yeah, it's good.

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,440
It's really, really nice to be back, and lots of stuff to do.

133
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm going back to New York on Monday, and do another blitz tour, let's see where we're

134
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,360
going to go.

135
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,280
It's New York, then we go to Minneapolis, then we go to Colorado, and then maybe all the

136
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,240
way out to the West Coast that kind of depends on a couple of things that got to happen.

137
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,280
So just a little time to turn around, I really want to get this Windows laptop working.

138
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,480
Man, I got a lot of comments about the last podcast, which is the one that I did with

139
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
the tablet.

140
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,480
First of all, no, Microsoft did not send me the goddamn tablet.

141
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,320
I bought that myself at the Comp USA, it was at Circuits City.

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,680
I thought I actually explained about that.

143
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,720
A lot of feedback, though, a lot of people sending me URLs for great applications.

144
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
I have to say that what I really enjoy about this tablet is the one note.

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,640
Microsoft Office, one note, whatever, note taking software.

146
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:40,480
That stuff is really cool, and if you wonder why I'm delving into the world of Windows,

147
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,720
it's not because I've given up the Mac, I mean, no way.

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,360
I think I actually said, I want the Mac for content, and I love using the tablet for communication,

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,080
for Skype and emails, stuff like that.

150
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,200
Gmail works great everywhere anyway.

151
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,840
Man, it's a great-tab Gmail on all your browsers.

152
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,560
It's finally a great solution for synchronizing email across multiple machines.

153
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,480
Well, that's like, I'm going to just move the microphone up a bit.

154
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:18,880
So the reason is that, let me see, is it 95% of the world uses Windows, and we're in a business

155
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
where people unavoidably use computers.

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,160
So we got to come up with some stuff that also works on Windows,

157
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,520
and Mac people, especially when it comes to recording podcasts.

158
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,200
I think we're really, yeah, we're pretty privileged.

159
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,440
I've learned a lot about how the sound system or subsystem, or the fuck you call it, on Windows

160
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
works, it's interesting because it's not really uniform.

161
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,520
Each sound card is different, which of course is why the Mac is so great, because it knows

162
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
about what kind of core audio it's using.

163
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
And Windows, that can differ from machine to machine.

164
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,360
And of course, different sound card that could be used.

165
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,480
So if you want to make a system call, they say the mic mixer, you know, it's not that cut and dry,

166
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,960
you have to kind of like ask the sound card what it's using.

167
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,280
And at least this is the way it was explained to me.

168
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,840
And there's some great software that I've been testing, which is kind of like an alpha stage.

169
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,600
And I'm going to try and use that tomorrow to create the podcast.

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,920
So beware, it could be another shitty experience, which has nothing to do with that software.

171
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,640
It has more to do with the settings of the sound card.

172
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:32,240
I think that somehow loudness was turned on and SLS wow DSP and all kinds of loudness filters,

173
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,800
not write it all, but it's very hard to tell, you know, if you don't have your own gears,

174
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,600
like now with the headphones that I'm used to using, just all my own stuff, you know,

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,880
the ambient noise, all of that I'll really be able to tell before it goes out what the sound of the

176
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,920
of the show is actually like. I got a sound scene tour, I'll just play a little bit of this sound

177
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:00,000
scene tour. It comes to us from Apple iBlog. It's actually, it's not really,

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,400
it's more like a virtual sound scene tour. This is sound scene tour of wipeout pure,

179
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,280
which I presume is a game. It was probably like a skateboard game or snowboarding game on the PSP

180
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,400
that's the PlayStation portable, which I thought was interesting, you know, you could definitely do

181
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,560
sound scene tours of software that way. You could, you know, lots of people record their screens

182
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,200
when they're playing Xbox or PlayStation or whatever. Maybe it would be fun if you know,

183
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,440
like Sims or maybe if you're into Doom or some of those, you know, shoot them up games and

184
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,840
you're, and you can record the audio with the participants as well. That could be interesting.

185
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,720
So I just want to play a little bit of it. It's not very, it's not really exciting,

186
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,240
but still, you know, I want to give it a chance there as an idea. And good old Kenster J,

187
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,360
we've talked about Ken before. Ken, of course, has done, was it too now?

188
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,600
We only done two MTV Chronicles. Man, we got to do another one. We keep trying to hook up

189
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
up with this, you know, eight or nine hours time difference sucks, basically. So I'll try and catch

190
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,000
him this weekend because it looks like flying is out. There's a huge storm front headed our way

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,560
in the wing commander already sent out smoke signals that he probably wasn't coming over to some

192
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,760
training here. Another we can't fly in an inclement weather, but you really can't learn anything

193
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,720
because you're, you know, too busy battling the forces of nature and not, you know, not really

194
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,680
don't have enough time to, to work on, yeah, concentrating on getting the playing down on the ground

195
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,440
or, you know, just all the, all the, all the different stuff, you know, it's, according to the wing

196
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,880
commander, you just don't learn that much. So I'll probably have time to find Ken when it's both

197
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,240
convenient for us to do another MTV Chronicles. In the meantime, if you've never heard it,

198
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,440
the Ken and Squip show has some interesting topics this week. Hello, I'm Kenster J. Please join

199
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Squip and I this week, because I have a god awful traffic accident, Squip undergoes painful oral surgery

200
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,240
and all sorts of famous people die. That's this week, only on the Ken and Squip show,

201
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:14,480
a dusting my brain.com, KSS. Oh man, poor Ken, that sucks so bad. He's, he is a, he is a real

202
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,560
car freak, as long as I've known him, and probably as far as long as he's been able to drive

203
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,920
over before that. And he's been in some interesting accidents. He does seem to attract them somehow.

204
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,520
Although he'll, of course, deny that and say it's been years since he's had any kind of fender

205
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,880
bender and it's never his fault, but I'll never forget a new jersey. Ken worked at our house for a while.

206
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,440
We had, we, the house was kind of redumbed, but the garage was still, you know, at the end of the

207
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,000
driveway was a stand-alone garage. It was kind of together, you know, it wasn't falling down. So

208
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,360
at the time we had, what do we had? We had a Rolls Roy Silver Shadow, two beautiful car,

209
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,400
bought it from the first owner. And so that was in there. And then, I thought, I'm not quite sure what

210
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,840
it was, but Ken was going to park his car or want to get something out of the, I think it was going

211
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,840
to park his, oh, he was parking his car in there. I think it was that the new, he had like a new

212
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,680
Camaro, maybe that's the one he totalled. So we got the got total, got T-bone. You got to listen to

213
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,680
Ken and Squip show to get the details. We had two doors and one door, you know, they're supposed to be

214
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,560
like roll up garage doors, right, that on a spring system, but it was really heavy,

215
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,680
wooden doors. And usually a park, the rolls on the right hand side, because you had to like push it

216
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,000
all the way up to the bumper for it to fit in the garage. But it was out for some reason. And that was

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,960
actually since that, you know, that door rarely opened. That was the broken one, you know, so I

218
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,040
just parked it there. And broken means the spring system didn't work. And clearly recall,

219
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,240
the Ken Park, this new car, you know, opened up the garage. Wanted to roll in and then

220
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,320
freaking door came down right on the hood. We last now, we come to think of it. We laugh then too.

221
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:04,480
My name is Dave. I'm a Mac guy. Is there an eye Mac on your desk? Is there a power book in your

222
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,760
bag? Is there an iPod in your pocket? Do you wonder what's up with those people who used that

223
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,720
other operating system? If so, you may be a Mac guy. Find out for sure by tuning into the

224
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:26,320
daily podcast from www.radiomacguys.com. I think I am. I think I, well, if not, I'm coming out of the closet

225
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,960
now. I'm a Mac guy. Sorry about that. I wanted to come home to to see the animals reaction.

226
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,200
Mac cats, you know, we got these two great cats. All of our animals come from shelters or

227
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,560
pounds or whatever around around the world. And cats are so weird, you know, you walk in and

228
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,560
look, kind of look at you for two seconds and look away like, you know, dude, where were you? Yeah.

229
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:55,120
Like they don't give a shit. So I guess news that quivered through the podcast community the

230
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,880
other day is Paris Hilton's podcast is forthcoming at starts on April 29th in promotion for the

231
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:11,680
movie House of Wax. Interesting responses to everybody or from lots of people about this.

232
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,200
And I'm thinking, you know, I was a fan of the simple life. When we were living in Belgium,

233
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,240
I was actually downloading the show by a bit torrent a year before the first series aired in

234
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,560
the Netherlands or in Belgium. And even though it's completely scripted, you know, I like Paris Hilton.

235
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,280
I think she's, I think she's something about her that's just, you know, it's just cute.

236
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,440
What else can you say? You know, you don't have to have, you don't have to necessarily be talented

237
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,240
to be cute and nice and likable. And, you know, this podcast is going to be interesting.

238
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:53,680
I had dream actually the other night about that. It was me, Paris, a hotel room. And for some

239
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,840
reason, Mads Weinstein. Everybody dreams of meeting industry influencers face to face.

240
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,920
So locker room is bringing a few of them to Seattle, Washington for the fifth annual known

241
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,120
decks, a conference for entrepreneurs, smart business executives and tech enthusiasts the world over.

242
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,200
Adam Curry is this year's keynote with a handful of internet leaders joining him in our

243
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,840
single track schedule. I'm Chris Parillo and I'll be your host for the entire weekend,

244
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,560
providing Wi-Fi, a dedicated power outlet in the main hall and unlimited food and beverages throughout

245
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,360
the day for all registered attendees. Swing by known decks.com for more information.

246
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,840
GNOMEDX.com. See in Seattle for June 23rd through 25th 2005.

247
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,200
All righty. Chris, you definitely need to listen to East Radio the most recent podcast

248
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,320
because for the fifth of April, I was listening to that on the plane and Mads who calls you

249
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,520
alternatively Chris Scott and James. You know, I think it's challenging you to a mud wrestle.

250
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,480
I'm not quite sure, but you should check it out. And also, I think Chris is trying to get

251
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,160
Dave Winer out there, which I hope he accepts the invitation. That would be great. So we could

252
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,840
have multiple sides of the podcasting coin and I look very much forward to that.

253
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,440
The Pew ratings is another thing that a lot of people have been talking about. P.E.W.

254
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,880
Let me just see, what does that stand for? Hold on a second. Of course, I'm ill-prepared for

255
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,560
this. Hold on. Let me just open up my browser. Again, I'm using the desktop Mac with a cinema display,

256
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,680
using VNC to control the laptop, which of course is connected to the board to the mixing board.

257
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,880
Let me see. Guess I could just look for this. I'll maybe just get it from my side. Hold on a second.

258
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:48,400
So these Pew people are essentially they do internet ratings, I guess. They're the ones

259
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,880
that have been tracking. I think the first time I heard of them was when they released a study

260
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,600
on how many people use RSS. Interestingly enough, no one challenged the RSS study.

261
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,720
But the podcasting study, because the numbers are pretty big. Six million people apparently have

262
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,560
listened to podcasts in the United States alone. That's big. Hold on, still. What is wrong here?

263
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:19,520
Oh, yeah, shoot. The four megabit line was down when I got home, which of course screwed up a

264
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,040
couple of things. I must have gone down two days ago because the in-laws couldn't use the Skype phone

265
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:30,320
to call us. I didn't know what the problem was, but I guess it's loading now. I guess it's because

266
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,280
about something went down for one reason of the other. So it's a support and email. Luckily we have

267
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,920
the backup DSL, which is a one megabit down. And what is it? 250, I'll present something like that.

268
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:49,920
So it's not blazingly fast, but it certainly works. I guess there's a way that I could link those

269
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,880
two together with some kind of router or a switch, I guess is what I need. An IP switch, and then

270
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
it would automatically switch over to, or maybe it would combine the bandwidth. I wonder if there's

271
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,160
an easy way to do that. If you have two dedicated lines coming in, if there's a simple setup or

272
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,160
do I have to get a switch, or can I just use a router? The interesting to find out. So here I am

273
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:18,000
Pew about us, who are these people? Basic information about a mission staff advisory board

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,800
of privacy reprint and citation policies. What does that mean? Oh, mission. Okay, here we go.

275
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,400
Who are these people from Pew? We want to know our mission. The Pew, I want to put Pew

276
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,920
stands for Pew. Who came up with that name? The Pew Internet and American Life Project produces reports

277
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,680
that explore the impact of the internet on family communities working home, daily life,

278
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,600
education, health care, and civic and political life. The project aims to be an authoritative

279
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,560
source on the evolution of the internet through collection of data and analysis of real world

280
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,720
developments as they affect the virtual world, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, so, oh, they have RSS feeds.

281
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,600
Oh, no, I'm going to check kind of RSS feeds. They have, oh, okay. Oh, I definitely need to get that.

282
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,320
They've got RSS feeds for just for the front page, for reports, for the press releases,

283
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:16,160
or for all them great. Oh, subscribe to that for sure. So the big noises, this is impossible.

284
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,520
Six million people. How can it be? And they had, they took such a small sampling.

285
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,920
200-nate people. So that means there's a margin of error of 7.8 percent. Okay, so that's like,

286
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,680
I'll say 10 percent. That means it could be, they could be off by 600,000. So it's 504,

287
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,520
the 5,400,000 people. And that's still a hell of a lot. And by the way,

288
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,760
who said that's wrong? You know, what's wrong with the statistical sample like that?

289
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,320
This is exactly how ratings have been done for years. Sure, they've got people meters,

290
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,280
but it's still a sample of like, I don't know, what, I know what it is in, in some countries,

291
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,480
it's like 2,000 people. But I'm not sure what the sampling is in the states and companies

292
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:10,000
are increasingly more using people meters. But for radio, for instance, it's diaries. You actually

293
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,320
fill out a little booklet and tell the arbitron people what you listen to. If you write down the

294
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,360
name of a DJ that you remembered, which could be like, Bubba the love sponge, not like we haven't

295
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,680
heard that on 50 million stations. You know, the station will actually get a credit for that in the

296
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:33,040
ratings. And then, you know, the extrapolation, it's a great word, the extrapolation of these numbers

297
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,760
is boiled down to Q and, you know, average time spent listening. I mean, it's all kinds of ways.

298
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,400
And all that it's, that that's about is about sales. This is the most powerful sales tool in

299
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,840
really in the commercial world, as we know it today. And no one questions this shit. I think we've

300
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,280
talked about it before that, you know, when you do, well, I've talked a lot of statisticians,

301
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,080
because I've been in television, certainly. And I know that just from the response from people

302
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,920
on the street that sometimes we got a shitty rating, I know that lots of people watched it and

303
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,400
really liked it. And it was, you know, the topic of the day. So, you know, I guess sometimes just

304
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,960
fall into a hole there when it comes to, you know, pure mathematical statistics. And all the

305
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,680
mathematicians tell me that statistics really do work. You know, you, you can fight it. But

306
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,920
I mean, I'm, I'm not a mathematician. I can't fight it with them. So, I'll just have to take

307
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,920
their word for it. The people, I respect for their knowledge. So, you know, how can we be questioning

308
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,200
this and not be questioning ratings? Because it worked. What was that movie? Was there a movie with

309
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,080
who is with the, I'll come on. What's the, what's the little good fellow guy's name?

310
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:55,520
Ugh. I can't, I can't cope with this name. Anyway, it was like some gangsters and I can't,

311
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,640
why am I bowing on the title of this movie? It's like a movie you see on cinimax. Anyway,

312
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,680
gangsters come up with a TV show or there's a TV show and then the gangsters go and basically

313
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,920
hijack everybody's home who is a, a Nielsenho and they keep reporting that they're watching

314
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,840
that show. And so it's sourced at the top of the ratings. Boy, I wish I could, that's horrible.

315
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:29,600
Okay, it must be the jet lag. I'm just totally phasing out on what that was. So, you know, no matter

316
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:37,200
which way you look at it, statistics do work. So, if, I think, I mean, I have a hard time believing

317
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,520
it myself, you know, 200 and eight people that you can come up with a number like six million.

318
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,840
But, you know, if we don't question all the other statistics that we live with, you know,

319
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,520
okay, so five million, 400,000, that's still the hell of a lot. So there's something really

320
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,520
something going on here. And I quite frankly, I find it very exciting. And by the way, when it comes

321
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:05,360
to statistics, have we ever really gotten over, you know, the fuzziness of stats and unique

322
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,960
visitors and paid views. I was reading in the Wall Street Journal on the plane. I should have torn

323
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,160
in the article out. I didn't bring it with me. There's a lawsuit right now that's been filed

324
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,400
against Google. And I think Yahoo, by one, or I don't know if it was a class action, it was one

325
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,000
of more advertisers who say, hey, you know, your numbers are fucked up. The fraudulent. And we're

326
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,960
paying you too much. And in fact, I think the, and I'd love to hear from some lawyers out there,

327
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I think the case actually states that Google and Yahoo concealed the fact that these

328
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,160
advertisers were actually receiving less legitimate traffic than that they were paying for. So

329
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,280
something to keep our eye on.

330
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:57,760
This is an invitation to all the Mac OS 10 users in the audience to surf over to podcasttuner.com

331
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:05,520
and check out a brand new podcasting client for the Mac. Like you, I love free software. But I hate

332
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,160
free software that crashes every time I run it on OS 10 like I Potter. I also don't like paying

333
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:19,920
$20 for software with a hideous interface like I Potter X. With podcasttuner, you get a podcasting

334
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,800
client designed from the ground up. Now, you know, I was, I played this promo because I want to

335
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,760
give equal airtime to all different podcasting clients out there. I promoted, I was at blog matrix

336
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,800
sparks the other day. Actually, that's on my weblog. But, you know, why would you put out a promo?

337
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,480
And in your promo, you start slagging your competitors that really says a lot about you did to run

338
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,200
fast and stable on OS 10. And podcasttuner does things no other podcasting client does.

339
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,720
Podcasttuner displays show notes without launching a web browser and it can send those show notes

340
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,720
to the note reader of your iPod so you can read them on the go whenever you happen to be listening

341
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,280
to your podcasts. But please don't try that while you're driving. Podcasttuner integrates

342
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,400
seamlessly with iTunes or not. If you'd rather not use iTunes at all, you can listen to your podcasts

343
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:27,360
right in podcasttuner. And podcasttuner costs only a fraction the price of iPod X. A single user

344
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,960
license for podcasttuner is only five dollars. So if you have a Mac and you're searching for

345
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,400
a better podcasting client, surf over to podcasttuner.com.

346
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,440
Okay. All right, there you go. Actually, download the House of Wax private label branded iPodder.

347
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,200
A little bit of a cold didn't want you to hear that. And I downloaded that onto the Windows machine.

348
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,600
It's cool. It's got all the House of Wax branding on it. Congratulations to the lemon team. That's a

349
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:17,520
great, great job guys. And it's also cool to see the directories in there and the podcast

350
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,520
Alie Top 10. And so it's really, it'll give people an entree.

351
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,400
Damn airplane air. It'll give people a real insight into the community. You know, not just,

352
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,560
oh, here's the Paris Hilton podcast. And what really slays me is that something that's been

353
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:46,080
in there since day one of the iPodder clients is the the welcoming message, the welcome message. I love

354
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,640
the fact that left in there. I really appreciate that. That's a way cool. So tomorrow or Friday,

355
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,320
I'm not quite sure which one's going to work time wise. Ron and I are going to do another

356
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,080
another, I don't know if we'll do a full show together or if I'll bring him into the source code.

357
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,880
I'd like to do a full show with him. He's now set up, he's got his setup ready to go at home. And he has

358
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,000
a full blown studio, being a musician and he's built a couple of studios. He has all this gear

359
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,160
left. We still went out shopping at guitar, center, guitar, world, guitar universe, whatever it is.

360
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,240
I've got himself a mixer, compressor. He's got some beautiful microphone, like a noise and microphone.

361
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,600
And we worked on setting up the routing so that's Skype will work. And so we're ready to make some

362
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,960
damn announcements. I'd say the first announcement we're going to make. I will be our strategy. So

363
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,840
be on the lookout for that this week. And as I said, next week will be together for the whole week. So

364
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,160
more coming very soon. And as I got home, all the news here was about Michael Jackson.

365
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,800
You know, now they've allowed this testimony by other kids who say that they've been

366
00:28:51,600 --> 00:29:00,800
molested by Michael. Of course, their parents receive $20,000 to sell their story on hard copy.

367
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,160
Their lawyers are going to press civil charges if I guess if they can or how that works.

368
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,880
And you know, it was a tickling game, but you know, then a tickling game that maybe went too far.

369
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
I mean, I hate having to discuss this story. But I just want to reiterate,

370
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:24,320
innocent until proven guilty. I've met this man. He's asexual. I think he just loves all children of the

371
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,280
world. If I'm wrong, I'll be the first guy to say, dude, I was fucking wrong. But I'm glad we have the

372
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,000
process to make sure that we're right or wrong. And I do believe in the American justice system.

373
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,080
I fucking don't believe in the American media system because, you know, it's just like,

374
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,440
you know, well, okay, the Pope's dead. We're all tied to that story. Hey, let's do Michael Jackson again.

375
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,280
Yeah, this is this man is is half dead no matter what. It doesn't matter what the outcome of the

376
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:56,000
trial is. This, this will kill just a piece of him. That's what happens. It's when you're a

377
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,400
public figure and this kind of shit happens. And it doesn't have to be about child molestation

378
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,160
can be about anything. And it really hurts, particularly the way the media handles it. It's

379
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,120
assholes. All of you. Okay. Again, if I'm wrong, I'll be the first guy to stand up and say, you know,

380
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,720
totally misread it and misjudged it. And again, it's great. We have this process. But innocent until

381
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,080
proven guilty. Please.

382
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Oh, you go to sleep tonight. Oh, you please.

383
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Oh, you go to sleep tonight.

384
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Oh, you go to sleep tonight. Oh, you go to sleep tonight. Oh, you go to sleep tonight. Oh, you go to sleep tonight.

385
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:38,320
Oh, you go to sleep tonight. Hey.

386
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,320
You know, it's time

387
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,320
Through the wide mass down

388
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:59,320
The wide mass down

389
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Down

390
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,320
The woman suffered a rise in the wide awake

391
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
She woke with violence started at the side of the world

392
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,320
The two and a half day we were shocked

393
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
And since she was full of that activity

394
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Lashed in the battle with the great python

395
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
What an order was a blame

396
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
She woke her as soon as the sun

397
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Crucially flare around

398
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
The room had to be dark

399
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
And the candles lit

400
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
The windows tally shocked

401
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
She moved about naked with a cigarette tank

402
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
From the quarter of her mouth

403
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Her toilet was in the bear of the great preoccupation

404
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,320
A thousand trifling females had to be a tent

405
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,320
Before she could so much as dawn and bathroom

406
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,320
She was like an athlete hearing for a great amount of time

407
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,320
My hands start to rust

408
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,320
The hours turn

409
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,320
And to dust like on top of the refrigerator

410
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,320
Indeed

411
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Does an understand

412
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,320
A smile?

413
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:27,320
In the palm of His hand

414
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough.

415
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:56,220
Don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough, don't stop to get enough.

416
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:25,220
Okay, that's different, say a prayer for Michael Jackson, that's sent in by, hold on a second, my screen is updating here, that's sent in by, there's hypno-love wheel.

417
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:33,220
You know, love wheel, say a prayer for Michael Jackson, that's different, sure, but you might as well.

418
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,220
Hey, Han, you want to do the hit test?

419
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,220
Well, you know, what do you mean by the hit test?

420
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,220
Does she want to do the hit test?

421
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,220
Yeah, hold on a second, no, no, Han, come on.

422
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,220
She's unpacking the suitcases.

423
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
I love it when she does that.

424
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,220
The automatic packing and unpacking suitcases.

425
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,220
Do you want to do the hit test with me?

426
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,220
Yeah, the young pull-out hit test?

427
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
Yeah.

428
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,220
Yeah, well, I'm recording right now, so, yeah, come over here.

429
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,220
You can have one, you can have one headphone.

430
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,220
I didn't say anything, very dirty.

431
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,220
Right, hold on a second, let me put it in the other ear, okay.

432
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,220
All right, you ready?

433
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
Okay, hold on a second, here we go.

434
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
Yeah, hold on a second.

435
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,220
Ready, two, one.

436
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
It's time for the hit test.

437
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,220
With young pull-out, not for me.

438
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:33,220
Hey, Adam, this is a hit test made in advance, because probably I'm not available at the moment.

439
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,220
Okay.

440
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,220
If you want to know more about this, check out the hit test podcast.

441
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,220
It should be available right now.

442
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,220
All right, so I don't know what's happening right now, but I have a hit test.

443
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,220
So here's number one.

444
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Here we go.

445
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,220
One, two, one, that is.

446
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,220
One, two, one, that is.

447
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
One, two, one, that is.

448
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,220
It's, uh, came here.

449
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
And this is number two.

450
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Two.

451
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,220
Two.

452
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
Two.

453
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
Two.

454
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
Two.

455
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,220
Two.

456
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,220
Two.

457
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,220
Two.

458
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,220
Two.

459
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,220
Two.

460
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,220
No, it's not what we got.

461
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,220
Well, thank you.

462
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
There's nothing like no one.

463
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,220
Number three.

464
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,220
Huh?

465
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,220
I don't know what that is.

466
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
All right.

467
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
Uh, it's hard also.

468
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Sometimes I'm happy.

469
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,220
This is answer number one.

470
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Okay, let's came here.

471
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,220
It's came here and word up.

472
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,220
Remember what the guy was wearing,

473
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
from.

474
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,220
He's at, like.

475
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,220
In a red, jux swell.

476
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,220
Teacheroning still down.

477
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,220
Okay, let's go.

478
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,220
Let's go.

479
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,220
Ain't make fification..

480
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,220
Same.

481
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,220
When you hit the car you've got to get it under government.

482
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,220
Get it under government.

483
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
It's the trollery.

484
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,220
normally no way you'd say

485
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,220
Cario and word up.

486
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,220
10.

487
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,220
1.

488
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,220
This is number 2.

489
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
It's Rose Royce.

490
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,220
This is Best Love.

491
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
I am Best Love.

492
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,220
That's a good song.

493
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:52,220
And now Best Love.

494
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,220
Rose Royce.

495
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,220
And number 2.

496
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,220
This is Answer Number 3.

497
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,220
Oh.

498
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Shack Attack.

499
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,220
Shack Attack.

500
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,220
Shack Attack.

501
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,220
Shack Attack.

502
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,220
This song is titled, Don't Know This.

503
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
It's a little bit sweet.

504
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
It's a little bit sweet.

505
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,220
There's a whole philosophy behind it.

506
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:37,220
It's a little bit sweet.

507
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,220
Down Under Street.

508
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,220
Answer Number 3.

509
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
All music from the 80s.

510
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
Man, I love that music.

511
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,220
Well, and I hope you enjoyed this one.

512
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:52,220
Again, I don't know if I am able to create a hit test in the coming days.

513
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,220
Yes, because I'm not afraid of all.

514
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,220
Well, okay.

515
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,220
We'll just have to wait and see.

516
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,220
See you next time for another edition of the hit test.

517
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,220
Bye-bye.

518
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
Oh, very much.

519
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Feedback.

520
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,220
Welcome at hit test at gmail.com.

521
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,220
And check out the hit test podcast at youngvolet.nl.

522
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Bye-bye.

523
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,220
I don't know.

524
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,220
Let me see.

525
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,220
Let me look at his web blog.

526
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,220
I'm here.

527
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:29,220
I'm off for four days of observation and examination to determine the content of an 18 week rehabilitation

528
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,220
period that is handicapped related and that will be coming soon.

529
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,220
Oh, boy.

530
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,220
Yeah, he has a vision problem.

531
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,220
Oh, yeah.

532
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,220
So I hope he can, uh, I hope that works out.

533
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Yeah, we're trying to get him a grandmaster view screen.

534
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,220
A big one.

535
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,220
Yeah.

536
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:51,220
Yeah, because he's like, I think he's, uh, he's visually fucked up.

537
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
Yeah.

538
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Let me say.

539
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,220
Yeah.

540
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Like, see, here's a little picture of him.

541
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,220
Okay, young.

542
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Well, we hope everything's okay.

543
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,220
Looking new, sunny.

544
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Yeah.

545
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,220
Wait, let me zoom in for you.

546
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,220
Yeah.

547
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,220
Because I have a little bit of a vision problem.

548
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
But that's my age.

549
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Uh, he has a little, um, he has a business.

550
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
Yeah.

551
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,220
He goes out and fix people's computers and installs networks and shit.

552
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
So that's pretty cool.

553
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
He has a little, little car.

554
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
One of those little mini cars.

555
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Yeah.

556
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
Really?

557
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Yeah.

558
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Okay. Well, young.

559
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,220
We hope you, uh, we hope you do.

560
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Okay.

561
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Because, uh, Dan, what am I going to do without a hit test?

562
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
Oh, my God.

563
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Yeah.

564
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,220
Oh, my God.

565
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,220
That would be pretty.

566
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,220
Yeah.

567
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,220
Okay.

568
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,220
Thank you, honey.

569
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
I was fun.

570
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,220
Maybe it's a laser thing.

571
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
I hope so.

572
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
I hope it's something like that.

573
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,220
Yeah.

574
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,220
I hope it works.

575
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Definitely.

576
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,220
And let me see.

577
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,220
That'll just about do it for today's source code.

578
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
Yep.

579
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
41 minutes.

580
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Love it.

581
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220
April 6, 2005.

582
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,220
As always, feedback is welcome.

583
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,220
Adamaccurry.com.

584
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,220
And I have two gigs.

585
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,220
So you can fill that up.

586
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,220
For some reason, the MP3 feedback at gmail.com isn't working.

587
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,220
I don't know if it's filled up already or.

588
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,220
I gotta go see what's going on with that.

589
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,220
Because it should have double the space.

590
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,220
Everyone should be able to send at least.

591
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,220
Another problem when everyone already sent one in the past couple months.

592
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:08,220
Of course, www.curry.com for the weblog for comments.

593
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,220
And daily source code.com is where you can pick up the podcast feed.

594
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,220
Check out the archives and the most recent podcast.

595
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
I'll be back tomorrow from the cottage.

596
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,220
Take care.

597
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,220
Bye-bye.

598
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:38,220
Thanks for watching.
