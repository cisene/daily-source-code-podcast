1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
Delta Sierra Charlie 214 and good morning everybody. This is the daily source code

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,720
It's out. I'm curry coming to you from San Francisco. It is late

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,860
The time is a quarter to one. Actually, it's that's not even that late considering how late I've been

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,580
How late I've been up and working this living on all sides of the clock here

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,200
It's my last evening in San Francisco tomorrow. I return home

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,680
Back to Gilford back to Curry Cottage. Can't wait to see the girls again. And you know

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,120
I I decided for two reasons actually that I would just do another

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,720
Talking podcast and we'd roll out any music or anything. The main reason being that my microphone is almost out of juice

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,960
I had one extra reserve battery for the transmitter and

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,880
Didn't have one for the receiver now. I have a flashing red light which means it could be good for 30 minutes

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,320
It could be good for 15 minutes. I'm not quite sure. So if all of a sudden we just

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,040
Fizzle out. Well, then you'll know what happened and then you'll be hearing from me again on Wednesday when I'm back home

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,740
So I have lots of great things

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,000
Going on here lots of good news. I still can't give you

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,680
The full-dam announcement because what we just want announced things properly

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,200
But I can tell you that I got an apartment here in San Francisco because it's gonna be just like the oil rig

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,480
I think I talked to you about that

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,120
Yesterday on the San Francisco sound seeing tour of union square

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,160
I'll be it'll kind of you had to be like an oil rig, you know two three weeks off one week on and

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,880
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get a duplicate set up of gear at the apartment here in San Francisco

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,560
I guess we should give it a name

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, let me why don't we call it the curry condo. There you go

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,520
24th floor towering over the streets of San Francisco. I've got the

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,840
The movie view if you will the motion picture view. It's going to be awesome

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,120
So I'm gonna have a duplicate set up with you know with a real mic with a mic stand right now

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,880
I'm just kind of holding the love microphone in front of my face

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Which doesn't work too well

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,560
Particularly because I'm using my left hand and I think it was Madge Weinstein

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,320
We left a very appropriate comment on on the show notes the other day

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,680
She said DSC doesn't stand for Delta's share at Charlie or daily source code. It stands for daily shoulder complaint

31
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
so

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,720
Actually the shoulder is not what's bothering me. It's it's still my hand my fingers my

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,360
My index finger and my thumb of my left left hand

34
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,880
They just go numb

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Whenever there's too much

36
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,280
Yeah, whenever I've just done too much to my hand. I guess hey, it's the left hand, okay? All right

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
So I only use that for flying actually had dinner

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
The other night with some friends

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,800
One of the who's a neurologist a doctor and I had mentioned anything and then one of our tablemates said well, you know

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,240
Adam's had this issue with his with his hand and he immediately grabbed my my hand and

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,680
Exert some pressure on my wrist and he said it's carpal tunnel syndrome. I said it way to make it

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,600
You know, I've had all these people telling me that because of the nerve in the back of my

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,440
You know my shoulder blades that it's pinching off a nerve and he said yeah

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,880
Well, that's kind of what carpal tunnel syndrome is. I said oh, well

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,080
That's nice. Well, what kind of do about it? He said well you have to come to the office and we'll do five minutes of tests in the morning

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,320
I wanted you might have to have a splint on it or something like whoa, hold on a second

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
So I guess when I get back to to the cottage

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,520
I'll make an appointment with with the doctor and I'll go see if it's a carpal tunnel syndrome

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,400
It's it's not horrible, but whenever I do something

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,680
Whenever I yeah, it just depends on what position I'm holding my my hand in

51
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,760
But again, I've gotten so many emails from some from mainly pilots who who have this this particular issue

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
Also people who write motor cross

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,000
So I guess you know as you get older you just mess around with your body enough and shit starts to break and fall apart

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,160
And that's exactly what's starting to happen to me

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,360
But that cannot ruin my mood my friends because we have so much cool stuff going on

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,600
We're hiring people out here in San Francisco. That's all part of the damage

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,080
We'll be making because we've got an office that that we're going to be opening up here. I am

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,960
Really really really pumped because the East Coast guys are coming in town

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,720
We are bringing the new media the real public radio

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,640
We're bringing it to town. We're going to have a lot of fun. I can tell you that and of course

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,720
Being out in San Francisco means we have access to all kinds of great talent

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,840
Who can really start to help us on the technological front

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,240
Particularly with with bandwidth man. I've learned so much already about bandwidth my god

64
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,760
Let me tell you

65
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
bandwidth is not free okay

66
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,160
When once you get above a certain level and of course there are all kinds of different hosting solutions

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,280
Who claim to give you unlimited bandwidth and you can get unlimited bandwidth to an extent

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,360
But if you've got a podcast for instance if you're featured on the pod finder in iTunes

69
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,960
We actually offer hosting and feed management to anyone that we that we profile on the pod finder

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,120
If you haven't heard the pod finder by the way

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
The new one is being released today episode number three

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
You know, we have just

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,000
Thousands tens of thousands of people who want to go check out the show and subscribe to it and

74
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Well, either you'll run out of your bandwidth a lotment or your pipe will just be completely flooded. So it does you know

75
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
There is some cost to all of this and

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,320
What we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to figure out how to move people more towards subscribing to these podcasts instead of trying to get them

77
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,520
You know in real time otherwise, you know, we're gonna run into some real real issues here some real problems

78
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,240
This by the way is exactly what killed the streaming business now podcasting of course is very different in that

79
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,760
It's a mobile concept right you take it with you and you don't just let you don't have to listen to it

80
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,800
Locked into your computer but people are so enthralled by what's going on

81
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,120
They're loving these podcasts so much that you know in fact some people actually will fill in the date for the source code like today is

82
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,400
DSC-2005-07-26 and they'll just keep hitting refresh until the show comes online

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,760
But that was never really the concept and you know the concept was even if you have just a little bitty pipe and you know

84
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Almost no no real

85
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Speed of bandwidth at all

86
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
It doesn't matter because the podcast and you subscribe to it once it's available

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,480
It starts sucking it in slowly or fast whatever it is and then when it's in it, you know your iPodor or your pod catch or your iTunes will say

88
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,880
Oh, I've got a new show and that's when you play it

89
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,400
So we're gonna have to work on some of this stuff. Otherwise, you know, I can't mention any any

90
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,760
Shows anymore if I mentioned a podcast that doesn't have proper hosting

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,680
They're off the air, you know, and so that's that's a fucking bummer and everybody has to be able to participate. So

92
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
Excuse me

93
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,440
So working on all kinds of different strategies for that now I know that bit torrent would be a great solution

94
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
But you know

95
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,200
There is I don't think any way that that iTunes is going to integrate bit torrent for quite a while

96
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,440
And not that the engineers or the business people wouldn't want to do it and in fact

97
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,680
We discussed bit torrent very openly at Apple during this past trip

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,800
The big problem of course is Hollywood because the minute you say peer to peer Hollywood freaks out

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,000
You know, oh well peer to peer equals theft. That's basically what what Hollywood thinks so

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,680
We're gonna have to come up with some really smart ways to route around that issue and if it's up to us at Pod Show

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
We're going to

102
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,880
Definitely make sure that the small independent podcaster

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Has that bandwidth and you know you shouldn't have to you know you shouldn't have to pay an arm in a legboard if at all

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,920
You know and it does come down to money. This is not free stuff, you know

105
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,280
Especially now that we've got the listeners on the march the hundred million listener march. It's happening

106
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
They're on their way. They're coming

107
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,440
Excuse me. It's oh, hold on let me just have a sip of water

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Something stuck there

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,440
Once again a nice five dollar bottle of Fiji natural artisan water

110
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Bottled at the source

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,640
Let me see where was I what else did I want to talk about

112
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,840
Pod finder there you go. I want to talk about what's featured on the pod finder on the upcoming episode

113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,160
I think I actually have my outline here

114
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,880
Let me just open it up for a second hold on

115
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,520
Where is it?

116
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,160
Pod finder episode three. Let me tell you who's featured

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,080
I've been using Omni outliner recently. I don't know if you've checked that out

118
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,080
And I'm only using it because it does opml import an export if it had its own proprietary format

119
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Which it does and it didn't export anything else and I for sure would not be using it because I'm a big believer in the open formats

120
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Come on start up here we go

121
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,840
Okay, so we feature episode number two of the Spike Lee shadow cast which was made available today through iTunes

122
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
You might want to check that out. It's pretty cool

123
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
Dave's eye pack

124
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Tim Riley's city desk

125
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
Planet Japan podcast. That's a very cool one. I'll have to play that promo when I get back

126
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
The squad cast another great one

127
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,400
Played a clip of digital flotsome

128
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
Also the thunder cast one of my favorite morning coffee notes by the way

129
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,680
Dave whiner has now officially released his opml

130
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,280
application or opml editing tool and it's it's fantastic

131
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,480
You know it takes you like three seconds to kind of reset your brain and try and figure it out

132
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,640
But I think that particularly because this will be released in this is released as a free application and it's open source

133
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,360
At least I think parts of it are open source. I don't know all of it is open source

134
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,560
But you can download it and and use it for free

135
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Check it out at the scripting.com

136
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,240
It's going to be a great tool for a

137
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,120
Helping to manage the iPod the indie potter.org directory. I should say we got to change the graphics on that. Let's just go

138
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,080
Man, let's call this thing indie potter.org. I think that makes so much sense

139
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,760
So you can contribute to that by creating and maintaining nodes in a distributed fashion

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can also create your show notes with it

141
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,520
Which oh man that light is flashing you in fast now if I cut out then I'll just talk to you guys tomorrow

142
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,520
Okay, oh, maybe I'll do some on the plane, but it'll be Wednesday before you hear from you again

143
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
So you can basically you

144
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,400
You create your show notes entry in an outliner and I guess in fact you could actually import

145
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
I should try that see if I can import

146
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
An omni outliner outline anyway

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
You create your show notes in it you could actually

148
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,400
Add your podcast enclosure so you're file you could add that right into the outline

149
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,480
And then it publishes that into html which of course

150
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,320
Begets your show notes at the same time. It's an opml file

151
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,920
So I mean I couldn't quite even wrap my own head around it, but now we're basically creating show notes in html and opml

152
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,840
Simultaneously that is a big deal and you can cut and paste these things right into any other outline

153
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Including your outline

154
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,840
For instance for a directory node so you know when I get back I'm gonna really gonna play with it

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,160
The artwork then it'll take you to a subscription's page so it's it's very cool stuff

165
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,520
All right, well, it's gonna be a pretty short podcast because I'm really I'm excited

166
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,280
But I am very tired and I've got an early breakfast tomorrow

167
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Let's see

168
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:39,200
Journalist from newsweek is coming. I have to sign the paperwork for the apartment. I mean, oh my goodness the trials and tribulations

169
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,160
It's so horrible and I have print flip print the plenty out of that

170
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,400
I have plenty of promos and pod safe music that I want to play for you which I'm gonna do

171
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,920
Starting Wednesday when I get back now. I'll be back for about I think about a week and a half and then we go on vacation and

172
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,880
We're gonna go first. We've changed our plans just a little bit

173
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,040
So it's me Patricia Kristina. We're gonna go to New York for a spend a couple days in New York

174
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,520
Hope to Jersey where we use to live and meet some of the old neighbors and say hi and hang out

175
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,280
Have a barbecue of the weather permits, which I'm sure it will considering the heat wave

176
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,960
Then we're gonna fly to San Francisco and of course Patricia is very excited about the apartment as well

177
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
So it'll be some

178
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,600
Some buying of furniture and stuff and so we're gonna get the apartment all set up

179
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,960
We'll stay in a hotel first and maybe if we get the all the stuff we want in and on time

180
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,280
Then we'll actually stay at the apartment and of course I will contribute to to the furnishings of the apartment by

181
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Getting the new audio set up done

182
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
That'll be my contribution

183
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,600
So we're gonna stay out here for about a week. Then we're gonna do something very cool. We're gonna fly back to Vegas and

184
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,520
On our way home that is so will be a couple days in Vegas now

185
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,200
Since it is it's gonna you know vacation and what is a vacation right? There's always gonna be some kind of work going on

186
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,560
And when we're out in San friend

187
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sure that we'll be meeting with some people and we'll be hanging out and and I will have you know

188
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,840
It's not I don't consider any of this work really, but I'd want to spend

189
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
You know some real good quality time with the with the girl

190
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,120
So what I'm contemplating is asking the pod squad and

191
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Several of the pod show family members if they'd like to take over the hosting duties of the pod show on serious

192
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,680
So maybe we'll have Madge Weinstein do a day and we'll have dawn on Drew do another day

193
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,280
And maybe the same for the pod finder. I don't know I got to think about that, but

194
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,920
That's basically what we we used to do on the radio you know if you want a vacation when your colleagues would have to fill in and

195
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Do an extra shift so

196
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,240
And you're seeing is how there's so much cross pollination so many people doing promos for each other

197
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,040
Which at all rather third man he's doing promos all over the place for everyone including the four podcast four one one

198
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,440
So that's the general idea there. I do want to do the daily source code

199
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,880
And I think that I can probably get away with just you know we'll do a travel source code

200
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,840
You know we'll we'll talk about our travels where you view the day

201
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,320
We'll do some sound seeing in New York we'll do some sound seeing in San Francisco

202
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
We'll do of course some sound seeing from Vegas and

203
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
This coming Monday

204
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,800
August 1st Patricia and I have been invited to a party a playboy party in London and

205
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,360
I was specifically asked if I was interested in doing a sound seeing tour. Well, I thought about it

206
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,840
And I went you know, yeah, of course are you crazy?

207
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,400
So it'll be a sanctioned sound seeing tour of the playboy UK party

208
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,480
Dude, do I have a great job or what?

209
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,480
All right 15 minutes. That's it the microphone light is flashing like

210
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,960
You know, it's like now it's every half a second so it's about to die on me

211
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,240
I'm gonna go hit the hay. I'm gonna check in with you again

212
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,440

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,920
It'll be let me see I arrive lemon 30 so it'll it'll probably be a morning show for you because I have the times

214
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Don't work in my favor

215
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,120
So talk to you on Wednesday as I said. I'll have plenty of promos and pod safe music and
