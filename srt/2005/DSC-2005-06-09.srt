1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 1-9-2

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since radio is invented.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's Adam Curry!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You are a bitch!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh yeah!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh yeah!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh yeah!

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I apologise, I'ma dick!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh dick some respect!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Wanky stuff!

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh yeah!

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh yeah!

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're an unfamiliar dude!

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
B-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I bet you were hearing that wild cherry sign,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I was like, what is that?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,760
7 things is 78, something like that.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,460
Really think I'd give it shit shit shit

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,360
Well, what a hell of thick. I never did without thatè‰² fashiony thing. The colour all

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,180
You're a bird man

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,860
A new man made me cry. I hate you

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
You know, I'm an idiot

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,320
of the G-Move, the of the G-Move.

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Have you been drinking?

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Oh yeah.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
It's the MTV.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
It's the TV.

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
It's the TV.

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
It's the Disney.

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
It's the Disney.

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
It's the Disney.

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
It's the Disney.

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
It's the Disney.

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,320
What you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard.

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,320
At no point were you even close to anything that could be considered irrational thought.

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Everyone in this room is now dumber for having lessons to it.

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
To it.

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Oh boy.

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,320
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:06,320
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Hey everybody.

45
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
How you doing?

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,320
It is Thursday the 9th of June.

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Yeah.

48
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
As expected.

49
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Didn't have my head on straight yesterday.

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Like it's ever on straight.

51
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Apologies.

52
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Yesterday was not Tuesday.

53
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
It was Wednesday.

54
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,320
But of course it was actually still new music Tuesday.

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Because we hold those on Wednesday.

56
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Wednesday is here on the daily source.

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Right?

58
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Beautiful weather and gill for it at the Curry Cottage.

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Man.

60
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
I'm a little bit fuzzy today.

61
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,320
I think that's kind of what happened yesterday.

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,320
How often is it happen that you actually think for an entire day that is yesterday?

63
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Oh my goodness.

64
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
And we got a lot lined up for it today.

65
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Found some funky stuff that came into the email.

66
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,320
I've got an amazing blues song for Pod save music.

67
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Of course the obligatory promos.

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
No hit to this today.

69
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,320
The young palette was a pretty sparse but that's quite okay.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,320
What we've pulled for today is voices from the vault.

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,320
So play along with your movie, a trivia brain.

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Okay, I've been on the phone all morning.

73
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Still lots of crap to clean up in the Netherlands.

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,320
It's really hard when you move from one country to the next.

75
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,320
The more you've participated in the community, the harder it is to extract yourself from it.

76
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,320
You have no idea how hard it is actually to shut down contracts for power.

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,320
And electricity, gas, parking garages, you name it.

78
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,320
There's always someone with a handout from more.

79
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Which is a little bit discouraging but it's not anyway.

80
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,320
So it's, it hasn't been kind of a downer morning.

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
But I'm not going to let any of that.

82
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Not one single bit of that takeaway from the fun that I have every single day doing this show.

83
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
At least when I have time to do this show.

84
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Take it off with a mashup.

85
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,320
This is in light of, well, the jury is still being out on Michael Jackson.

86
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
I think you'll like this one.

87
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Don't stop movie Billy Jean S. Club 7 versus Michael Jackson.

88
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Right here on the Daily Source Code. How about a baseline?

89
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
All right.

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,320
I'll take synthesizers then.

91
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,320
The center is by Derek Peters.

92
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Got another Dutch guy.

93
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
There's a face.

94
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Everybody's moving through the rhythm.

95
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
That's a side.

96
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
It's a crazy world.

97
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
But tonight's the right.

98
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
It's the two eight stars.

99
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Don't be left behind.

100
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,320
I just feel the music moving through me everywhere.

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
And don't pass the nation baby.

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,320
We don't need to care if there's a place to be.

103
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,320
If you need the right and you can't shut up.

104
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Then you take you back.

105
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
And just go.

106
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,320
When we're married, baby.

107
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,320
How can season with your eyes?

108
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,320
It's very rough.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
It's not the way.

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
It's wrong.

111
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
It's wrong.

112
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
It's wrong.

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
It's wrong.

114
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
It's wrong.

115
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
It's wrong.

116
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
It's wrong.

117
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
It's wrong.

118
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
It's wrong.

119
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
It's wrong.

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
It's wrong.

121
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
It's wrong.

122
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
It's wrong.

123
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
It's wrong.

124
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
It's wrong.

125
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
It's wrong.

126
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
It's wrong.

127
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
It's wrong.

128
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
It's wrong.

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
It's wrong.

130
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
It's wrong.

131
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
It's wrong.

132
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
It's wrong.

133
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
It's wrong.

134
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
It's wrong.

135
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
It's wrong.

136
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
It's wrong.

137
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
It's wrong.

138
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
It's wrong.

139
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
It's wrong.

140
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
It's wrong.

141
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
It's wrong.

142
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
It's wrong.

143
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
It's wrong.

144
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
It's wrong.

145
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
It's wrong.

146
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
It's wrong.

147
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
It's wrong.

148
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
It's wrong.

149
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
It's wrong.

150
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
It's wrong.

151
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
It's wrong.

152
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
It's wrong.

153
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
It's wrong.

It's wrong.

It's wrong.

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
It's wrong.

157
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
It's right.

158
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
It's wrong.

00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

180
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,880
my friends playing Michael Jackson on the daily source code down the

181
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,440
reason for that. Actually by the time you hear this podcast I don't know

182
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
the jury may still be out the jury may be in. I still want to pledge my

183
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
support from Michael Jackson. I met the man. I think he's if anything he's

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,920
asexual. We've discussed that many many times on the source code but what

185
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,600
really it really sucks is all these other stories that crop up and I just

186
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,960
have to feel a little bit of that. Because I've witnessed this myself. I

187
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,600
see there's a what is it that was a CNN article. Michael Jackson's going to

188
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,680
lose the Beatles catalog and you know and they report this as research news but

189
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,280
you know the first paragraph alone says according to people familiar with

190
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,720
the transaction you know it's like I've had so many people guess about my

191
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,880
finances or about whatever is going on with any kind of companies or sometimes

192
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,320
even legal hassle and you know what happens and this has been identified by

193
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,800
many people and once you start giving out interviews and seeing that what

194
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,120
comes back is not what you meant to communicate of course it is what you

195
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,400
communicated because that's a two-way street you know it's whatever you say

196
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,080
whatever the person hears they probably already have a story written in their

197
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,440
head and they're just feeling the blanks and their own blanks and they miss out

198
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,920
on the on the bullets you're shooting on the on the live load so that is it is

199
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,360
your miss communication and that's just something you got to learn and yeah

200
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,120
you can never really get it 100% the way you want it very rarely I would say

201
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,720
but people take really cheap shots they really do in the press it's yeah

202
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,280
it's they forget that there is a person behind Michael Jackson and it's funny

203
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,000
because I was I had an email conversation with Father Roderick from the Catholic

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,680
Insider and he he put up a really funny interview with the Arnold Schwarzenegger

205
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,680
today at Catholic Insider.com now he didn't really interview the governor

206
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,920
but you probably heard that Schwarzenegger is podcasting himself so he

207
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,040
spliced it up and he put together an interview with Arnold's answers it was

208
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,200
very cute it was funny and obviously you know was meant as a joke and he's

209
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,680
getting all kinds of flack in the Netherlands which is a country that that does

210
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,120
this all the time you know saying he's politically motivated and what what

211
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,920
Father Roderick is really noticing now is he's getting some fame and when or

212
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,600
notoriety or recognition or whatever you want whatever you word you want to

213
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,120
use once you're out there you start to slowly develop a target and the

214
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,840
more you're in the media in the in the press the larger that target becomes and

215
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,480
it just seems to be it's always been this way I believe but it seems now

216
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,160
more than ever you know when news organizations and news programming is

217
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,920
looking for something shocking something you know that we can identify with

218
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,680
and they're looking for the next thing to roll out well we all can identify with

219
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:12,120
drama so what's happening to Michael Jackson is the identification of drama for

220
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,480
the audience not that we have the same type of drama but right and high and

221
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,720
getting kicked down that's that's you know the rollercoaster that's pretty much

222
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,320
what it seems to be and and in the Netherlands people really love doing that

223
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,120
to people who are notorious or famous or or recognized in the media so I'm

224
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,880
saying a special prayer for my buddy Father Roderick for sure it's P-dog no it's

225
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,160
not it is yeah look at this P-dog this is P-W Fenton create we're a radio for

226
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,400
radios digital flots and I'm here to tell you I am a big fan of Mad wine

227
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,680
steams yeast radio I am also here to make a confession anyone who is

228
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,320
listened to digital flots and knows that I often tell personal stories from my

229
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,320
life but I think that you should know that there are still some things I haven't

230
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,560
talked about one of those things is that for my whole adult life I have secretly

231
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,640
felt that I was a lesbian trapped in a man's body I just can't help it ever since

232
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:22,840
puberty I've just been attracted to women oh I'm so glad I got that off my

233
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,000
chest thanks Madge you rock my world and I'm not ashamed to say it

234
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,880

237
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,920

producing them thank you yeah right on good to see the blind casters joining

242
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,200
the fray and that's interesting I've had a lot of conversations recently

243
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,720
about something called accessibility of your Mac user then you you recognize

244
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
this it's in your system preferences I know Windows has something equivalent but

245
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm not quite sure what it's called maybe accessibility as well I don't know

246
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,360
and it's basically how the interface reacts with spoken with spoken digitized

247
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,680
voice to tell the the user what it's doing or what the mouse is doing or

248
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,400
what button you're hovering over etc and let me to think excuse me that's

249
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,960
let me to think that or to wonder if iTunes actually has good accessibility and

250
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,560
if we need any additional accessibility specifically for podcasts I couldn't

251
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,600
think of any off the bat but then again I'm not in the blind situation so I

252
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,800
I you know maybe I should pondered more maybe you have some ideas maybe some of

253
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,720
the blind casters out there some good ideas and please let me know if if

254
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,360
iTunes has good accessibility built into it at all probably does because I

255
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,240
think the Mac is is generally reasonably good at that and I was talking to

256
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,440
one of the developers on the iPod 11 team Andrew Grummit the other day and

257
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,160
he said that that's one of the things that he's really concentrating on is

258
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,120
getting a lot more accessibility built into iPod 11 so that's very good news

259
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,280
and out there's big markets big markets are opening up let me see what else

260
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,920
oh man should I do this now yeah I'm going to do this now this was so funny I

261
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,440
got an email yesterday home I have to get on my browser here was it dawn's

262
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,720
blog I think it was hold on I'm going to open up what is this opening up now my

263
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:13,880
computer is this opening up Safari or yeah it's opening up Safari okay this was

264
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:22,480
a cloning warning complete conspiracy theorist theorist blog post from

265
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,360
Don's blog and of course I'll post the link in the show notes listening to

266
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,960
the recent Steve Jobs keynote at Apple's worldwide developer conference I

267
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,560
was struck with a similarity in voice between Roz Ho who was one of the

268
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,840
Microsoft that she is what is she oh Microsoft Mac business unit leader and

269
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,600
the venerable Bill Gates so this is what Don is basically saying he's saying and

270
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,840
if you saw the worldwide developer conference keynote thing you know Steve Jobs

271
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,160
usually brings people up on stage and one of them was Roz Ho who looks very

272
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,280
cute in the picture here on Don's blog and so she's the Mac business unit leader

273
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,320
over at Microsoft and what he wants us to do is listen to the original clip of

274
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,760
Roz so I'm going to click on that now see what she says thank you Steve is getting

275
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,440
to be quite a habit to be here it's my pleasure to be here on stage today and

276
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:29,560
to be involved in the exciting changes from Apple for choices than ever okay so

277
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,680
that is Roz and then and here comes Don this is the same file process

278
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,120
through garage band with the tone lowered a fraction and he says is it

279
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:48,680
was getting to be quite a habit to be here it's my pleasure to be here on stage

280
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:58,600
today and to be involved in the exciting changes from Apple I'm telling you I

281
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,800
think Don has a point here there's something going on it could be that Microsoft

282
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,960
is spinning out clones and they're everywhere

283
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,400
hello my name is Scott and I'm Kelly and we're the creators of my virtualband.com

291
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,440
all right I think that's you know it's not a new idea people have been collaborating

292
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,520
on on music on the internet through MIDI sound files etc for a long long time

293
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,840
what was it called myvirtualband.com I had an idea for them all of a sudden virtualband.com

294
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,400
there we go so they have a podcast let me see blah blah blah myvirtualband featured songs

295
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,400
okay because here's here's the big idea I think for these guys let me see

296
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,000
yeah exactly they don't they're not doing it okay so the idea here is you create a soundtracking

297
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,040
you upload that in some form of in some form that can be imported into someone else's music

298
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,520
program and they can add tracks and then they can re-upload the result of that so

299
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:55,720
here's what I think is a really big idea what if you created an RSS 2.0 with enclosure

300
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:02,920
feed to a podcast feed for each of those songs so basically I could subscribe to a group

301
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,920
whether a participant in the group or not I could subscribe to what they're working on on a

302
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,240
particular song so when the first original is released you know the one that everyone's going to

303
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,360
work on that automatic comes into my iPod or my iTunes whenever and I can listen to that.

304
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,400
now when someone does something to it and uploads a new version then that new version would

305
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,160
flow to me automatically and I could actually be a bystander witnessing that creation in the process

306
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,520
I think that's a pretty hot shit that would really rock pod save music now on the source code

307
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:59,240
and dear the lights come on darling let's get real close

308
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:10,520
because I want you to hold me tight

309
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:31,160
I want you to break all day and all in just for a night

310
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:39,800
let's let love have its way

311
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:29,800
and to feel your tender hands all over my body

312
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:40,440
and my face you both get lost in ecstasy

313
00:24:41,240 --> 00:25:01,800

314
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,800
And a heart, finger tips

315
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,800
We live for all loves

316
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,800
With fantasy

317
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Every chorus

318
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Little brain pure

319
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800

In the past

322
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800

In the instant scene

325
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,800
If you left a thrill

326
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Because of what?

327
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,800
We'll share

328
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,800
We don't belong

329
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,800

369

382
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,860
The imaging is just awesome.

383
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,860
Hey, now I got a nice email from Aaron from Bitterman Circle.

384
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
What's this?

385
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,860
Is there more on that?

386
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,860
Or is this like some secret message?

387
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,860
So, back mask, can we need to do here?

388
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
Yeah.

389
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,860

390
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
And he has invite...

391
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,860

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,860
And he's invited Christina and I to...

394
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860

395
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,860

396
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
So, that'll be pretty cool.

397
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Maybe we should podcast some of that.

398
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
At least, hopefully we'll get backstage.

399
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,860
We can do some of the backstage podcast and got another.

400
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
All right.

401
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,860
That's it for today.

402
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,860
