00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Daily source code February 3rd 2005.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Transmators?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We don't need no stinkin' transmators.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Get ready for the generation of rocker.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Autistic is Adam Curry.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's Thursday, February 3rd 2005.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The power of the Lord is the Lord.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Once again, welcome to the Daily source code.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hi everybody, my name is Adam Curry.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Coming to you from a brand new studio setup,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which I thought was going to be really convenient.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But it's actually not.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I got to take a picture of this.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've now completed my podcast console armchair studio.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You need to see this picture.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Got this huge green recliner.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I think let me see if I can take a picture of my camera phone right now.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
While I'm at this, this is just too good.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've got it totally tricked down now.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hold on.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's get the camera portion of this.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of course, I won't actually take a picture of my hair, right?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That would be bad.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There we go.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I have that look.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hmm.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Lots to do some more.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey, today is trivia Thursday.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That means we've got lots and lots of trivia.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Some promos and pod safe tunes right here on your source code.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So I've actually been shooting now.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This thing is already into delayed mode.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sounding like I'm drunk as usual.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let me just grab a little cup of coffee.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's 120 in the afternoon on Thursday here and go for the curry cottage.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I was going to bring Patricia into talks and show her his crap and stuff.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I didn't know that she had a appointment at the nail salon.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So unfortunately, won't be able to bring her into the show today.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But I had a great morning.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As I said, getting the pod cast armchair console all ready to roll.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, I've got the breakout box to my left here.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Coffee's on top of that.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Got this thing called it's the plateau de foté, which is kind of like a,

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What would you call that?

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A tray, kind of like a tray that you use for TV dinners.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it clips onto the side of this huge green armchair that I have.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is a recliner.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And there's probably about at least 100 people who know this chair.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because this is the chair that I had in my office in New York at Think New

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ideas.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And it's just this huge, gotty green leather reclining chair.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It has kind of a, yeah, a little bit of a chest of field vibe to it.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Like a modern chest of field.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And you can almost recline completely flat out.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You control the reclining level kind of by balancing your feet on the,

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
On the footstool that comes up and the pressure you put on your back.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I got the laptop on that tray.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I have the microphone right here to my left.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Actually, I've set it up so that I now can test the other mic that I have.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hold on.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want to turn this one off.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And here's the, oh, that does sound kind of different.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Doesn't, hold on.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Turn that up a second.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hold on.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let me just set this hijacked thing to.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, I'm at it.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There we go.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The reason I hope this up is because I now have two microphones in, in the breakout box.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It does sound different.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's also significantly less quality, or let's,

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe the price to quality performance actually isn't that bad.

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because this is a realistic microphone.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's right.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's from radio shack.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's the one that kind of looks like a sure microphone.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't have a, a windscreen on it.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let me see.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Was there a model number on this?

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's, I'll turn on the other microphone.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll turn on this one while I'm talking.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a 33-1070B.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Whatever that means dynamic microphone.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
On the directional made in Mexico.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So now I'm talking on the, on the radio shack mic.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And now I'm back on the sure microphone.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I know you can tell the difference, but in a pinch,

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you know, if Patricia walks in,

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can finally just hand her a mic.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And she can participate in the show.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And that's what I was already for.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Uh-huh.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Guess what?

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ain't gonna happen.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Michael Jackson says he's innocent.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ronald says so too.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
With rimpters like this voice bomb.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
One can a humanitarian do.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The second phase of jury selection has begun.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When their chosen will one side already have one.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hillary Clinton fainted as she tried to give a speech.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Does this mean she won't be painted?

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Is the residency in her reach?

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Or will momentum shift?

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The bar brought boxer?

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A little attack.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This might have boxer.

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Leonardo DiCaprio's life of achievements.

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
At the elderly age of 30.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let to an Oscar usually given prior to bereavements.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
At least as acceptance speech will not be worthy.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A rackie votes are being counted.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Press the fire on the skin of stop.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But the Shiites are sure they won't.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So they're not likely just to drop it.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They said the government will allow the suitees in.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's too silly to tell.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If all will go well.

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But then again it will demand the bomb to spin.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Stay tuned for light breaking.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All done.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's the tap dancing.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Podcasting news.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Always great to hear another tap dancing podcast.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The news update.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
On the today's show as I tease the beginning.

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's Thursday.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So we're going to try and keep Thursday for trivia day.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Young polette has been sending in these hit tests, which are so highly produced and so exciting.

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And surprising actually yesterday.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He slipped in an old air check of mine from Z100 in New York.

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Which is me just puke and all over the place man.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey everybody.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can see 100.

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You wonder why I can do that so well.

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because I'm just I've done it so long.

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
A couple of the things we were talking about yesterday.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
One I was talking about typing that my typing skills are a good.

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm a very fast typeer.

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But that I just can't type blindly.

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've gotten a lot of comments.

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And by the way, we've got to figure out a way to incorporate all this stuff.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Maybe I need some kind of different weblogs set up or something.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Because often.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So if you listen to a podcast and you go back to the entry on daily source code.com.

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's a link to the show notes.

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You also want to look at the comments.

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because comments often contain links to things that I've talked about.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Or just good ideas.

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Or maybe there's an MP3 that I couldn't find.

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You want to look at those comments.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So really what we need to do is start to aggregate all this stuff together.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So that when you listen to a show or if you go back and listen to an archive show.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Or you know, however you are checking it out if you want to hear more.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You know, that you'll be able to find a kind of all in one place.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So already it's starting to get a bit of control.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I figured this out.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So Cindy, better known as squipper.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Who is one half of the Ken and Squip show.

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Said, Adam, it's easy for you to break the habit of looking at the keys while you type.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Just get yourself a poster size keyboard layout that you can hang on a wall in front of your laptop or desktop.

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Force yourself to look up at the poster and not at the keyboard.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And you'll get the hang of it in no time.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And of course there's a link there to a poster, which haven't printed out yet.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But what I will do and I actually have been trying this.

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I've been forcing myself to look at the screen not the keyboard as I'm typing.

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It makes for some interesting typing.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll tell you that.

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's some interesting words pop up.

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But I'm getting better.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I think you're right.

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Cindy, I think it is just a question of, yeah, just doing it.

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Also some people have sent in comments saying that I shouldn't necessarily discount

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
our computer-based programming that will help you learn how to type blind.

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Excuse me, don't I just have a sip of my coffee here?

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hmm.

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh man.

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So since we have, since it's trivia Thursday, we're not only going to do young

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Polettes trivia, we'll also be doing a couple other ones.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Some different types of trivia came in today.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So that's on the way.

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And also, as usual, some questions, comments, and some podcasts.

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If music coming up.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hello Adam, this is Jeff Venture from Poland.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hello.

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hello.

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm going to make crank up.

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to crank up that sound.

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
See, this is the problem when I get shoot.

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
When I get MP3s that recorded just in a very, very low volume.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And then you don't notice it until you're actually on the, well, on the, until you're doing

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the show.

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm going to crank this one up as far as it can go.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So I'm actually opening up the quick time player preferences for this MP3 file.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Sounds like this is also one channel, hold on a second.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's see what's going on.

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hello Adam.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is Jeff Venture from Cooking on the Radio.

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And listening to today's show, I heard somebody talking a little bit about

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
MP3 players that will display song lyrics.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And it may be a way to get show notes, which got me thinking about the new photo iPods.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This might be something that could be scripted for the sound seeing tours.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Now, hearing people snapping pictures along the way and being able to get the visual element

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
with the podcast as some people have been doing online has certainly been great.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But wouldn't it be really cool if as you're listening to your podcast on your photo,

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
based iPod, if the images would appear on the screen synchronized to the podcast.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, it's actually something we've been talking about.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, hold on a second for your technical question.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah, we haven't talking about that.

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm not quite sure how it works on the iPod photo.

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I also don't know how many of those.

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I have a feeling for some reason.

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I could be wrong that the iPod photo is maybe the cube of the iPod line up that

217
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
maybe this is just something that's so pretty and so beautiful,

218
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
but so not extra functional that people don't buy it.

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I have no idea what the sales statistics are on the iPod photo,

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but clearly that would be great.

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I mean, Apple has all of the capability to make that, you know,

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
make that work.

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And maybe we'd have to use AAC files or something that can send along a tone to kick the

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
iPod photo into switching the next photo in the slideshow.

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But yeah, it would be nice.

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, now back to your technical question.

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Which is what I'm using to record right now.

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I know that when you record with yours, you use a wireless microphone set up.

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm using a wired-level ear mic.

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And when I record in mono mode,

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't get any audio recorded on the device at all.

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It seems that my mono microphone is coming in on the left channel.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, no shit.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Which the Irivers default settings to record mono.

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It records the right channel.

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Which is that being completely blank of audio.

237
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Because you don't, yeah, it does.

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's one of if you had any experience with this,

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
would love to hear your feedback and love to show.

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No.

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Keep it up.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, do it.

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Totally.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What you need to do is you need to put the Irivers.

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
As far as I know, once a stereo jack to be inserted,

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you're probably inserting a mono jack.

247
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't ever insert anything that's just mono.

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And that's why it's probably only hitting the left channel.

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's probably also why it's so damn soft.

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Although, I think on the Iriver, you can set the levels.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I was just really almost inaudible.

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I know that people sitting there going,

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
can't hear it cranking up the volume.

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I know, I know.

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We try to do our best with these things.

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So I would suggest getting a conversion wire,

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
or maybe waking up making one,

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that'll take your, have a female mono jack going into a stereo

259
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and just basically combining those two channels together

260
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
because obviously that sucks to have it only record one channel.

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I think it's not a question of the, of the Iriver

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
only wanting to record one channel.

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You probably just have the wrong jack.

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And it's probably even fucking up the volume.

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Also, yesterday, what we're talking about,

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we talked about Steve Leeds and,

267
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and serious, sadly I was talking about the bandwidth

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
of the satellite that's serious.

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's pretty much, they can't add any more channels

270
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
because they don't have any more spectrum available.

271
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I was saying that this is probably measured in megabits per second

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and therefore no more bandwidth.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They even have some of the torque channels now in mono

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
so that they can squeeze more channels in.

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Email from Rob Freedon says Adam,

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
answer to your question about the satellite bandwidth is measured.

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The unit of capacity for satellites is the transponder.

278
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Transponders?

279
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We don't.

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No stink in transponders.

281
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
These units are measured in megahertz.

282
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Usually 36 to 72 megahertz.

283
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Of course, you can make a conversion from bandwidth

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
to throughput, which is a digital environment

285
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and it's measured in bits per second.

286
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I am a telecom's professor at Penn State University

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and teach this stuff.

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You might have interest in a tech course syllabus

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
on my web page.

290
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And of course, you provide the link

291
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
which you can find in the show notes for today.

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Cool.

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Very cool.

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'd like to know more.

295
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe you couldn't help me out with some of this

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
conversion stuff and let's figure out how much

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it would be kind of cool to figure that out.

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Because I think that I believe serious

299
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
is actually using the AAC codec,

300
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
which is what Apple uses for bookmarking

301
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
capabilities, what Apple uses.

302
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Although it's pretty much similar to MP3,

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I believe, and it's licensing capabilities

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and it's probably even compresses a little bit better.

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But I'd like to know how many bits per second

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
they're using per channel and just what exactly

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
their capacity is.

308
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
By the way, can I just say that I'm very proud

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
of Professor's listening to the show?

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No, I never would have thought it.

311
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hi, Adam. This is Jaime Wattis.

312
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I wanted to talk to you about two things.

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
First of all, podcast, avalemos.

314
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So slowly but surely, it's coming along.

315
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I got my first interview done.

316
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's both in Spanish and in English.

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Just subscribe to the appropriate feed

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and you'll get the right language.

319
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So there were URL for it.

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's www.battis.org-ablemos-ablemos.cgi.

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And Battis is spelled B-A-T-I-Z.

322
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Ablemos is spelled H-A-B-L-E-M-O-S.

323
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And I hope you'll have a chance to listen to it

324
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and to mention it in your show

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
so that a lot more people might want to check it out.

326
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Second thing is about this,

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:27,000
so the Spanish node has a couple of entries of mine.

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Now, this avalemos podcast and my first one.

329
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So I want to volunteer.

330
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If nobody else has volunteer already

331
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
to maintain that part of the directory.

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So you'll just have to walk me through

333
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
about OPML, what do I have to do in my own server

334
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
to get that going, but I love to help with that?

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So please stay in touch.

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
My email is jb.podcast.com

337
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and looking forward to listening for me

338
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
from you.

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay.

340
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay, thanks a lot.

341
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Hi, my excellent.

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Of course, if you don't have me for a while,

343
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
he's been doing these Spanish language podcast,

344
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
also some Spanish podcast.

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And he mentioned the, I potted out org directory.

346
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes, I'd love for you to maintain the Spanish node.

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And this is actually something we haven't talked about

348
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
in a while, but pretty important.

349
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The I potted out org directory is different

350
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
from other podcast directories that you'll see.

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
First of all, it's not really a directory,

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
like for instance, we have podcast alley,

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
which I like a lot because it has a voting feature

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and rating feature and people love those

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and it drives a lot of traffic to the directory.

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But when it comes to really maintaining a useful resource,

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I think I potted out org does someone better job.

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Also, all the information from I potted out org,

359
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the actual directory itself,

360
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
is made available through an opml file,

361
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
which anyone can use to populate their own directory,

362
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
which I don't know if podcast alley does it,

363
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
but I know a number of others do.

364
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So feel free to just click on the XML icon

365
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
in the podcast directory at ipotted.org.

366
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That is the opml file, which you can suck in periodically.

367
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And it's just an opml file full of RSS URLs,

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
which you can then parse to get channel names,

369
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
titles, descriptions, et cetera.

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But what's great about it is I don't maintain it all by myself.

371
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In fact, I do very little work on it,

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
except for what's new and categories

373
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that aren't currently maintained by someone else.

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But all I have to do is just receive a URL from

375
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Limey for instance, which he'll create an opml file for

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and he just plugs in some RSS links to podcast feeds.

377
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And all I have to do is paste the URL of his opml file

378
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
into my outline for the ipotted.org directory,

379
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and it's all taken care of.

380
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So when you're in the directory and you actually click on

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the language node and go into Spanish,

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
then you'll get Himey's listing.

383
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And on the website for ipotted.org,

384
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
if you're in that level of the directory and you want to add a link,

385
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
there'll be a suggest a link that you just click on.

386
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It'll automatically go to the maintainer of that node.

387
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Anybody can participate.

388
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Just send me an email, adamaccurry.com.

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If you want to know how to do these opml files

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
as a whole bunch of documentation,

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
it's ipotted.org slash contribute.

392
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And if you want to know more about how it all works,

393
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Ipotted.org slash documentation.

394
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
All of that can be found.

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Once again, ipotted.org.

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Love to have your opml file as a part of this Himey.

397
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's a great way to maintain a directory

398
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
because there's no real top level.

399
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Nobody actually has full control.

400
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And when you put it into the ipotted.org directory,

401
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
it will eventually flow through to other directories

402
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that are out there and into most ipotted software.

403
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So love to see some more Spanish stuff in there.

404
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I've been getting a lot of emails about Brad Sox.

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We've played Brad Sox on the show before.

406
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Brad Sox is a guy that does everything all by himself.

407
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Makes his own music, plays it, records it,

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and is getting lots of airplane podcasts.

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And I received two new songs.

410
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Would say they're demos, but I like them.

411
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So I'm a son and I know why.

412
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Then I'll read and try to tell it.

413
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Tell me, tell me, then I'm out as well.

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
In a book, in a book, in a book, in a book.

415
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
In a book.

453
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
In a book.

454
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,840
He's got some great tunes going on. Okay, it's trivia Thursday. I have one, two, three, four,

455
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,320
five different trivia quizzes that have come in. I think it's only fair to start off with the

456
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,920
granddaddy of the trivia test. Well, other people have sent in trivia tests before,

457
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,560
but young Paulette, this guy from Holland who started off with a mix between a Dutch version

458
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,920
of you don't own me and the Bitties version of you don't own me. Really has put together

459
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,680
these wonderfully produced tests that just blow me away. And young, by the way, you don't have

460
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,600
to do on every single day. I mean, he's already saying dude, you know, like, I don't know if I

461
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,360
can produce one or everything. You don't have to. I really appreciate it. And anything you do is just

462
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:12,080
so incredibly cool. And today's, uh, today's, once again, he's not only produced, but it's got

463
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,480
jingles and sweepers and all kinds of beautiful stuff. Let's get tranquil.

464
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,240
Hi, Adam. This is young Paulette with another hit this day young. As you've probably noticed,

465
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,800
I've got a new segments opener or a leader. I love and courtesy of Kevin, one of the members

466
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:43,200
of RadioDeady.com he provided me with things I could really work with. But by the way, RadioDeady.com

467
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,080
is fucking great. I think I'm going to participate in that pretty soon. That seems like a great

468
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,520
community where we just kind of create jingles and sweepers for each other. It's a big trading post.

469
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,000
Love it. Love that opener by the way. Thanks to him and thanks to RadioDeady.com for providing

470
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,760
a great service. I also saw a lot of comments about the air check I used in yesterday's hit

471
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:11,040
test. Unfortunately, this was the only one I could really use. I've got one other, but I don't know

472
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,920
which records being played. So maybe you could help me out with it. Here it is.

473
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:50,160
It's really strange to notice that when you're listening to these kinds of things and you feel the

474
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,520
power of the leaders and the sweepers and the music, your voice automatically locks in DJI position.

475
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Everybody that's right. Rock and play throw. One hundred. By the way, we always had to end with

476
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,200
either Z100 or W HTZ New York. Those were the rules. You could not end with anything else.

477
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,840
You also couldn't front announce a song. That's actually I think that's still illegal technically.

478
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,720
I think that was, I can't remember the name of that song. This was like late 80s, early 90s.

479
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,840
This was all that girl group disco shit. I don't remember and it probably wouldn't have been a good

480
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,920
one for Holda, drunkenness. It probably wouldn't have been a good one for

481
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,320
for the hit test because well, I wouldn't have guessed it.

482
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,720
All right. Just like I would like to address the daily source code listeners if you

483
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,880
don't mind. Because I assume amongst them there are a lot of people that have been following you

484
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:54,080
for a while now. If so and if they do have actually extra recordings of shows from the past,

485
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,360
I would really like it if they could send them to me.

486
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,800
There's, oh, that's not the only have. Well, wait a minute. I sent my box of tapes to

487
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
Tom Schooting, who lives in Australia. He has a podcast feed. A lot of that is the Dutch stuff,

488
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,760
which of course I know you'll appreciate. It's in the iPod.org directory under

489
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,160
radio shows, the Korean Van English show. I'm pretty sure though, Tom also has some Z100 air

490
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,800
checks and maybe some other stuff. I'll just threw everything into that box. So maybe he can

491
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:32,480
help you out with that. Pinto a Gmail account. It's hittest at gmail.com. So it's hit.txt at gmail.com or in

492
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,280
an increased dial or aviation style. It's hotel in the at 10 o'clock angle. Echoes at gmail.com.

493
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,560
It would be really great to be able to put some objects in a house once in a while. Talking about

494
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:53,120
hit tests. Okay. We go. Yeah. Now put the air books and get out your pencil. It's time for Adam

495
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Curry to take the hit test. All right, you don't pull it. All right, but this is a big

496
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,640
different from the earlier ones. Okay. Um, it's a special one. It's an 80s pill ball. He did

497
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,200
it. Yeah, baby cowbells. So here we go. This is number one. Crank it.

498
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,960
Cowbell is killing me.

499
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:30,320
Feels like heaven. Is that, uh, is that, uh, timid thing? Fiction, uh, fiction factor? Feels like

500
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:40,480
heaven. Siction factor. That's one. Number two. Cowbell is distracting. Is this street life?

501
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:49,600
Ready Crawford and was it the persuaded street life? It's the only way I know. No, maybe it's not street life.

502
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,440
No, I'm, I don't know the shore. Number three. All right.

503
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,200
Wow. Uh, this is, it does not deserve cowbell. It wasn't that big a hit. Is this, uh,

504
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,200
Kaji Guga? Boom. I think it's, be the Le Mansollo or Kaji Guga? I can't remember.

505
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:25,680
You can tell just by the baseline. All right. Answer. All right, let's get to the ancestors right away.

506
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Okay, this was number one

507
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,680
From 1984

508
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,480
Yeah, and still going to have a big got one right

509
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Sing along

510
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Number two

511
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Street live in 1981

512
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Never too much, this is loop of ocean

513
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Of course, loop of band rows

514
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Oh man, I'll put it messed up one

515
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Yeah

516
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,680
And this is number three

517
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
Can't you go?

518
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Yeah, can't you go?

519
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Big got up all that's the time, right?

520
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Okay, two out of three ain't bad

521
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
I think?

522
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Not bad for today

523
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
There you go

524
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
Well, that's it for today

525
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
If you do have an act check of how I'm doing

526
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Please send it to us at email.com

527
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,680
To send your feedback or suggestions

528
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
See you all next time for another contest

529
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Oh, young, thank you very much

530
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
I can't tell you how much I appreciate all the work you put into that

531
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
It's really really awesome

532
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
I have a lot of fun doing that

533
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
And the feedback I get from people is just amazing

534
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Who are sitting in their cars or in buses or on the subway and are playing along with it

535
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
It's really a lot of fun

536
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Okay, it is tribute Thursday

537
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,680
So besides, well, that is the example that we have to live by what young is doing

538
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
But some other interesting submissions came in

539
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Let's see, which one was this, let me see

540
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Oh, no, another shit, another thing I just got a crank

541
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,680
So the reason why I can't use a compressor limiter is because

542
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,680
And we're talking about this later on in the show if we have time for it

543
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,680
Is because if I put that in audio hijack pro, which I'm using

544
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
What happens is it also cranks up the microphone

545
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
So, yeah, I can't separate the two channels

546
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Let's see how it works now

547
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
We're really getting a kick from these song trivia

548
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
MP3s you keep getting in

549
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Anyway, I've got a little trivia here for you

550
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
It's 80s, classic TV things

551
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Anyway, here they go

552
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
I don't give you the answer straight afterwards

553
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Magna PI

554
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Okay, here what that is

555
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
That would be the 80s

556
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
That would be the 80s

557
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
That would be the 80s

558
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Growing pains or family ties

559
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
I think it's

560
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Believe it or not, it's just me

561
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Is that going on?

562
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,680
No, you need to try humming that theme

563
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,680
The answer is the first one is Magnum

564
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Magnum

565
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Magna PI got that one

566
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Okay, number three is the 80s

567
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
18, what was four?

568
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Number four, the greatest American hero

569
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
Greatest American hero

570
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Okay, damn, 50% not too good today on the trivia

571
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
I was able to crank it up a little bit by the way

572
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,680
But now of course the next one will be a thousand times too loud

573
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Let's see, this is the next trivia quiz

574
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Yet another idea came in here

575
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Hey Adam, it's Todd Maffin from iLoveRidio.org

576
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
You took a game show for you

577
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
This one's called Lost in Translation

578
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Here's how it works, okay. I'm going to read you the lyrics of a song from the 80s

579
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
However, they're not the lyrics you're probably used to

580
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,680
These are lyrics that have been put through the altivist a translator

581
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Translated from English to German

582
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Then I take that translation

583
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,680
And I will translate them back from German to English

584
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
And I will read you the lyrics as they come out by the computer

585
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Lost in translation trivia, I love the idea

586
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
We'll be a bit garbled

587
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Your task is to figure out what the computer is trying to say with these lyrics

588
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
What is the original source song?

589
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
I like this, good. I'm going to be the answer at the end

590
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Bring it on

591
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,680
If you do not leave to be in this way, which I cannot survive

592
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Oh baby, cannot remain alive

593
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Leaves to me in this way not

594
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Without your love

595
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
What the hell is that?

596
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
I thought it was going to be Chicago if you leave me now

597
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
But then you take away the biggest part of me, it doesn't fit

598
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
So I'm not sure what this is supposed to be

599
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Is it tough man?

600
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Oh, this is my thinking time here

601
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Of course, it's the commune of the story

602
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Of course, the commune of the story is the commune of the story

603
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
But don't leave me this way

604
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Both don't leave me this way

605
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Oh, your hands are the air on the forehead

606
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Like your best times

607
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,920
Excellent dude. I like that. That's pretty cool actually. That's a good good idea for a trivia test

608
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,480
We continue with our Thursday trivia with our next submission

609
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,600
Now I've got to watch the levels here because I've cranked everything up. It's blowing my eardrums out

610
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,900
Hey there, Adam. It's Howard Greenstein from New York. Oh, Howard. This is a trivia stuff people have been by the way. Harry Howard Greenstein is the

611
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Is shoot who's this car?

612
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:16,000
Sorry, I'm in the middle of a podcast. I have no time for you. He turned me on to a very coral. He's related. You same

613
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,160
Way too easy. So I figured I'd give you a little bit of a challenge today

614
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,680
So this time I'm giving you a montage. It's no no whole intro is to song

615
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:31,240
You've got to pick out a piece of a song one DJ to another. Let's see how you do with this montage on the theme of

616
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,720
Daily for the Daily Source code. Okay. Can you figure out who sang these songs?

617
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Deleting to the days of the week. Hit me. Let's go

618
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
One more try

619
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,400
Stop stop stop stop stop stop. Whoa that went way too fast. Okay, first of all

620
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,000
I heard I heard of beetles in there

621
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
For Wednesday. I heard Saturday in the park Chicago

622
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,520
We winded a bit. Hold on. Let's listen again

623
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
One more try

624
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Monday

625
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,960
I don't know what that is. Let me try it again

626
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,540
Well, wait Tuesday is Ruby Tuesday rolling stones Wednesday. It's the beetles

627
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,600
I don't know the name of track. Let's see you the next one

628
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,520
There's a none and it's also beetles Thursday Friday is

629
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
Saturday in the park

630
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:46,280
Oh, man. This is really hard. Okay. So what do we have money? I didn't get Ruby Tuesday Wednesdays the beetles Thursdays the beetles

631
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,360
Saturday in the park Chicago, so I haven't heard and I don't know Monday

632
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,560
What are I missing Monday Friday and Sunday? Okay, hold on. Let's try this again

633
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,360
One more try

634
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,040
Shit, that's hard. Okay, I didn't see how you did. Yeah

635
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,640
Did you know that this one was

636
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,360
New moon on Monday. Oh, the grand RAM. Oh, dude. That was tough

637
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,000
I sure you got me. Oh, yeah, yeah, I got slow

638
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,120
Well, it's the middle of the week and it's the beetles. She's leaving home. She's leaving home, right?

639
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Wednesday morning

640
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,480
She beetles in a row. This one was from Lady Madonna

641
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
What was Friday?

642
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,920
A bad time in the stock market but still he danced things about black Friday

643
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,480
I would have I wouldn't have known that I would not have known that when he was even if I could hear it

644
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,200
I would have chosen easy beats Friday at my mind to make it easier for me, of course

645
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,520
Oops, come on come back. What happened there?

646
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,200
Whoa did something just hello?

647
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Hello

648
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,000
And if you got this far you probably read about it in the Sunday paper

649
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,240
That's the trick you had. I'm hoping you had a good time with it and that actually soon take care

650
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,240
All right Howard you got me that was tough though. That was tough

651
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Okay

652
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,800
Let's get rid of that

653
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,160
What are we at? 36 minutes. I have so much more to do but I did promise it Thursday, trivia day so

654
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,480
Because what I want to still want to talk about is lyrics on MP3 players

655
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,840
I have another I don't see so I have some promos

656
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,960
I want to talk well, let me just move all this stuff to tomorrow's show because I'm never going to get through it

657
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,360
I also want to talk about audio hijack pro

658
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,120
Let me just put all that down for tomorrow's show

659
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,120
All done

660
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,800
Copying and pasting stuff then we have one final

661
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,120
trivia quiz that we can get to today for Thursday, trivia day

662
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,400
Adam this is Simon Strong out in Fort Collins, Colorado got a

663
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,040
interesting idea here for trivia game that that you might enjoy and the listeners

664
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,080
So I'm going to read the lyrics from the song and you have to guess what song it's from

665
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,200
You know, you need more cowbell to go with that reverb

666
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
answers at the end

667
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
So here we go first song

668
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,400
Steve walks where Lee down the street with the brim pulled way down low

669
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,000
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet

670
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Machine guns ready to go

671
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Steve walks down

672
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Let's do tough for me, man

673
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,200
Dude, this is really hard

674
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,600
And number three, this is my favorite song actually

675
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,320
Okay

676
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,760
