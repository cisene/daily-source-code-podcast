00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Daily source code, episode 189

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay everyone, quiet everyone, simmer down, simmer down.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I just want to say thank you for all the hard work you've done.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We couldn't have done it without you.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, quiet, static check, light, ready, sound, sound, boom man, ready.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Is that a mint position?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Ready? Okay, 10 seconds people.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's do this right.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Five, four, three, two, cue music, lights up.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's do this right now.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen, for many years us and announcer,

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
it has been my privilege to introduce a number of very important people.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But never have I felt the pride that is glowing within me today

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
as I introduced the gracious and beloved star of our show.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes ladies and gentlemen, it gives me extreme pleasure

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to present to you a man whose very benevolence has earned for him

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the admiration, respect and everlasting love of millions.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And here he is!

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey everybody, it is June 6th 2005.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Welcome to the source code.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And this show is created entirely on the cast blaster.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We're on data number 14 right now.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So things could go a little bit of rye.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hold on, let me just lower the microphone a little bit

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
to make sure we don't overmodulate which seems to be the biggest problem

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
on the crap.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, I think we're good to go.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Man, a lot of cool changes in the software.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, so we've got automatic ducking on,

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
which means that the minute you hit the talk button,

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the music starts to fade down a little bit.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Which now actually has a shortcut by hitting the space bar

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
it turns on or it turns off.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You see, so that's on, and that's on, and then it was off.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay, so we've got to figure out the ducking system here.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But at least it's working, and there's lots of cool features

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
which we'll talk about on today's source code.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, so one of the first things I noticed

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
is that the headphone monitor is really soft, but man,

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I gotta tell you, I've been talking to Mike,

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
who's the lead developer on cast blaster.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Just understanding the inner workings of windows

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and the way it handles sound is, man,

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that's a whole education by itself, that's pretty twisted.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No mash up today, although I do have a cool pod safe music track.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Which is from Iraq, so it's an Iraq pod safe music track.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I've got a couple things to talk about, and of course we've got

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
all the effects are loaded up.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I love the standard effects that come with,

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
this is just fantastic hold on a second.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, one I think is probably better is if I just raise up the level

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
there, let me just check for a second.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, that's better, so I'll just leave it like that,

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and then I can talk over it.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't think the auto duck works that well.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
When you really want to bring the level up real quick,

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
like you just heard in the opening there,

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
when I do the power of pure intellect,

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want that to be highlighted,

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
it takes a little bit too long for the auto ducking to pop up there,

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
so I'll just leave it as it is.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Cool electronic effects though.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So I wonder if that was over modulated at all.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You know, I'll just turn the auto feature on.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There we go.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm going to keep this one relatively short,

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
because I'm not too sure of the quality.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The biggest problem being the sound card in the,

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
in the, what is this, a very tech tablet that I have.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Also, to make it completely fair,

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
what I've done is I'm using the headset

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that I usually use for Skype on the tablet.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So it's not the normal processing that you have on the,

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
on the big microphone through the big setup.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So please don't go emailing me saying,

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
oh, it sounds like shit compared to other stuff,

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
because, you know, there's no way that this microphone

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
can sound as good as the, as the pure SM7 does.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I actually had listened to a little test,

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and it sounded pretty good.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, I want to lower the microphone just a little bit more,

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
just to make sure that we're absolutely not over modulating.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, there we go.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let me just go grab my paper.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That, of course, is really nice,

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is that I can now walk around with this thing.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And, you know, I have the mic strapped to my head,

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
so I think going nowhere.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Here we go, sit down on the couch, perfect.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, so today is Monday.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a dreary once again in the UK.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What can I say?

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's what you get.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's supposed to be actually nicer

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
or the rest of this week,

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
but so far, no evidence of that.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let me tell you a little bit about cast blaster.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is, as I said,

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll lower the mic just a little bit more.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is beta number 14.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So we've had 14 versions to play with so far.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And we've got a lot of testers,

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and a lot of people have been putting in their,

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
their beta reports,

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and we've really gotten this most excellent features

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and fixes and stuff is really rocking from what I can see.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We actually have a little menu bar now.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
One that has says create,

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
which I'm looking at right now,

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
which is the interface that you've probably seen a screenshot of before.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Then we have described, this is interesting.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is basically the ID3 tags,

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and we now have a field for show notes.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Although, when I highlight the show notes,

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
field, the cursor does show up,

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but I can't type anything in there.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So, must be something I'm doing wrong,

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
or maybe that's a bug somewhere,

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
so I'll have to look at that.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I've got a picture in there.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, publish is a relatively new tab.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, because we'll just call them tabs,

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
where you can give your podcast a file name,

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and save it to disk,

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and also upload to server,

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
which you configure under the configure tab,

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and right there's an FTP server with a path,

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the login password,

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
so it'll shoot it right up to the server,

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and all I need to do then,

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
of course, is to create your RSS file,

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and that will be the next step in the beta process,

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
but I think we're going to concentrate on this first.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's kind of cool that you can do all the stuff on the flywall,

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
it's playing, by the way.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's see.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So yesterday, which was Sunday,

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
took the girls, Patricia and Christina,

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
who London's West End,

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we had not been,

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
well, we've been to the West End,

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
but we've never been to a show in the West End,

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and we went to see a classic,

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
which you may think,

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
at first hand, you might say,

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
well, that's, isn't that for kids?

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, just close the studio door here.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Studio door, the bedroom door,

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
converted to an office slash studio.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, of course it's for kids,

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and of course it was a matinee show,

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
so there were lots of kids and adults there as well,

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
but as you'd expect from a typical kids play or a musical,

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
there was plenty of jokes in there for adults.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Interesting to see, was it Brian Connelly,

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think, played the lead role?

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I mean, I have the official program here,

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
let me tell you, was that his name?

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think it was, he was really good,

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
great singer,

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
let me go cast,

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
cast in order of appearance,

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
no, we don't want in order of appearance.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Here it is,

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
yes, Brian Connelly,

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
correcticus pots,

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Tony Adams, as Grand Poppots,

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Joe Gibb, who was truly scrumptious,

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
she was great, beautiful voice,

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and very interesting,

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
the child catcher is a guy named Alvin Stardust,

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and Alvin Stardust in the 70s

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
was like a really,

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
which I say,

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
flamboyant kind of trippy pop singer,

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
who had a couple of hits,

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
actually he, he was critically acclaimed,

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
really, he's done a lot of,

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
a lot of TV work, a lot of other musical work,

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and so now he is the child catcher,

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and he was getting plenty of booze and hisses,

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and yeah,

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
so maybe it's a kid's play,

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
but there's a really,

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
you know, actually there are a couple of great morals

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
to this, to the story,

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and I'd have to say,

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
one embodies itself in,

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you know what,

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
let me see,

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
maybe I can,

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I was looking for this earlier on iTunes,

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
because the moral of the story to me

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
is embodying the song,

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the roses,

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
what is it?

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
From the ashes of destruction,

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
rise the roses of success.

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm just going to go to iTunes,

203
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and see if I can find it in the iTunes music store.

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Here's what happened earlier today

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
on a different computer,

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
on one of my max,

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I wanted to get a hold of that song,

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I wanted to buy it,

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and it wouldn't allow me to purchase the song,

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll just see the roses,

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
see if we can find it.

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Because my credit card is still built

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to the Netherlands,

214
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
shoot, see,

215
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
now I won't even show it.

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I guess because they don't have the rights,

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
or they haven't cleared the rights to that song yet,

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you can't purchase it if you live in the Netherlands,

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
which is just so fucking crazy.

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's all right,

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
shitty bang bang.

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And you also,

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
now you can't see what I did.

224
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I checked it out on a fresh install of iTunes,

225
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
that didn't have me registered

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
through my account,

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
which is through a Netherlands build credit card.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So it did show me the song,

229
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I couldn't purchase it by itself,

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
could only purchase it as the entire album.

231
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I wanted to purchase the entire album,

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and then it said,

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
oh, we're sorry,

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
since your account is linked to

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
a credit card building through the Netherlands,

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
we can't sell it to you.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And now we're not going to show it to you anymore.

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So that sucks because I wanted to,

239
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
at least play the little preview snippet.

240
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But you've probably heard the song from the ashes of destruction,

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
rise the roses of success,

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
which to me was a great moral to that story.

243
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Had a great time seeing it,

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and can't wait to take the girls to see another show very soon.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We have great connections we've found out now.

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You just hop on the train and go for it.

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The 35 minutes you arrive at Waterloo Station.

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can hop on the tube,

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
or really just like a seven minute cab ride,

250
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and it takes you right to any of the famous theaters there.

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And it was a lot of fun.

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We had a great time,

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
especially after having been away for so long.

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It was really nice to just hang out

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and do some fun stuff with the ladies.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Hold on a second.

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Let me do a little.

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
See, I've got that auto ducking on.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It sounds a little bit soft.

260
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I just don't have enough hands to control all the controls

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and cast blaster, or really only have one mouse.

262
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I wish I could have two mice to do that.

263
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A couple of things I just wanted to chat about again.

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm not going to make this too long in case the quality is just too crappy.

265
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're going to see it more as a kind of like a test

266
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and an a source code mixed into one.

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sound seeing tours.com now has a manager.

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Her name is Katya.

269
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
She is from Holland.

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I worked with her on a number of things,

271
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
including our reality TV show.

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And she just got back from a trip.

273
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
She went to...

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What the hell is she going Malaysia?

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think she went to Malaysia.

276
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And she is completely bitten by the sound seeing tour bug

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and she recorded plenty of sound seeing tours there.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She was so excited about the prospects of it

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
that she asked if she could manage sound seeing tours.com

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and of course I was happy to give that up.

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So check it out.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's the brand new sound seeing tours.com.

283
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Katya is managing that.

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And you want to subscribe if you want to hear all the

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
awesome sound seeing tours that are being produced out there.

286
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And of course, if you subscribe to the podcast feed,

287
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the RSS 2.0 feed, you'll receive those in your iPod

288
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
or whatever you're using to subscribe to these shows automatically.

289
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's very, very cool and look for some developments

290
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
as we move along with that.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I received a couple of emails from

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Exit50.com.

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It was that.

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It was names completely, completely looted me.

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Not have to go back and look at my Gmail.

296
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Actually, I will.

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I want a second.

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Let's do that.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
See now I can do all this stuff off from one screen.

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That is kind of cool.

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Let's see, exit 50.

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Now Gmail, you know it's great search.

303
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Andre there you go.

304
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Andrew coffee.

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's right.

306
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And if you go to exit 50.com, you'll see right there

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that he is promoting live from Iraq the 425th,

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
which is, I guess, the Infantry Division.

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He interviewed them because they have put together

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
an album of music that was actually recorded in Iraq.

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The lyrics are written in Iraq and it really,

312
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
yeah, it's pretty heavy stuff.

313
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The whole story is there on the exit 50.com website.

314
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And they have their own website, which is www.425.com.

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's see if there's any info I can read.

316
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It has made a couple.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay, so I'm seeing here fresh off the press live from Iraq.

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Makes the front page of the killing daily Harold.

319
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay.

320
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, I think they should get a little more,

321
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
a little more press than that.

322
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You can actually buy the album.

323
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It is shipping now.

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I was fortunate enough to receive a track,

325
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
which I want to share with you now.

326
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's pretty much a wrap album.

327
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But again, created in Iraq by the 425th Infantry Division.

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And let me just check and see if that's Infantry Division.

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't really have the website as cool,

330
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
but it doesn't have like an about.

331
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Let me see.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let's see what the article says in the Colleen Daily Harold.

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That'll be interesting.

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Fort Hood troops tell a soldier story.

335
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, waging a verbal war in the first wrap album is the headline.

336
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Title is live from Iraq.

337
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let's go right to it.

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And let's play the fourth track off of that CD,

339
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
which you can also purchase at CDBaby.com.

340
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This is titled Holding My Breath.

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I can feel myself dying.

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
To norm it, I might as it's in my lungs.

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
For maybe I'm tired.

344
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Maybe it's time for me to breathe in.

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And I can never let you see.

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And it made me an empire.

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No matter how soon I breath I can.

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Because I let it show.

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So let's know what times help me.

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I really get.

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And I'm trying to be strong.

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're both the lesson.

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You hold on for the focus.

354
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I held on.

355
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And I hold my breath for the focus.

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's too much on my show.

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's here.

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I just can't hope it.

359
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No one does smile to corner.

360
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And I'm standing so close to them.

361
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's the closest show to my most.

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But it's me calling my focus.

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And we have a new mind like humans,

364
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
that I have no control.

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And we need to come over here.

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No matter how soon I breath I can.

367
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I can't be sure of it.

368
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And I can never let you see.

369
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And it made me an empire.

370
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So let's see.

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000

Now let's.

So let's see.

496
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So let's see.

497
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So let's see.

498
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And let's see.

499
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So let's see.

500
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So let's see.

501
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So let's see.

502
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So let's see.

503
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So let's see.

504
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So let's see.

505
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Let's see.

506
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And let's see.

507
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,760
stuff. So I'm liking this. The cast blaster is, it's work and it's not exactly the type of

508
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,000
sound that I'd like, but of course this is the basic setup that anyone should be able to use

509
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,440
with a computer and with a headphone and a microphone jack and at least a headset or you could

510
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,360
use a separate microphone. You could probably use a USB microphone. Actually I don't even know if you

511
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,440
could use a USB microphone. That's something I don't have to write that down. Make sure we test that out.

512
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,440
And it's really completely mobile on the fly. It has all your stuff in there so I'm really

513
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:55,120
digging it. This is cool. The two other things I need to mention, the podcast specification

514
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:05,840
working group, PSWG, who you can find at pswg.blogspot.com, seem to have come to consensus on

515
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,080
one click subscriptions. And Andrew Grummet, who was one of the iPod or lemon developers,

516
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,880
had an announcement about that on his weblog Grummet.net. Of course all of this will be in the

517
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,720
in the show notes if today's podcast at dailysourcecode.com as well as at www.curry.com.

518
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm not quite sure how it works. In fact, it's very confusing to me. All I care about is, hey,

519
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
it appears to be working or they have some consensus on how they want to do it.

520
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
And there seem to be some interim steps. So if you're not a technologist, you should be able to

521
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,240
set this up and make it work. But it's funny because it includes a version of the atom ATOM,

522
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,680
atom specification. And I guess it, it'll download a little thing to your desktop and then it will

523
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,640
automatically subscribe you to whatever iPod or aggregator you're using that understands this.

524
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,240
So it seems like there's like there's a lot of work involved to get it up and rolling, but it doesn't

525
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,600
matter because of, you know, I'm just looking at their website now, how many different aggregator

526
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:25,040
and iPod or developers have joined the pswg, cpodraiser, audio blog.com, podcast 411, portlet dev,

527
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:34,160
castfire, podster.de, libson. So it looks like everybody's in there. So that's good.

528
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,920
If everyone's in there, everyone's going to support this and not know fantastic. I did read on the

529
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,520
iPod or developers list now that there seem to be some confusion about, you know, the consensus on this,

530
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,880
whatever, you know, the minute it's working, you know, show me, help me and you know, I'll be happy to

531
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,840
put any kind of links or anything on my website to get people comfortable with the idea if we actually

532
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,880
have a solution, I would love it. I don't quite understand how it works, but then again, I'm just

533
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,920
the disjockey, right? What else did I want to talk about? I want to talk about Google's site map,

534
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:18,800
another great technical development that I understand very little about. Apparently you can set up your

535
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:27,440
you can set up a file. Boy, let me see if I get this right. You can take your weblog and you can create a

536
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,880
file, an XML file, which seems kind of strange because I think I'm already creating an XML file,

537
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:42,880
namely an RSS file, but they want a new type of XML file that Google can then index, you can tell Google,

538
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,920
okay, here's the XML version of my site, the more I think about it, the crazier it sounds,

539
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:56,080
that it's not just an RSS file, which already is created by every weblog in the world almost and

540
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
is automatic. So I guess now we have to have new functionality baked into our weblogging software

541
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,600
to create this new Google site map XML file. Whenever that changes, then instead of traversing

542
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,200
through your entire site, Google will read just that one file, I guess pick up any differences and

543
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,040
we'll know what to index, which is a fantastic, it makes so much sense. I mean, it really does.

544
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,760
But of course, I have no idea how to make this file. Yeah, there's all kinds of

545
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:32,800
unix programs and sources available to do that. I was thinking, would it be interesting if you could

546
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:40,000
create like a converter that would convert either your RSS feed to this new site map file,

547
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,280
or maybe even better an OPML file that you could then convert to this site map file because

548
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,880
that would make directories indexable as well, almost immediately, and wouldn't be cool to have

549
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,560
places like podcastali and iPotter.org and other OPML based directories automatically indexed by Google

550
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:05,600
and those reflections, those changes reflected the minute that they're changed and that Google

551
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
would know about them and would be searchable. I think they'll be fantastic. So, call out to all

552
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,760
the developers out there to see if they can hook us up with that. 23, 24 minutes into the show right now.

553
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,800
I've been waiting for it. It was sitting in my email. I just overlooked that I guess, but what

554
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,680
do you want? With four and a half thousand unread mails, time once again for the hit test.

555
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,360
Three intros and three answers and this is intro number one.

556
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,480
Okay, that's one of my favorites. I know it very well. That is Kaylee by Meridian.

557
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,480
And this is number two.

558
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:05,600
Okay, and it's that Skype call there. That's Prince. I would die for you.

559
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,560
And the final one for today. This is number three.

560
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,480
Uh, two. The heat of the night? No. I want somebody.

561
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,200
Time's up and these are the answers. This is answer number one.

562
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,720
And that's number one. It's Meridian with Kaylee. Yeah, got it.

563
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,400
I should give myself a point for that.

564
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,160
Answer number one, Kaylee. And this is answer number two.

565
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,720
It's Prince and the Revolution. The song is titled, I would die for you.

566
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,640
Oh, yeah, another point.

567
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,640
Prince answer number two.

568
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,720
And this is the third and final answer for today's hit test.

569
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Number 40 by the way, so it's more than 120. I know the song.

570
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,760
In your hit test, Adam. That's a survivor. The burning heart of course.

571
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,560
A little boy.

572
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:31,840
The third and final answer for today. Burning hearts that was that was survivor.

573
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,840
Okay, that's it for today. I hope you enjoyed this one. Of course, feedback is welcome

574
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,760
to hittest.gmail.com and you can find information about this hittest.

575
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:49,760
And also the separate hittest podcast on www.yompolet.nl that's Jay and P-O-L-E-T.nl and also.com.

576
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,040
Well, thank you for listening. See you next time. Bye-bye.

577
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,400
Okay, young. Thank you very much. Like to like it a lot as always.

578
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:03,440
And sucked just a little bit as usual. Okay, that's it for today's source code. Thank you for listening.

579
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:13,760
I've got to crank this up a bit. That's the only thing I really need to have it just as I need

580
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,400
more volume on the headphones when I'm doing this. I can just barely hear the mix, which is

581
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:28,080
difficult for the way I like to produce the show. But it seems to work. Okay, it shouldn't be too long

582
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:35,600
before we have the cast blast or website up and we can go to a broader beta. Hopefully this show

583
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,080
turned out okay. If there aren't too many crappy bits in it, besides the actual content of the show,

584
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:49,360
with as it pertains to the technical production, then I'll just upload it as today's source code

585
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:59,520
189. As always, you can find the latest show, the archives and the podcast feed at dailysourcecode.com.

586
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:13,200
