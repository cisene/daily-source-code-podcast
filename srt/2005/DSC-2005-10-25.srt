00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Delta Sierra Charley 2-6-6

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,000
They're on your secrets.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Only information you don't get out of.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And I'm Korean.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It is Tuesday, October 25th, 2005.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
$25 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And hello, everybody.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Second, let me just adjust all the levels here.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome, it is, once again, right now I know it's going on.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There we go. Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's all that Apple stuff confused my mix here.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hold on one second.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, yeah, that's much, much better.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, welcome to the Curry Condo.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
On a Tuesday morning, it is bright and early.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's about five minutes to nine,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
funny to hear that transmitters.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We don't need those thinking transmitters.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As I look out the window, the condo is straight at the hills.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I see this huge antenna standing there.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
My God.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't wonder, I just think I'm happy that I'm.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't have to be more for that thing.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Come in to you through iPods, MP3 players,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and computers everywhere.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Your daily source code for the next 15 minutes.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
On safe tunes, promos.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A little bit woozy this morning.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We had a nice dinner last night to folks were up in San Francisco.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Actually, one was up from Los Angeles, Julia.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm pretty sure I've told you about Julia.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And Andrew Grumman from the iPod 11 team.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He was over from Massachusetts.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm from Boston.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And so we had a nice little sushi.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
My goodness, the fish is still swimming around.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So if I were to say,

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
how could I get your day just popping off right?

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This might be just what the doctor ordered.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Something that a dog from mash up town sent me a week or a week and a half ago.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a mix that kind of starts out and like, well, you'll hear it.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a mash up and starts up in kind of this like 60's vibe.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But when you get into it and you hear the songs that are mashed up together,

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think you'll think it.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It is title just what the doctor ordered.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The daily store's code for Tuesday, October 25th, 2005.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't need one to stand.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What a girl boy.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What a girl boy.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Whatever they say.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Have a sense in the face of the time.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't need one to stand.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What a girl boy.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There's one at the time.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I would mind how it's so good to you.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right away, it's the height of the wrong view.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A cravings you never did.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And then I knew myself alone.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Baby, let's don't let it go.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We get the clowns like you should.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's how you know.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's for keeps on.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's for sure.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And you're ready to win and give me more than what a girl boy.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What a girl boy.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Whatever they say.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Have a sense in the face of the time.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't need one to stand.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What a girl boy.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What a girl boy.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What a girl boy.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What a girl boy.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What a girl boy.

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What a girl boy.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What a girl boy.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What a girl boy.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What a girl boy.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What a girl boy.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What a girl boy.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What a girl boy.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What a girl boy.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What a girl boy.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What a girl boy.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What a girl boy.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What a girl boy.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What a girl boy.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What a girl boy.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What a girl boy.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What a girl boy.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What a girl boy.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What a girl boy.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What a girl boy.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What a girl boy.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What a girl boy.

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What a girl boy.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000

What a girl boy.

What a girl boy.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What a girl boy.

What a girl girl boy.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000

What a girl boy.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What a girl boy.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What a girl boy.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What a girl boy.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What a girl boy.

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What a girl boy.

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What a girl boy.

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What a girl boy.

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What a girl boy.

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What a girl boy.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,040
What a girl boy.

122
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

123
00:05:34,040 --> 00:06:04,040
oh oh oh oh

124
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:34,040
oh oh oh oh

125
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:45,640
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I just can't get enough of these Mash ups I

126
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,040
no I know I know not everyone feels that way yo some people say I hate those

127
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,200
Mash ups I shuttle right passed and well that's good

128
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,760
because you know at the beginning of every source code you can just shuttle past

129
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,800
the first four minutes then if you wish all though I'm going to surprise you

130
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,880
and I'm going to surprise you're going to change that around once in a while

131
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,560
So yesterday, we had a little porn fest here on the on the podcast.

132
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
Hold on, let me just turn this thing on here.

133
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,920
Something I wanted to tell you about later in just-

134
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,760
Okay, I'll get to that in a second.

135
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,720
Wait, actually, I should put a little bit closer so you can hear it if it acts up.

136
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
There we go.

137
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,280
So I opened up the the power book box and we sniffed all the Apple porn together.

138
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,800
And when I got to the office, I do these shows in the morning when I'm on the on the west coast.

139
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,520
Because of, well, obviously, of the the time difference.

140
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,600
God, I feel so behind the world out here.

141
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,240
I don't, I, how can, how can a part of the country that is so technologically advanced and has silicone valley feel so behind?

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
It's just crazy.

143
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,040
So I got to the office around 11 after uploading and doing all the stuff that I got to do.

144
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,840
And I got an email from Patricia and now Patricia rarely rarely sends me an email.

145
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,640
Maybe to forward something from somebody because we talk every single day.

146
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,360
You know, so anything that, that, you know, that needs to be said.

147
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,880
We talk about it when we're on the phone call or on the eye chatter, Skype or whatever.

148
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,120
But the subject was like, you know, nerd BS or some Dutch equivalent of that.

149
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,160
Because she sent it to me in Dutch.

150
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,320
She said, oh my God, I can't believe you're getting turned on by a power book.

151
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,800
You're sick.

152
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,480
But what that means is Patricia is now listening to the show.

153
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,640
Something she has not done for a year and a half.

154
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,600
I mean, sure, I'd play bits for her and, you know, we talk about stuff.

155
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,960
And she's been on the show many times.

156
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,360
But rarely will she just sit down and listen to a show.

157
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,920
And I'd set up her computer at home to be automatically subscribed to the source code.

158
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,040
And I guess she really does miss me because she's actually sitting there and listen to the source code.

159
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,640
And hopefully, dig in most of it's a high on me.

160
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,080
Hi, baby. How you doing?

161
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,600
I'll be enjoying the show.

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,960
Hey Adam, I'm Mary.

163
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,920
And I'm Carla.

164
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,520
From the Mary and Carla show.

165
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,360
That's Mary and Carla.com.

166
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,320
And we have to say, we saw your latest video cast.

167
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,680
And we hope that we are your first video promo.

168
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,600
That would be really cool.

169
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,320
I would be awesome.

170
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,760
And we love your rock and pad.

171
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,280
You have such a pimping pad.

172
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,560
If you need two hoties there to be laying out on your couch,

173
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,000
we'll be the one there.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,840
We'll be wearing these pastoons.

175
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,600
That's all that we don't got a sexy one.

176
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

177
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
Maybe it looks witches.

178
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
We are two witches.

179
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,280
Well, we just wanted to say happy Halloween.

180
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,000
Happy Halloween and hope to see you at the X-Bow.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
Cheers.

182
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,640
Now, what you did not see is Mary and Carla dressed up as witches.

183
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,200
Full on, full on witches costumes.

184
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,840
Of course, I'm going to put that in the podcast feed for today.

185
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,080
So you can enjoy that on your iPod or just download and take a look at it.

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,120
They really did a great job.

187
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,520
And let me just tell you, I love witches because my wife is one.

188
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,480
She is a white witch.

189
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,000
That's right.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Because you've got the black witches with the black magic.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,120
And you've got the white witches with the somewhat less black magic.

192
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,960
And my wife definitely belongs to the latter.

193
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,760
And you know, it's, people always thought,

194
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
oh, it's pretty cool.

195
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,400
Adam's got a helly pad in his backyard.

196
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,080
That wasn't for the helicopter, my friends.

197
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,600
I was a place where Patricia could land her broomstick.

198
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,160
So yeah, okay, girls, we're great.

199
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,000
We'll see you at the podcast X-Bow.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,480
Very cool.

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,000
It's not the first video promo I've received as such,

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,160
because I have received other forms.

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,280
So this is really the first one that you even called it a video promo.

204
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,440
And both of you were on camera.

205
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
So very cool, appreciate it.

206
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,440
And hopefully you got the Windows XP.

207
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,280
My buddy from Microsoft was going to send you guys.

208
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,000
Seeing as you needed that to hook up the Samsung or something like that.

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,280
So last night after I got back, it wasn't all that late.

210
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,160
It was like 1030.

211
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,280
And I flipped on the TV.

212
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:48,280
And this, this car rove and Libby and bush stuff.

213
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,800
It's really complicated.

214
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,200
At this point, I do no longer understand what is going on.

215
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,960
Now I'm only just picking up the sound bites,

216
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,440
which of course is horrible, and the sound by pretty much these days is,

217
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,440
well, so a perjury isn't illegal if they aren't indicted,

218
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,120
but perjury is breaking the law, but it isn't really.

219
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
And it's just confusing me.

220
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,920
What is going on?

221
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,640
And so what happens?

222
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,720
What happens if the president's advisors

223
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,880
are indicted, and lots of people will be resigning.

224
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,400
And I guess Harriet Myers will probably decline the nomination

225
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,360
to the Supreme Court.

226
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,920
Well, then what?

227
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
Who's next in line?

228
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,600
Who's going to, we need some guys somewhere,

229
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,480
or some woman to stand up and take charge.

230
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,640
And I'd love to hear your feedback on that.

231
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,360
We haven't done any real political stuff on the source code recently.

232
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,600
And that's basically because it's all been about the same topics on television.

233
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,880
And now I'm at the point where I don't even know if

234
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,840
the reporter who was thrown in jail, I forget her name.

235
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,480
Susan, I think.

236
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
I don't even know if she's on the up and up anymore.

237
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,920
It's so confusing.

238
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,600
What is the true story?

239
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,320
Who can just give me the facts on one paragraph?

240
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,560
And please don't write it, send it in as a,

241
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,240
let's get some audio feedback on this.

242
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,960
Let's get going and understand what's happening,

243
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
so we can open up a dialogue.

244
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,600
Because to me, it seems like everyone is just kind of,

245
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,240
you know, slapped back by this whole happening.

246
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,440
And it's just kind of like, okay, I guess it's kind of going,

247
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,240
it's course.

248
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,040
Except for John Stewart, of course.

249
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,480
I finally caught a new episode of the Daily Show last night.

250
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,400
Man, I guys, good.

251
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,160
He really is.

252
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,920
And it's the same John Stewart that was doing the John Stewart show.

253
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,880
God, like, 10 years ago, it's the same stuff.

254
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,160
It's exactly the same stuff.

255
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,960
Only now he has the outlet and it's being recognized,

256
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,000
and that's extremely cool.

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,840
So let's, let's get our own dialogue going here,

258
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,960
because we really haven't talked about,

259
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,640
you have listened to Madge.

260
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,800
Madge does a lot of, you know,

261
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,160
does a lot of political stuff.

262
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,760
But sometimes she winds up reading,

263
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,400
like, you know, complete articles,

264
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,480
and that's just boars me to, you hear that, Madge,

265
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,680
you bore me to tears with that.

266
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,000
I want the angry Madge back who has her own opinion,

267
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,760
it isn't reading other people's stuff.

268
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,720
And it just realized that I haven't even put in a

269
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,960
a pod-sake music track for today's show,

270
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,400
so I'm going to pull out a while,

271
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,760
I'll play the next two promos.

272
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,440
I'm going to pull out some good stuff,

273
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,320
some stuff that we've played previously,

274
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,800
pod-sake music, because that's one thing that I have noticed.

275
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,600
I wind up choosing pretty much a new pod-sake music track

276
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,080
every single day, but that really doesn't help the artist

277
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,880
just to play in once.

278
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,000
We've got to play him a couple of times.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,360
So I'll look for that and you'll listen to this.

280
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,240
Everybody, how you doing?

281
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,760
Yeah, that's a fun day.

282
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm afraid that something I cannot allow to happen.

283
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is not radio.

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,360
It's podcasting.

285
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,240

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,440

What's the podcast that delivers all these things?

297
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,880
Um, um, what is going deep with the parallelizer

298
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,960
Fucking crap!

299
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
You just want to please the description too.

300
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,840
Go and deep with the parallelizer, Mr. Clean.

301
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, and the parallelizer.com.

302
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,480
I like to vote donuts.

303
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,360
Okay, I guess you'll have to wait for the show notes to figure out what that was about.

304
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,560
This is the Daily Source Code playing

305
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
absolutely the best and pod save music

306
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,760
there is to be found.

307
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,640
This is the singing waiter from New York, my buddy,

308
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,240
Brother Love.

309
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,920
And when we get our unlabeled going,

310
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,520
we're just gonna be the first guy I saw.

311
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,320
Someone else doesn't get to it before me, God damn it.

312
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,040
There she goes. Brother Love on the source code.

313
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,000
Hit it by brother.

314
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,720
It's alright when it's okay.

315
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,360
Yeah, you never saw that anybody else says,

316
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,320
such a stuff that want to think I'm in love with you.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,720
Come on.

318
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,920
Your size is sweet and little on it.

319
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,040
Your smile is the least in the love me.

320
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,120
Just that guy.

321
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,120
We're going to start.

322
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,280
I don't want we can do it.

323
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,640
Yeah, I go.

324
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,600
And yeah, I've been told I can't win.

325
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,280
So there it is.

326
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,640
First you sing you can't.

327
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,160
Well, let me say you can't.

328
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,880
You don't want to take it's hands.

329
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,920
Well, my name is hilarious.

330
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,320
I'm a laborer.

331
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,360
I must be the biggest sucker.

332
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,040
The status of the bill.

333
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,400
Believe in me.

334
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,240
This guy was, this guy was,

335
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,400
this guy was, this guy was,

336
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,160
when she goes, no one knows.

337
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,320
Oh, oh, man she's bad.

338
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,800
And I should know that she'll be back again.

339
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,160
This guy was, this guy was,

340
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,960
when she goes again.

341
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

342
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,480
So there it is.

343
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,160
This guy was, so it is.

344
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,600
So there it is, so there it is, she died.

345
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,040
She died to tell the story.

346
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,080
Oh

347
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
She died to tell the story.

348

Yeah, yeah, it's not I'm about to laugh

00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I know you need a lot of faith

355
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,280
I'm at myże choose a place when you think of your mind

356
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,280
We go red I was going, go pandas with each edge

357
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm like a candle, not a candle, not a candle, not a candle

358
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,940
But I told you that you got my 으

359
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,960
No you've got my name on Bertiousuck

360
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,680
restore your brightness, i don't drink

361
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,500
Get it ya know, let's eat run

362
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,260
Let's eat run, let's eat run

363
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,900
Let's eat run, let's eat

364
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,500
Let's eat cuters

365
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,940
Let's eat cuters

366
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,980
Let's eat, let's eat run

367
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,320
Let's eat run

368
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:42,320
There she goes from the pod save music network music.potshow.com and I got lots of emails

369
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,320
still every single day people asking about music on podcast and what the rights are.

370
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
So here's the basic lowdown.

371
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,320
If you're new to podcasting and want to play some music, the best place to go to the

372
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,320
pod save music network because once you sign up there as a podcaster anything you find

373
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,320
there you can play on your show royalty free.

374
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Doesn't mean there is no license involved in fact there is a license that's what you sign up for.

375
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,320
And the deal is are just put their songs up there you can use it on your podcast

376
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,320
as long as you report it back into the system everything's hunky dory.

377
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,320
And you pretty much want to stay away from everything else.

378
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Although there are some other sites on the internet where you can also get pod save music.

379
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
I'm not too sure about the license is there though.

380
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
What you don't want to do is play something you purchase off the iTunes music store.

381
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
And let me just tell you about the hit test and the backtracks podcast because people ask me,

382
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
how do you get away with that?

383
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,320
That's pretty much under the fair use version of Doctrine if you didn't call it that.

384
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:42,320
In fact, ask happened to be am I don't even pay artists if their songs have been played for less than 90 seconds.

385
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,320
And so we kind of keep it under 60 seconds on the hit test.

386
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,320
And in fact, all it does is it inspires people to go and buy those tracks off of for instance.

387
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
iTunes music store and that really does work.

388
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:58,320
You know, and you just head over to yonpolet.com and you can find links to every single track that was used in a hit test.

389
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,320
If available in the iTunes music store, of course.

390
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
So that's how we get away with that.

391
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,320
And now that I've set up my new computers, now I still have my old iPod,

392
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,320
which has filled with my 6,000 tracks.

393
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,320
But even back to the Napster days when we could freely share MP3 files.

394
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,320
So I've got, you know, all the oldies I've ever wanted are on there.

395
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,320
But all my new machines, I've made kind of a vow to myself.

396
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm only putting pod safe music on it.

397
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,320
And really just for the experience to see, you know, how, how will it work for me?

398
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Is that going to be enough for the satisfy my, my musical desires?

399
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
And guess what?

400
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
It's doing fantastic.

401
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
It really is work.

402
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Particularly the G5 iMac.

403
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,320
I got to say, they've done it once again.

404
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,320
This whole concept of the 10-foot interface, which, you know, if you, if you saw the,

405
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Steve Jobs presentation of the new iPod and what I think was more exciting was the new,

406
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
the new iMac and that presentation.

407
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
You get a little remote control with it, which,

408
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,320
amazingly enough, it actually attaches to the side.

409
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
There you go.

410
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Of the iMac with little magnet.

411
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,320
I don't know how they did that without screwing up hard drives.

412
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,320
And it gives you, literally, it's like the size of a shuffle.

413
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
In fact, it's probably a shuffle case.

414
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Julia pointed that out yesterday.

415
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
It's probably a shuffle in casing.

416
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
As a menu button on it, and that brings up this,

417
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
what, you know, what they're calling the 10-foot interface,

418
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
which kind of turns your iMac into a huge iPod.

419
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,320
It has a very similar type of scrolling,

420
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
and, and clicking interface.

421
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
And you get your, your volume and your forward, your back,

422
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
and your, and your pause buttons.

423
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
But so I just swing the iMac around.

424
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
It's done the couch and, you know,

425
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
and stuff just comes in.

426
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
That's what's so cool about it.

427
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
It's, it feeds itself.

428
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
So new podcasts come in.

429
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm subscribed to a couple of XML feeds on the pod save music network,

430
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,320
which means new tracks by certain artists or tracks that are played on a certain podcast.

431
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,320
We'll come in automatically into into the system.

432
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Video podcasts, which we're very well.

433
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Oh, man.

434
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Father Roderick did another Catholic minute.

435
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,320
He's really on the forefront of experimenting with, you know,

436
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
what you can do.

437
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
He took a train ride to France and documented the whole thing.

438
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
It's only like two or three minutes,

439
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
very, very good.

440
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Go to CatholicInsider.com to find out how to subscribe to the Catholic minute.

441
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,320
And, and what's happening is my machine is turning into just this really

442
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,320
fun device that always has something new for me, you know,

443
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
and you just sit on the couch and use the remote control and click it.

444
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
And of course, I've got to hooked up to the,

445
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
MM50 Logitech speakers.

446
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
So it fills the, the condo nicely.

447
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,320
And I'm really enjoying this.

448
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
And, and as I've been hinting at,

449
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
we're going to be coming out with,

450
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,320
what the unlabel, because just as everything else has turned upside down on,

451
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,320
it's head broadcasting has been completely turned around.

452
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
So we'll, the music industry,

453
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
we're already proving that with the pod safe music network,

454
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
creating our own superstars,

455
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
right in our own, in our own world and it's,

456
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
and it's like an oil spill.

457
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
You know, it's spreading out all over the world.

458
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,320
People everywhere talking about the pod safe music vibe.

459
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,320
And so, of course, the next logical step is the unlabel.

460
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
And what is that?

461
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Well, we've got some ideas.

462
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
And I think that within the next month or so,

463
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,320
we'll be announcing ways that anyone can participate

464
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
in the unlabel concept.

465
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Oh, we were talking about it earlier.

466
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Okay.

467
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Madge has something to say, hold on.

468
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Hello, Adam.

469
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
It's Madge here once again.

470
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
Hey, Madge.

471
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Listen, I have another boner to pick with you.

472
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Uh-huh.

473
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
This time it's about this video blogging business.

474
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Yeah.

475
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Now, you said, and you show yesterday,

476
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,320
that there doesn't seem to be very much good content out there.

477
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Well, did it ever occur to you, Adam's carry?

478
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,320
That may be video blogging existed before you found out about it.

479
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

480
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Calm down, Madge.

481
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Calm down.

482
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Uh, I've been video blogging myself for quite a while.

483
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
This is the first time, though,

484
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
that we have a portable device that it sinks to,

485
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
but okay, I'll let you have your minute here.

486
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Did you ever think of that for a change?

487
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
Christ's sake.

488
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Anyway, I want to tell you that there are some wonderful sights,

489
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,320
and wonderful feeds that I've been watching for several months now.

490
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
These, I'm going to tell you what my favorite ones are.

491
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
They are amazing.

492
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,320
You know, I like video blogs that are stimulating.

493
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
What is it?

494
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Is it video blog or is it video podcast?

495
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,320
I'm going to stay with the video podcast.

496
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
You know, because I think the podcast is,

497
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
can be anything.

498
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
It can be anything you can ship along with an RSS feed

499
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
to take into the technical realm,

500
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,320
but video podcast, audio podcast, PDF podcast,

501
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,320
all that is possible.

502
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Okay.

503
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,320
You know, it doesn't have to be all pussy and down

504
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,320
with the home boys and all that business.

505
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
I like intelligent work.

506
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Adam's carry.

507
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
And you can, you know, find your sense.

508
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,320
I'm put it on a webcam or whatever.

509
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
But here's what I like.

510
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,320
And these are really stimulating wonderful web blogs.

511
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
There are so much good stuff out there.

512
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
So don't start with that bullshit about this.

513
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
Nothing good out there because there's no titty porn.

514
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,320
And well, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

515
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Hey, match.

516
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Perhaps I should have let the audience enjoy your girdle

517
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
gazon.

518
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
No, that wasn't porn at all, my dear.

519
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
And fisting porn in all the shit.

520
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
Besides, it probably is.

521
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Anyway, bottomunion.com is wonderful.

522
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,320
It's a Dutch guy who is, well, he's American,

523
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
but he lives in Holland.

524
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
He is a very tall, good looking man.

525
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
It's phenomenally amazing videos that you may actually

526
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
want to grab a pencil and jot some of this down.

527
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
You know, this seems like a really long comment match.

528
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
I'm going to let you go for a little bit.

529
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
But I don't know if I can listen to another five minutes of your,

530
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
or your, you get to write.

531
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Just write that on your way.

532
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
So it's bottomunion.com.

533
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Human dog dot com.

534
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
That's human dash dog dot com.

535
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Somebody I have had here on my show often.

536
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,320
That's Chris Weagle moment showing.

537
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Is J. Deadman.

538
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,320
J. Deadman has been spearheading the vlogging revolution.

539
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,320
For the past year or so, he founded the video blogging conference.

540
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
And he works on fire ants and a whole bunch of other stuff.

541
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
Maybe he didn't find found it alone.

542
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
I'm sure Dave Wine did it too.

543
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Yeah.

544
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
I'm sure Dave Wine owned bed today.

545
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Everything.

546
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Free vlog.

547
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
I think it's free vlog.com.

548
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Michael Verde and Ryan Hubson are doing this.

549
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,320
And this is an amazing site where it shows you how to do video blogging for free.

550
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

551
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Madge, why don't you just make a blog post somewhere so we can read all those links.

552
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Oh my goodness.

553
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Well, put this crap on your own show.

554
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.

555
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,320
So, well, Madge just rambles on the background there.

556
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I wanted to share a little new toy with you.

557
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Hold on a second.

558
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Let me turn it on.

559
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Okay.

560
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
So when we were in New York,

561
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,320
this must have been about six weeks ago.

562
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,320
And we were presenting to Madison have new advertising agencies.

563
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Advertisers themselves.

564
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,320
You know, Ron and I were doing these little road shows.

565
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Talking about podcasting, showing the possibilities.

566
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Is Madge still doing this thing?

567
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Is that called the vlog of the day?

568
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

569
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,320
And so one of the agencies,

570
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,320
OMD actually was very excited about a new product that they

571
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,320
definitely wanted to promote via podcasting.

572
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,320
And it made a lot of sense to them because it's basically part of a

573
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,320
an item that is a part of the iPod economy, which means, you know,

574
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,320
it's like the MM50 from Logitech is part of the iPod economy.

575
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,320
And when I heard about it, wait a minute, what's Madge saying?

576
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
God damn shit.

577
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
As soon as that hurricanes of it,

578
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
this lady I love laughing.

579
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Okay, so Madge will just continue there.

580
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,320
And when they talked about it, you know, the first thing,

581
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
you know, we kind of all looked at each other when like,

582
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,320
my God, who's going to want that thing?

583
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,320
I mean, that's like that sounds just lame.

584
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,320
And then when I got home,

585
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
when I was back home at the cottage,

586
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
unsolicited Christina,

587
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,320
who I definitely feel is on the cutting edge of hip.

588
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
She, I mean, she knows what's cool.

589
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Okay, all kids know what's cool.

590
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,320
And she's not a kid, she's a young adult.

591
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
And she said, you know, dad will be very cool

592
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
as that is the eye dog.

593
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
And I went like, huh?

594
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,320
What do you mean that thing that I saw that we may be promoting soon

595
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,320
on the pod show podcast network?

596
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
And she said, yeah, it's this thing.

597
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,320
You hook it up to your iPod or who you hook it up to your speakers

598
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
of your computer.

599
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,320
And it does stuff and it dances along.

600
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
And you know what?

601
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Well, here we are.

602
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
We're a couple weeks further.

603
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,320
This is the Hasbro eye dog.

604
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
You can hear it's a shut up match.

605
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Let me see.

606
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,320
It's kind of a cross between, well,

607
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,320
obviously a cross between iPod speakers.

608
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,320
But, you know, the Sony eye bow, the robot dog.

609
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,320
And I had both the first and the second version of the,

610
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
of the eye bow, the Sony robot dog.

611
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Which was in, in a way, it was very cool

612
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,320
because it was kind of like a nano pet

613
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,320
for grownups.

614
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Only, it was $5,000.

615
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,320
Which made it all that less cool by the time you actually

616
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
were kind of done playing with it.

617
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
It was a very freakish type of toy.

618
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
Now this, of course, doesn't cost, this is like 30 bucks.

619
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
Someone who was in 30 and 40 bucks.

620
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
And it actually is.

621
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
It's, it's kind of cute.

622
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,320
It's a dog that has, it's in the same color

623
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,320
and kind of a nearing finish as an iPod white.

624
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,320
It's, it's small, it's about the size of a, of a mouse.

625
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,320
And what it does, it has a, it has all kinds of sensors in it.

626
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,320
So, if you rub it on it head, then all kinds of lights go off

627
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,320
and it's, and it's, in its head.

628
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Which it also does in synchronous air.

629
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
You should have seen this thing,

630
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Bob and to brother love.

631
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
It was pretty cool.

632
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
And then you can, I think you can,

633
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,320
it could, does have some of those nano pet capabilities.

634
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
And so if you, if you hit his tail,

635
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
that means that he's been bad.

636
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
And of course he'll do nothing after that.

637
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
But when you play in music,

638
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
and either you can, you can stick it,

639
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
they, they supply a cable.

640
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,320
You can stick it in, you know,

641
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
into your speaker jack.

642
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,320
And then it'll actually function as an external speaker.

643
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
You can put it, you know, you can attach your iPod to it.

644
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
So you can use it as a speaker,

645
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
but at the same time, the dog is just vibing.

646
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,320
And you don't, you don't just put it near a speaker

647
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,320
to work because it has a built-in microphone.

648
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
And I must say, it's,

649
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
it is kind of cute.

650
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,320
And probably the perfect Christmas gift.

651
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,320
If you want to give someone who's into,

652
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,320
look at his shaking, it's head and moving to Sears.

653
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Oh, that's what I'll do.

654
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,320
I'll do a video podcast on the dog.

655
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
There you go.

656
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Well, synchronize the dog's movements with, with some audio,

657
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,320
which, of course, it kind of does automatically.

658
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
But it's, it's probably, it's a really good Christmas gift.

659
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
If you want to know more about it,

660
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,320
check out the show notes at dating source code.com

661
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
or curry.com.

662
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,320
And just click on the picture of the, of the eye dog

663
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
to find out more.

664
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Let's see, 31 minutes.

665
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I'd say a little more pod safe music right now.

666
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,320
I've played this one before too, but I'm just so crazy

667
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
about what this girl is doing.

668
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Her name is Robin Stein.

669
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,320
This is Sweet Blossom.

670
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,320
My dear, I'm crazy for you.

671
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,320
I don't know what I should do.

672
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Stay here, or follow you on home.

673
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,320
I make him for a kiss.

674
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,320
I'll be a sweet tender lips.

675
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:44,320
I'll either have your start to warm.

676
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,320
Because I can't be around you.

677
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,320
And be with you.

678
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,320
If you refuse to come with me,

679
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,320
I'll go at a long time.

680
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,320
I'm waiting for a day.

681
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,320
When I can't find her, we'll see.

682
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,320
My dear, sweet Blossom, there for me.

683
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,320
I'll go at a long time.

684
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,320
I'll go at a long time.

685
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,320
I'll go at a long time.

686
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,320
I'll go at a long time.

687
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,320
I'll go at a long time.

688
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,320
I'll go at a long time.

689
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,320
I'll go at a long time.

690
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Because I can't be around you.

691
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,320
And be with you.

692
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,320
If you refuse to come with me,

693
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,320
I'll go at a long time.

694
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,320
I'm waiting for a day.

695
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,320
When I can't find her, we'll see.

696
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:50,320
My dear, sweet Blossom, there for me.

697
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Straight from the current condo,

698
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,320
from the 24th floor, San Francisco, Northern California.

699
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Robin Stein, sweet Blossom from the Podsake Music Network,

700
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,320
I got to hook up this eye dog to an input on the mixer

701
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,320
because he actually starts barking in rhythm with the music.

702
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,320
It's so stupid, it's cool.

703
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
I don't know what it is.

704
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
If it didn't look as cool, it might not be so nice,

705
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,320
but I'm digging it, I'm digging it definitely.

706
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
So Robin Stein, of course,

707
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
can be found at the Podsake Music Network,

708
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,320
music.podshow.com or Podsake Music Network.com.

709
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
And a little bit more about those music rights.

710
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,320
I've been doing some more research on exactly how licensed music is sold.

711
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,320
And man, I gotta tell you that it's almost like you're setting yourself up

712
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
for failure with this stuff.

713
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Look at these music services.

714
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
I found out how kind of the money flows.

715
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,320
So we know that on the iTunes music store,

716
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,320
it's 99 cents and the record companies are really trying to raise that price.

717
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,320
And of course, Apple will be fighting that because that's kind of the whole point of their offering.

718
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,320
You have this wonderful, beautiful looking device in many, many different forms.

719
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
And you can fill that up.

720
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,320
And it's a 99, it will basically buck a song to fill it up.

721
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
And now the record companies want to raise that price.

722
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Notice that they never ever want to reduce the price on anything.

723
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,320
And I think that Apple is probably making, this is not,

724
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,320
this is more guesstimate, but I do have some insight information.

725
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,320
They're probably making about three cents a song.

726
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Each time you purchase a track through the iTunes music store.

727
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,320
And I thought that the services like Napster and what else you have,

728
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,320
Rhapsody and Yahoo's music store.

729
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,320
I thought that that was basically a performance right.

730
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,320
You know, because all you do there is you don't get to keep the songs.

731
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Download and put them on your MP3 player, keep them on your computer.

732
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,320
And then when you stop paying the monthly subscription, which is somewhere like 20 bucks,

733
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
then the songs basically go away.

734
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Now, I thought that that was more or less done like satellite radio,

735
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,320
where you, they pay, ask at BMI for each song that is essentially transferred.

736
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:08,320
But it turns out there's a whole complicated mix of pieces that go to the performance rights companies,

737
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,320
like ask at BMI, pieces that go to the record companies.

738
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,320
Once again, the guys there wind up making very, very little money unless they have huge scale.

739
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,320
So, I'm just, as I said, it's pod say fall the way for me.

740
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,320
And, oh, keep those Christmas tracks coming to the pod sake music network.

741
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,320
I'm still looking for the, you know, a couple of quintessential tracks that we can really promote

742
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,320
as the Christmas songs.

743
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,320
We need some new ones, you know, I'm so tired of grandma got run over by a reindeer

744
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,320
and root off the red nose reindeer and here comes Santa Claus.

745
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,320
I'm sure we, you know, someone out there has some new tracks.

746
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,320
I know the Lee Harris 3 has uploaded like 50, 50 Christmas tunes.

747
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,320
I haven't listened to them all, but I'm certainly going to be playing one of those.

748
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,320
And if you've got any Christmas tracks that you deem pod safe,

749
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,320
just sign up to the pod sake music network and give her a whirl.

750
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,320
There, Adam, this is VT from the Gaming's Edge weekly roundup podcast.

751
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,320
I was just sending you some audio feedback to let you know that I'm totally jealous of all

752
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,320
your hot new Apple porn, such a fucking tease.

753
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
I dare you to play that.

754
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
But you know, I can't afford new shit.

755
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Apple porn.

756
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Anyway, speaking of Apple, I was curious to get your thoughts and maybe you can share them

757
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:28,320
with the, the, the listenership here as to the current state and future development

758
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
of the podcast section in the iTunes music store.

759
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,320
You know, that's pretty much become one of the major places where people go

760
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,320
to find podcasts and subscribe to them and such.

761
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,320
But it occurs to me that there are a few key things that are really missing from that,

762
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,320
that section of the music store in its current state.

763
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
So here are my big three.

764
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Okay. Number one, I think it would be really cool if they had user reviews for podcasts,

765
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,320
the same way they now do for albums.

766
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,320
Number two, I think it would be really cool if they had, you know,

767
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,320
just the star rating system type thing like they have for eye mixes that

768
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,320
users can submit for podcasts.

769
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,320
And number three, I think it would be exceptionally cool if they had sort of

770
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,320
back end for actual podcasters to be able to go in and see how many times

771
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,320
people are clicking on their their show.

772
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:25,320
How many times they're listening to previews via the music store or what have you.

773
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,320
And also if they're, if they're unsubscribing, if that data is being collected

774
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,320
somewhere, I as a podcaster would definitely like to be able to see it.

775
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Now, I know you meet periodically with the folks at Apple and talk about podcasting

776
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
and other related matters.

777
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,320
So I figured I'd drop you a line and try to get your thoughts on that.

778
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,320
On a totally unrelated subject, well, it's related because it's podcasting.

779
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,320
I just wanted to mention that gaming's edge now has two podcasts,

780
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,320
the weekly roundup, the one we've had for a while now,

781
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,320
and a new video podcast called Gaming's Edge Video in Pressions,

782
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,320
where we pick a different video game each week and spend about 15 to 20 minutes

783
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,320
going through it with video footage that is, of course,

784
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,320
a viewable on things like your sexy new iPod.

785
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
So give it a look.

786
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
Let us know what you think.

787
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,320
And by all means share your thoughts on the ITMS stuff that I just mentioned.

788
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Thanks.

789
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
All right, buddy.

790
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
VT.

791
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Yeah.

792
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Well, you know what's cool about Apple is that they say,

793
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,320
this is Steve's words, Steve Jobs words.

794
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
They say no a lot to a lot of stuff.

795
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,320
They really Apple is a relatively small company in comparison,

796
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,320
certainly on the development side.

797
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,320
And that's kind of the big secret is that all these big companies do have relatively small

798
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
development groups.

799
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,320
And I think that what you're seeing is, of course, Apple could do all of that.

800
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,320
But that's not their core business.

801
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
They want to sell iPods.

802
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,320
And so what they do, and I think they're very smart about this,

803
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,320
is they facilitate a lot.

804
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
And they leave a lot of stuff open.

805
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,320
I mean, without the, the iTunes API, the application programmers interface,

806
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,320
now I never would have been able to create the first iPod or to get stuff,

807
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,320
you know, that was downloaded onto onto your iPod.

808
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,320
So they do leave a lot of that stuff open.

809
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,320
And I think that all the features you described is pretty much,

810
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,320
what anyone who's doing a directory in podcasting or a place,

811
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,320
you know, creating a discovery place is going to have all of that.

812
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:30,320
But you're really talking more about some of the social networking aspects of podcasting.

813
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
And we've got our eye on that.

814
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,320
And our finger on the pulse, if you will, it goes from everything from,

815
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,320
you know, one to one podcast, nothing wrong with that, by the way.

816
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,320
You know, making a podcast for one person or, you know,

817
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,320
how about, you know, a happy birthday podcast.

818
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,320
Or look at Mary and Carla, duking it out with the tipsy chicks.

819
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,320
You know, that's, that's two to two, basically.

820
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,320
That's their tag team and we're allowed to watch in a voyeuristic mode.

821
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,320
The user reviews, the big thing, of course, is statistics.

822
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:07,320
That is the number one thing that has gone wrong with just about every podcasting initiative

823
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,320
or just a podcast distribution initiative that has cropped up.

824
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:16,320
And I think that that's something where a lot can be done.

825
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Because if you're doing a podcast, the first thing you want to know is,

826
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,320
you know, and if you can't get the numbers, then it sucks, you know,

827
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,320
and certainly the distribution partner that Apple is using isn't very good at,

828
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
because they don't do that themselves.

829
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
They're not very good at providing statistics.

830
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,320
In fact, very poor at providing statistics.

831
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,320
So that's a lot of the stuff that we intend on making better.

832
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,320
So I totally appreciate the feedback and believe me, the team is listening.

833
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Hey, you had a Mark Jensen from Potsquad.com.

834
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Not, not your pod squad, but this is, I guess, the Florida pod squad.

835
00:42:52,320 --> 00:43:00,320
And I hope you don't mind, but I had no idea that you guys had a pod squad before I got the name.

836
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:08,320
And so anyway, it's PODSQOD and I came up with it, did some Google searches.

837
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,320
And of course, after I got the whole site set up in WordPress and everything,

838
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,320
you know, I found out that you had your own pod squad.

839
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
So I apologize and I hope you don't mind.

840
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
No big buddy.

841
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,320
I've kind of kept it, but of course it is spelled differently.

842
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:30,320
So anyway, the reason I am sending you the voice note here is,

843
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Ray Lane, I was listening to the DSC.

844
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:42,320
And I heard you mention his name, and it's like, wow, I know that guy.

845
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,320
And I worked for Oracle Corporation.

846
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:53,320
And Ray Lane was probably one of the best things that had ever happened to that company.

847
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,320
And of course, he's no longer there.

848
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:04,320
I think he went on to bigger and better, but I just wanted to tell you you're obviously with a class act

849
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:11,320
and to tell Ray Lane that former employee of his says, hi,

850
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:18,320
from sunny Orlando, Florida at one of the super centers here right by the airport.

851
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:23,320
So anyway, I thought that was pretty cool that you've partnered up with him.

852
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:30,320
And he is a great guy that really cares about what he's doing,

853
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:37,320
and cares about the people that are working not for him, but with him.

854
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,320
And you know, he's just got that kind of philosophy.

855
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:47,320
And whenever you get the opportunity to work with somebody like that, it's really a privilege.

856
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Anyway, just a quick hello from not so sunny Florida anymore.

857
00:44:53,320 --> 00:45:00,320
We're waiting on the hurricane, probably just going to get kind of a windstorm,

858
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:06,320
maybe some rain here in Central Florida, but we'll see in the next couple days.

859
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,320
But meanwhile, people are kind of freaking out.

860
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,320
And I really don't expect anything more than a beautiful windstorm.

861
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:22,320
We went to the super market and water sold out people are kind of freaking out about that.

862
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:29,320
So anyway, I think things will be fine and hopefully not a repeat of what happened

863
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,320
to be poor people to the little bit to the west of us.

864
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,320
So anyway, Adam, hope to see you at the Expo.

865
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,320
Can't wait for the four and a half hour plane ride and talk to you then.

866
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,320
All right. Obviously, this is some feedback I've been holding for a couple of days.

867
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
I just haven't gotten around to it.

868
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,320
And you know, this one more piece of feedback I want to play just a wind up today show because otherwise,

869
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,320
these things just really run out of sync when they were sent somewhere they're being played on the show.

870
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,320
This is, well, this is from Dennis.

871
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Hi, Adam. This is Dennis Gray from 101 uses for baby wipes.

872
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,320
The aka the daddy cast.

873
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Yeah, that label kind of stuck.

874
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,320
Just wanted to send you some audio feedback.

875
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:16,320
First off, let me say thanks for all your help in promoting all of us starving podcasters out here in the puddle sphere.

876
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
And I really appreciate it.

877
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
I'm having way too much fun doing this.

878
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Frankly, I forgot how much fun Mr. Mike phone really is.

879
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,320
Now, my feedback is about three issues.

880
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:33,320
Number one, I'm really hoping that one of your upcoming dam announcements is going to be the official launch of podshow.

881
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,320
So as budding podcasters have a place to host our files.

882
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,320
You know, it's a double-edged sword. You get popular. You get a bunch of subscribers.

883
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,320
And then you can't afford the bandwidth.

884
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,320
My server right now is in a quivering puddle of goo over in a corner of a server and somewhere in Minneapolis, I think.

885
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
The second item.

886
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,320
But I'm really looking forward to more details on your promo additions.

887
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,320
You've really kind of teased this in the recent source codes.

888
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,320
And I'm celebrating all over my pod filter here.

889
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Could you tease us a little more?

890
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,320
But my last point is aimed at the podcast community in general.

891
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,320
You know, I'm finding out as I do this.

892
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
We have a pretty large audience.

893
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,320
And we have the ability to affect change in things that we believe in.

894
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,320
And I have approached several nonprofits for permission to play their PSA.

895
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,320
Since a lot of them are done by big name artists and I don't want to get sued.

896
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Just want to cover all the bases and make sure it was legal to play these things.

897
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,320
And to my surprise, all the organizations that I approached didn't just say,

898
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Yeah, but hell yeah, play them.

899
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,320
They're enthusiastic about getting their message out.

900
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,320
And I have approached charities that I support.

901
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,320
And I play their PSA's way of helping out their causes.

902
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,320
And I'd like to encourage other podcasts producers to do the same and support their favorite charities.

903
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
Anyway, that's it, Adam.

904
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,320
I'm a faithful listener, pod father.

905
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,320
Now I now bow and kiss your feet and kiss your ring.

906
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
Thank you very much.

907
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
I'm an evangelist for the podcast cause, really.

908
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
I believe in it.

909
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,320
And so let's get those 100 million listeners marching and get the advertisers to come with it

910
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,320
cause I really like to quit my day job.

911
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Thanks again, Adam.

912
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
See ya.

913
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,320
All right, buddy.

914
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Well, indeed news coming soon about the PDN and about those auditions.

915
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,320
Oh yeah.

916
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
And that's it for today's show.

917
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,320
Story.com.

918
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,320
Send me your feedback.

919
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,320
Podsafe music network is where you can find any of the songs played on today's show.

920
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Except for the mashup that can be found at mashuptown.com.

921
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,320
And I'm sure we'll have lots more to talk about tomorrow.

922
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,320
Once again, coming to you from actually today it is sunny northern California.

923
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
So take care of y'all.

924
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,320
I'm gonna.

925
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
That's it.

926
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,320
Only one bark for everybody.

927
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,320
I don't have to do the lighter click.

928
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,320
Another Pod Show Podcast.

929
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Stick it in your ear.
