1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta Shara Charley 2, 4, 3.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And now, coming to you from high-o-top podshow headquarters in beautiful Newark, Ohio, home of the world's largest basket.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here at home, hey!

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
6 million dollars worth of your place wrapped in my ass.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Transmitters?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Fantastic!

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's Adam Curry.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And it is.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What is it?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's Wednesday, September 21st, good morning.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How are you?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How are you?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Coming to you directs from Northern California, where it is foggy.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It is German.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Very, very foggy.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's your daily source code from Curry Condo.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I can barely see the marina today.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's chilly, but I'm back home kind of.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How are you?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You know, that home, of course, is a very relative statement.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is home for when I'm out on the west coast.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But it's, as was Ron's wife, Martessa.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, home is where the heart is.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, it changes with the time zones.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Back from Chicago, had a lightning round trip to Chicago.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We'll talk about that a little bit today.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And it's early.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's early for me to do a source code.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a five past nine, but we've discussed this, right?

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I feel so behind the eight ball on the west coast.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So the plan is on days where on the days that I actually am physically able to record a source code.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I guess I'm just going to have to do it in the morning.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So I haven't had breakfast yet.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I got up at seven, went through the email, which by the way, this is how this is how bad I have.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If now resorted to, basically waking up in the morning and going, oh, yeah, okay.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let me just check the blackberry for the email.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I sit there and bed.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Which is in some ways very efficient.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's kind of free to.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Scary.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Alright, to get into the mood and get everybody ready.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, I put the coffee maker on.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ada found another mashup for me, which is just freaking awesome.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I love this one.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's as he said himself in the email,

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
there's just no way that these two songs should actually be fitting together.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You like it?

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Should I stay or should I fucking?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You Tipe me.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, I love the coffee, but it's so much easier Grapes!

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But I'm never gonna let you eat me.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'd kinda stop it for the next week.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's here that I can lay my ass above baby.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You take her eyes upon me.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't run like such!

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And run the moonlight, don't run thegood time.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You should I stay or should I come there?

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You should I stay or should I come there?

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's my difference between, I'm supposed to be the devil's house

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The devil's house is the same

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There's space, I'm holding my feet behind the fire press

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm looking for a place to find a place

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't run away, don't run away

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't run away, don't run away

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't run away, don't run away

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't run away, don't run away

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't run away, don't run away

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't run away, don't run away

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't run away, don't run away

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't run away, don't run away

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't run away, don't run away

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't run away, don't run away

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't run away, don't run away

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't run away, don't run away

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't run away, don't run away

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Not run away, don't run away

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't run away, run away

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Stop theんだ

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Stop theんだ

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't run away, don't run away

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Dude, I can say it will be called

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Dude, Imma turn in

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't run away, don't run away

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's good before breakfast, should I stay or should I book gay right here on the daily source code?

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You know this feels so much like the old days when I was doing pirate radio

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Because what I've gotten into at the cottage because she's we were back for like what I was back in the UK for almost a month

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Which is pretty much a record for me

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You know I resorted into making beautiful outlines and getting everything all set up

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then you really do all the show prep before recording the show which is great because you're so organized

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But it does miss kind of a certain element that we used to have at the pirate radio stations

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We basically walk in you know five minutes before your shift as we called it and the previous guy was

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You know there was spinning his last records or whatever

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You might need even been packing up his stuff and getting ready to leave and just put the last record on

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Assuming that you'd be in there on time right

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then you'd dive into the record library which in the case of the biggest station biggest pirate radio station

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've worked at was kind of like a closet

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And sometimes there would be two or three people in the closet doing other things than checking out our records

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And this is oh man, I got an inch under my

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, I'm wearing my

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My sneakers

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, man, oh don't you hate it when you have an inch underneath your foot and you

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, man, I couldn't get to it

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, that's nice

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Anyway, so you just grab like you kind of know what your first record was going to be like, oh, I want to play that this is going to be my first record

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Which in my cases usually the mashup of the day if we have a good one

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then you just kind of free wheel it, you know, you play whatever comes and whatever feels right

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And so I'm doing a little bit of that and it's really I just I don't have the energy

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm wanting to to really go through everything meticulously

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I guess what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to have to find someone to help me out to create

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
To show notes post the show which is complicated because it has to be someone who's available 24 hours

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So the minute I'm done with the show, I said listen to the show and write down the show notes and here's the information that I got

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So I don't have to figure that one out

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In Chicago we

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We present it actually have a picture is great

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It was Ron and I do this awesome show if I if I can say so myself

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Where we have I bring the workstation we've got two computers everything's hooked together

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We're both mic we basically do a podcast and and we talk about

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Pod show and pod casting and opportunities in the pod safe music network and and how we'd like

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Advertisers to think about new ways of advertising and kind of break the mold of the 60 second spot

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's going to be a while you know there

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Still pretty traditional in many ways and lots of these advertisers are very excited

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
By the way, I've told you just before they're so excited because it's so hard for them to reach their audience

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because well shit, we're all listening to MP3 players and iTunes, you know, so our iPods

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There it is so the reason I brought that up is because this was the agency that handles the senseo account

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And we talked about it in depth, but there was like I didn't get all the senseo love I was expecting

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I was like okay, and here's the golden senseo machine

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So oops, hold on I got to do the milk froth hold on don't don't go away bear with me. We've done this before

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So the coffee's done now we switch the knob and

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Whoo

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We've got a lot of steam today

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do in my bird you'll think milk again come on straw rock

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Somehow frothing in plastic cup just doesn't work as well as in a crockery

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, so we kind of

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I was rather disappointed, hold on let me just get this ready and when we continue

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I got lots of cool stuff to talk about

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There we go

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh yeah, this is coffee

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's the rocket fuel of the industry

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay, so

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let me go my mic up again there

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Despite that we had we had a great meeting

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And it was good to be in Chicago I had been in Chicago for

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm gonna say 10 or 11 years

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I'm amazed at how beautiful the city is

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I remember going there before and thinking wow what a beautiful city

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There's lots of new buildings and the skyline we came in

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Was it Monday evening around a 930 10 o'clock from the airport

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It was just so beautiful the skyline was phenomenal

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And yeah, it's just

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Actually Ron had lived there before

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was one of his previous lives and he said you know the difference between New York

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I say this is so nice like every sidewalk is almost like a promenade

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And so yeah the big difference between New York and Chicago is the concept of

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Alice because in Chicago all the trash

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Goes out in the back alley instead of on the on the front sidewalk

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And that really ended boy doesn't make a difference

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So as I said it's like a promenade the sidewalks are clean

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, it was just it was just really really nice

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So got back late last night

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's you know Chicago is just a little bit too far from San Francisco

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You might as well go all the way to New York you know

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's maybe it's just an hour an hour further flight

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So let's excuse me. Okay, we'll do this and say a plug for that burp

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then I got in last night

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Kind of you know through everything down suitcase down

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But did crack open the laptop and I think I told you that

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Christina had been doing something with Martina

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Martina is Michael Butler's daughter

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And she has her own podcast called Emo Girl Talk

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And I'd wanted to get this a couple days ago because the show was already out

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But I guess you put it on a different server

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And of course it ran out of bandwidth within three seconds

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's Emo Girl Talk dot com is where you can find the show

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And I told Christina I said you know tell Martina to put this on the pod

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Show server so that you guys have enough bandwidth and you don't run out

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I listened to the to the show last night

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I want to share you know I'll play a little bit of it for you

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I was you know you think you know everything that your kids are into

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Right and what they're talking about and what they're listening to

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And boy did I get an education

193
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So yeah that was panic at the discount

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So Christina

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What kind of music do you like

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well I of course like Emo and stuff

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I like follow up boy as I like dying

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But for my valentine bright eyes

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Taking Max Sunday

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
James and Parker which by the way a really good band

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If you haven't heard of them check them out

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
www.jamisonparker.com

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And James and Comington's really hot

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So yeah check out that band

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Whoa

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She just mentioned five bands I've never heard of before in my life

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I was like

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Huh

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
When I get back to the London to the cottage

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I got to get an education in this stuff man

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
She's listening to stuff

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I have no idea I've never heard of when I'm very curious

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's heard

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I also like

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Just basically some rock and some Emo just so much stuff

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But you know when you don't feel the Emo mood

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Some pop music like Gwen Stefani

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Pop is our guilty pleasure

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Me and Christina

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah we're poser so

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Send us some hate mail

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Christina and I have

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Long time ago we came to the conclusion

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That we were the same person

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We have the same pass

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
When we were about like 12

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We thought we were really punk

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And we liked our little bit

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We thought we were out of the beam too

232
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We had the ties going on

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We're secretly a double person

234
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We're Tina to the power of two

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And so if you know we're like better than Paris

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The power of two

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We're taking over

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Emo girl talk dot com

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Fantastic show

241
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Some great music on there as well

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Just stuff that I've never heard of before

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So this is kicking me in the ass

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You know like I know what the hell is going on

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
First of all I don't know what the hell my daughter's listening to

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That would be one

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I never hear the you know she's she's got the iPod on

248
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So of course you don't hear what she's listening to

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Or you know

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
God knows but I am certainly missing out on some tunes

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So something a little a little note there to self

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Now what I've told you that

253
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've been using the blackberry

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes, it's true

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It is a crackberry

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It is freaking addictive

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The whole concept of push email

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Which means that you basically you're connected full time

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
To the network and when an email comes in

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It shows up literally

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Seconds if not the second later on the blackberry

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The keyboard is nice the layout is really good

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Once you have this got they've got lots of keyboard shortcuts

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Particularly in in the in the message system

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So for email works very much like Gmail actually

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
With the J in the K keys for

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Conversations and threads and

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I've I've certainly berated friends and colleagues over and over again

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
For the use of blackberries but I understand it now

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It really is true

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I miss the I miss the camera

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That I have I miss

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I miss certain elements of the MDA

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Which of course I carry with me right?

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I have that in my bag as a backup

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And nothing can replace

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The beauty of the GPS that runs on the MDA and all that stuff

278
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But just for and also

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It has a real sturdy feel

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You know it's like you could drive your car over this

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No blackberry is still good

282
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Maybe a little bit scratched

283
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And you you can drop it and the cover may pop off

284
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But that's about it. It feels good it slips into the pocket

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Nicely very impressed very impressed

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But also they've been

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They've been making these for like 10 years

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So you got to figure that once the executives got hold of it and they started

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Provided that I think that this device really was

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Built based on user feedback

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You know say hey if only could do this boom

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's that feature you know everything that I think would be a perfect feature

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Find it and it's in there and

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And the battery life is also

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
More than more than sufficient

296
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay so

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Of course what I don't have is

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The ease of Gmail's labels

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And I know that there's a Gmail mobile application

300
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But it's no good

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If it's not push email then it cannot compete no matter what

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'd rather deal with

303
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Searching stuff out later than you know

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Then having to log in and wait because it just takes time

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You know just trying to get your email

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You spend an average of

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
8 or 9 minutes just getting the email and waiting for pages to load

308
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Whereas when everything's on the blackberry goes pretty fast

309
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So I don't have the luxury of being able to tag something as you know for the daily source code

310
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So basically I'm saving messages

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That I think are going to be relevant for the show

312
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm going to be relevant for the show

313
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And I'm trying to navigate as we speak

314
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because there's lots of lots of little things that people have been sending me

315
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hold on a second

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Lots of schedules

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Lots of senseo stuff in here, lots of sound

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So this is a good one Samuel Fineberg said

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You know listen to your daily source code

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Heard you were hanging a mirror in your condo

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm not sure if you thought about it

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But usually I use earthquake hangers

324
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Especially when I hang anything heavy or anything

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That hangs over a place where people sit or sleep

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And he has a link to

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
To the ones that he uses

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's a very good point I hadn't thought about that

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I think that

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Well I really don't know

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I mean I hung up this mirror and I think

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The the wall fasteners that I use

333
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean they're not going to come out of the wall anytime soon

334
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But then again I've never been in earthquake and California

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So I have no idea

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If that you know how severe that can be

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But that's it. Thank you very much at a very very good point

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Um

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Lots of people inviting me to drop by in Chicago

340
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Which I'm in

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You know when we do these trips it's just no way I have time to

342
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Pretty tightly scheduled because that's just so much to do

343
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Here in San Francisco that we don't want to

344
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You know we just don't want to

345
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Hang around too long and you know

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hopefully in the future there will be more time as

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
As I move away a little bit more from the selling

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And talking to advertisers into the pure production

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And we get some more infrastructure in the production set up

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And we'll have time to do some of that

351
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What I did see as I

352
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
As I woke up this morning is there is an update for iTunes

353
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes five dot o dot one has been released

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And haven't been

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Been slamming anyone too hard

356
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But I've had some major problems with with iTunes since the 5.0 upgrade

357
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And these are the same problems lots of

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But predominantly macusers have seen

359
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Is that you lose all of your podcast subscriptions

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And only you have to go resubscribed to stuff

361
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I think that the engineers that Apple

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Or pretty aware that there were some problems

363
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So it's funny the way they can you have in the software update panel

364
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It describes what the update is. I haven't installed it yet

365
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It has iTunes 5 features a new and even more powerful instance search

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Including the new search bar which helps you find exactly what you're looking for in iTunes

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Or from among 2 million songs on the music store

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Folders for organizing playlist and new parental controls

369
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
From music music sharing and podcasts

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And here comes iTunes 5 dot o dot one features several stability improvements

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Over iTunes 5 so good deal guys

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sure you can stomp on a couple of those buggies and I will definitely

373
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Report back on that after I've installed it later today

374
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This week on the squad cast

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Two weeks ago we spoke with you about

376
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Hooking up the iPod

377
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
My brother-in-law and I tried to do it tonight

378
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We tried to do the old USB

379
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Securities and you still didn't get it

380
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What what what is your brother? What is his occupation? Why are you guys having so much difficulty here?

381
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He's a florist

382
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Who else makes color arrangements to subject of the five-minute diatribe and otherwise

383
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Handedly run podcast

384
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There comes a sign

385
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Nobody came to my defense here

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We all got really quiet after that

387
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I just sit down at the front myself

388
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Patience

389
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, they're hot. I told you I dated ones

390
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No, no, no

391
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No, we were talking about not calling them orientals

392
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You know that can hard on with a person attached to it

Content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother

400
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Are you addicted to race?

401
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Hi, I'm Jan Chow

402
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And I'm Carmen Vancouver of

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And we're co-hosts of addicted to race

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
A podcast about America's obsession with race with a specific focus on mixed race identity

405
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And interracial relationships

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Check us out at www.addictedtorac.com

407
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But then on the other end of the spectrum

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It seems like there are other people taking these tests

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hoping to discover some kind of quote unquote

410
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Ethnic background

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Because they think that it will bring my flavor to their lives

412
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Totally

413
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But really this whole phenomenon of DNA tests is ridiculous

414
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Apart from the fact that this scientific basis for these tests is very shaky

415
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
More on that in a minute

416
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's this whole realization thing that annoys me so much

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We always hear stories of people taking these tests

418
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And there are results that they're supposedly like 6%

419
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Sub-Saharan Africa

420
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And they think it explains all these things in their life

421
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Like

422
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh no wonder I was so into that Harlan Renaissance literature class

423
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And politics

424
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Or

425
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh no wonder it helps such big lips

426
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Or

427
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh no wonder I've always been such a great dancer

428
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And if you're feeling a little offended right now

429
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
By what I just said you should

430
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Because that is the point

431
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
These so-called realizations that people are trying to tie back

432
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
To their supposed black ancestry

433
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But pretty much always based on the worst racist stereotypes

434
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Stuff like all black people have written

435
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Remember that's injected two days

436
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
At www.andictedterraise.com

437
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So this promo comes at a very appropriate time

438
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because we have something to talk about

439
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Regarding race and racism

440
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Now I am not a racist

441
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I am also not politically correct

442
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
As you know if you listen to the daily source code

443
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So I call it as I see it

444
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But my parents installed the proper version of software in my brain

445
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And I grew up in the Netherlands

446
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Where a country where two million Jews were annihilated

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Ship often trains to concentration camps by Nazis

448
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I went to a very mixed race college

449
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Not for a long time three months

450
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But I was there my roommate Tyree

451
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
From Trenton New Jersey was black

452
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I actually pledged

453
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Kappa fraternity

454
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Which is kind of funny

455
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I was the shadow

456
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And I just I see no color

457
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I really don't

458
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But if I see someone who's

459
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
As we would say African-American

460
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He's black

461
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You're yellow you're red whatever the fuck

462
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We're all red on the inside

463
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Um

464
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So for me there's uh

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I am completely color blind

466
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But you see it you call it

467
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So that's not really what I'm what I want to talk about

468
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We have an issue and this is a community issue

469
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And I want to discuss this with the community

470
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
IndiePotter.org as you know

471
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Is a directory

472
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That although we as in podshow operate it

473
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
All of the nodes are maintained

474
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Actually the nodes the files themselves are hosted on servers maintained by the node managers

475
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So the content of that I'm basically linking to these nodes

476
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
If you look at you know it looks like it's all in one place

477
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Which of course is the point right that's that's the beauty of these OPML distributed directories

478
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And which means that a node can be added or dropped whenever you want

479
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What I can't do is I can't manage what's in the node

480
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Nor do I want to because then you run into huge problems

481
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Basically doing directory management and you need a big staff

482
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We have about a hundred volunteers maintaining these nodes now

483
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Which is the only way it works

484
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Um and usually

485
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
When we have some kind of conflict as an easy way to resolve it

486
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The conflicts usually are I can't get into the category

487
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The node manager isn't responsive

488
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Or

489
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
People say I don't feel like maintaining it anymore

490
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Can you find someone to take over the node for me

491
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And that's really it doesn't happen very often

492
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But now I got an email from

493
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The podcast shuffle

494
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And he says look I don't think that you should be linking to

495
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
This racist podcast and it took me a little while

496
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
To understand what exactly was going on

497
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But finally I tracked it all down in the

498
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Politics node which is maintained by guy named Mike Murray

499
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There is a link to the Goi Fire podcast

500
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And that is and I'd listen to it last night

501
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Without a doubt

502
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Um a hate based podcast

503
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So you know personally I don't mind if you call me white honky

504
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You know whatever

505
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But if you say I should die or I don't deserve to be a member of society

506
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Then I do have a problem with it

507
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Then of course on the other end you have free speech

508
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So if I were maintaining a node I would not put this this type of podcast in the node

509
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
By the way a daily source code is linked in that category as well

510
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
As a political podcast so I don't entirely agree with that

511
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I mean everyone has some kind of political statement sometime

512
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But this show is far from about politics

513
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So now the approach that the podcast shuffle made in email

514
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I didn't like because it was basically saying hey

515
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You know if you don't remove that I'm going to call you out

516
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And I don't think you'd like that if people knew that you were promoting hate

517
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa

518
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Back up that is not the way to approach this problem

519
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So that's really irrelevant I just want to get that out there

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So I listen to the podcast

521
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And it is something I personally do not want to be associated with but I'm not

522
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Indirectly of course we are because indie potter links to this OPML node

523
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Which in turn has a link to this podcast

524
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So I emailed Mike Mike Murray and said you know dude what's your take on this

525
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And actually let me just read the email because I really liked the way he responded

526
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Even though I may not agree with his viewpoint he said

527
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Adam was hoping that situations like this could be avoided when I decided to maintain the politics

528
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
node I knew that this would be the node that would have the most potential for controversy

529
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I also thought that it was important that the right to free speech

530
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
No matter how offensive some may find it should be given a high priority now

531
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I of course am so this is me Adam speaking I am of course someone who

532
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Finds free speech extremely important

533
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So Mike goes on as to whether that show belongs in the politics node

534
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I think that I question whether it belongs in the in the politics node

535
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because I didn't hear him talking about politics I heard a lot of hate

536
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Hate talk

537
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
He says I think that most people would think of white nationalism as a political movement

538
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Politics is a pretty broad category for example socialism

539
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Though commonly thought of as a political system is really an economic system

540
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But most would agree that a socialist podcast belongs in the politics node

541
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't want to get into a battle over semantics

542
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But I want you to understand the way I view this node so that I understand

543
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Here's the part that I think is extremely grown up that Mike wrote

544
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If you feel that this show should not be in the directory

545
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I would ask that you remove me as the maintainer of the node

546
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't ask this out of anger or hard feelings

547
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I feel very strongly about free speech and don't want to have to deal with removing feeds when people don't like the content

548
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Let me know if you need the latest copy of the node and I will send it to you

549
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So again that was a extra that's the way this is supposed to work

550
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But now my question to you is where how do we do this?

551
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
How do we draw the line?

552
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I know that personally we can do whatever we want

553
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We could basically get a copy of the politics node from Mike

554
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And we could drop that particular link and maintain it

555
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I could maintain it or hand it off to someone else

556
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But I don't want to. I don't know. I want this to be resolved

557
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Or I want us to have some kind of thoughts about how we deal with these things

558
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And you know at what point?

559
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Where is the where do you draw the line with free speech?

560
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Is there a legal definition? Are there legal boundaries?

561
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm not a lawyer obviously.

562
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Is there a line that could be drawn in the sand where something is just illegal?

563
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I mean if it's clear that if there was a podcast about

564
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And of course everyone used the same for an example

565
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If there was a podcast about pedophilia

566
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It would be removed everyone would say yes of course

567
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Because that's basically harmful to children

568
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But I think that all people are basically children

569
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And any type of hate

570
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Directed towards anybody is wrong

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But I would like your feedback on this

572
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I would like some suggestions ideas

573
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Clearly there's no conflict here because Michael is willing to do whatever

574
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And go with whatever flow and I really really appreciate that

575
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But let's and don't just fire off an email

576
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You know do your research listen to listen to that show

577
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And and help me out here because I definitely need a little bit of guidance

578
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And if I were just going to get guidance from my own conscience

579
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Or potentially from pod show lawyers

580
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You know they would say remove it immediately

581
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And I'm again I wouldn't want it in my note

582
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But it's not in my note but it is linked from our directory

583
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So help me out and let me know what you think

584
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Adam at curry.com

585
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Hi Adam

586
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
This is Cory over at the 501c3 cast

587
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A podcast for nonprofit professionals volunteers

588
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And all around do gooders

589
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
As we know Hurricane Katrina has brought enormous devastation

590
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And grief to New Orleans and the surrounding areas

591
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Over the past few weeks we have watched some horrible images of human loss

592
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But have also been touched by equally powerful displays of charity and support

593
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's important for all of us to remember that as the media hype declines

594
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The work of the red cross and other nonprofits continues

595
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Could you please share a few of these reminders with your listeners?

596
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Remember the recovery efforts don't stop when the news stories do

597
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There are going to be needs in Louisiana and beyond for years to come

598
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Find out what you can do to help with the long term efforts

599
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Also as the holiday giving season approaches

600
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Remember that your generous contributions to hurricane relief efforts

601
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is not a replacement for donations that you would normally make

602
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
To your favorite charities and nonprofits

603
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
As funds have been diverted to support the survivors of hurricane Katrina

604
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Your local nonprofits need your regular support more than ever

605
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Please don't forget them

606
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Also remember that all tragedies strike suddenly and unexpectedly

607
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Unfortunately there will be other events in the future that will require your help

608
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The best way to aid in these events is become a trained volunteer now

609
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
If you felt helpless watching the images of the recent hurricane

610
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And wish there was a way you could help then then sign up now

611
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
If you or anyone you know has a strong interest in the work of nonprofits and their stories

612
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I also welcome you to check out the 501c3cast

613
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You can find us at www.501c3cast.com

614
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Or by searching for nonprofit in the iTunes directory

615
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And remember if we keep working together it will get better

616
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It was born on July 15, 2005

617
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And now the seven headed monster from Pod Show Music

618
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Is about to make landfall

619
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Music

620
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Starting Monday, September 26, coming to a media player near you

621
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
See see what the hell are you doing man? What's going on?

622
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I don't even know what this is

623
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I can't wait

624
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The 26 I will definitely be tuned in with my media player

625
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Excellent

626
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Hey, so there's a big, big, big mega

627
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Music industry bash

628
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Taking place in Las Vegas Friday night

629
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It is a party

630
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It is a

631
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Dremaine de Priz birthday birthday party

632
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I think he has like the number one record in the country

633
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Now I really don't follow the charts anymore

634
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But of course I know him he's been Janet Jackson's boyfriend

635
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
For many, many years

636
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Who wasn't that

637
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And through Greg Lawley we talked about him

638
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
He hooked up with him after 11 years

639
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
He has set up some meetings

640
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
This is basically one of those

641
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
If you have a number one record in the country in the old school music business

642
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Everybody wants to be your buddy of course

643
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And it's huge and it's a weekend

644
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And he's throwing a birthday bash

645
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And he's invited all the right people

646
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He's a rat pack dress

647
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Which sucks because I don't have my rat pack clothes

648
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I don't know where I'm going to find time to shop for rat pack clothing

649
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I'm basically trying to get a hat and a cane

650
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And try and play it off that way

651
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And some gold cufflinks I guess

652
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And so Greg has set up a couple

653
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Because we talk for hours about pod safe music

654
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And basically there's a two way street that I'd like to open up

655
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'd like for pod safe music to be able to go

656
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Through some of the traditional distribution channels

657
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Which means and really is distribution

658
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm not talking about getting pod safe artists

659
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Signed up to record labels but distribution

660
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Distribution and promotion

661
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Which equals sales

662
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And I think that people who are serious about their profession as musicians

663
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Either you go work in a bar

664
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You play gigs on weekends

665
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Or you find other means to make money

666
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And the pod safe music not work as one way

667
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
With direct sales

668
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And through lots of promotion on podcast

669
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Which is fantastic

670
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And I think if something gets really popular

671
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Be great if we could have somewhat broader traditional distribution

672
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So that's one thing I'm going to talk about

673
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Some of these execs about

674
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And of course the other one is

675
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Okay, so what if there's a great song

676
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That is licensed by the RIAA

677
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Which by the way

678
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's the RIAA is just an association

679
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's the owner of the masters

680
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So it's the record label in most cases

681
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
The master

682
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And if you want to play a

683
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Traditional music business song on your podcast

684
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You have to have as far as we know at this point

685
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Because of course no one has a straight answer

686
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You have to have two things taken care of

687
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
One is you have to have

688
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You have to pay your ASCAP BMI license fee

689
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Which is not a huge amount of money

690
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But if you...

691
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Well it's significant

692
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I mean it's like a thousand bucks a year

693
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
At least

694
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And if you make money with your podcast

695
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You have to have a percentage of your gross income

696
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Okay

697
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That's fair

698
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Makes sense and that's a deal

699
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's been around for a long time

700
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But then you also have to have permission

701
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
In this case

702
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Because we're talking about digital downloads

703
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And that's a very, very fuzzy area

704
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And of course 99% of all record executives

705
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Have never

706
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Have never listened to a podcast

707
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They probably think it's playlists of music being played

708
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Not that

709
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
They have to have an listen

710
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So I don't know what's going on

711
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's like radio except it's our kind of radio

712
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You know what we do what we want

713
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So you have to have permission in order to play it

714
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And then of course you technically could

715
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So what I'd like to talk to some of these labels about

716
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Is

717
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Waving both fees if possible

718
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And again I'm not a lawyer

719
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But if we get some written permission on stuff

720
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Then it could be interesting to see what shows up

721
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Because look I'm not interested in playing

722
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Jermaine Dupree because the radio stations do a fine job of that

723
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And it's a number one song

724
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But I am interested in playing lots of back catalog as an example

725
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And I think that it's we know it results in sales

726
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
People go to iTunes

727
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I play that French song

728
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Schonce Lise

729
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
On was it Monday show

730
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I got so many responses

731
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So many people

732
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And it sounds from 1969

733
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's almost as old as I am

734
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And people loved it

735
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And of course I was in total violation

736
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Because I don't have the rights to play that song

737
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But it is a part of the soundtrack of my life

738
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And that's something that's really important

739
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I want to be able to mash stuff up

740
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Mashups is another blatant violation

741
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I want that to be legal and I want there to be an incentive

742
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And I want there to be everyone to win

743
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So I want to be able to add a mash up to the iTunes music story

744
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So the people can download that

745
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And also download the original tracks

746
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So there's a, as I said, big power

747
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Big power I'm going to go

748
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Vegas is great

749
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Because it's only about an hour and 15 minutes from San Francisco

750
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So I think when we go we have dinner with the guys from Deaf Jam

751
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And from Virgin

752
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And then of course

753
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Well, shocks

754
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I guess I'll have to

755
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I guess I'll have to go to the party

756
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Oh man, that's going to be so hard

757
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You know how I hate parties

758
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Hey, this one showed up on the pod

759
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Safe Music Network

760
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Two days ago

761
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Brand new brother love

762
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
There she goes

763
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
She goes

764
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So I'm shot in the so good to you

765
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What happened?

766
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
What happened?

767
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Don't leave it so soon

768
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's alright

769
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
When it's okay

770
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yeah

771
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Get it over there

772
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
So anybody else says

773
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Such a stuff and what I think I'm in love with you

774
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I come out

775
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You're so sweet little honey

776
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You're smiling at least in the love me

777
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Just like that

778
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We'll go outside

779
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I know we're willing to do it

780
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, I go

781
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And I've been told

782
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I can't wait until there it is

783
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
First you say you can't

784
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Let me say you can

785
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You don't want to take it's you

786
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Well

787
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
My names are there

788
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm on the road

789
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I must be the biggest

790
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I've got the status

791
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I've got the status

792
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Good evening man

793
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yes it goes

794
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Now this's

795
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
God knows

796
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Now this is God knows

797
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Now this is God most

798
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
God knows

799
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
To the world.

800
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Show me that you are.

801
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
To the world.

802
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
To the world.

803
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So strange.

804
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
How?

805
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
She back and tell the story.

806
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Oh, she back and tell the story.

807
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, she back and tell the story, how she told the story.

808
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Just tell the stories, just to keep it by.

809
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And I'm going to love you so, that's the first thing.

810
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
No, I don't want to be a loom.

811
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't want to be your brother, I don't want to say anything

812
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't want to be your brother, I don't want to say anything

813
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I don't want to be your brother, I don't want to be your brother

814
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I don't want to be your brother, I don't want to be your brother

815
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,980
Man you in place in the recib are nothing under the sun

816
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,000
I follow me, follow you, follow me, with no темers

817
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,180
This goes again, this goes again

818
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,920
What's going on?

819
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,320
I feel like I should be back again, yeah, yeah

820
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:13,760
As you go, as you slip, as you go is like it Yeah

821
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,080
You can't get away, you gotta relax like it

822
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:26,960
In your mouth is lied. I'll try to figure out

823
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,940
I know you don't really love this

824
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,940
I'm out of my mind, she's at times

825
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,940
I believe it's what you think of your mind

826
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,940
Go in, go in, go in

827
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,940
Come on and let me in

828
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,940
I'm not gonna get in though

Not up again

830
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,940
No

00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,940
I'm out of my mind

832
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,940
I'm out of my mind

833
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,940
I'm out of my mind

834
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
I'm out of my mind

835
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,940
I'm out of my mind

836
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,940
I'm out of my mind

837
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,940
I'm out of my mind

838
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,940
I'm out of my mind

Such a super.

842
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,760
Had no idea what you think.

843
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Left in love.

844
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,600
Bye!

845
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Grab the love.

846

There she goes!

847
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,600
I can't believe it did 43 minutes, even though I was planning to do like 25.

848
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,600
I just haven't too much fun here in the condo.
