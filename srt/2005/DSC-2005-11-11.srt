1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 277.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,500
No joke, this satellite radio company signed former MTVVJ Adam Curry as it's exclusive

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
PJ.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Amanda.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
What a serious?

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Yes.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,300
From the streets of New Jersey to the suburbs of the UK, this is the man who trains media

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,500
as we know it.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:48,500
And now, here is the Delhi source code with Adam Curry, Adam Curry.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,500
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,500
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
It is Friday.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,500
How are you doing everybody coming to you from the lovely Sheraton in Ontario, California?

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,500
It is the podcast exploitation of the Delhi source code kicking off with the guy who

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
performed last night at the pod save.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Hold down.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Oh, there we go, round again.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Shut up and taste the way it's looking better.

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
I never want to scun.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,500
It's a part of trip, but I never got out of the bus.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
I don't know if you do like I said it's looking better.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I don't know if you do when I'm never reached by your way.

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is never made.

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better.

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Left on there.

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,500
When I look up, it hits me like it's yesterday's rain.

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than me.

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than me.

30
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than me.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than me.

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than me.

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than me.

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than me.

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than me.

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I don't know if you do when I'm not reached by your way.

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Believe me, say what you will but this is hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:04:02,660
Oh yeah, we just have full pleasures that are eleven attacks, whatever they do, they just link them up and they will let them leave.

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,820
I'm so true, they're very worthy of, they take shit without the right.

40
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,760
That they hurts if their penetrating stuff will never push you up,

41
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,760
I know this is gonna be the same

42
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Say what you will, but this is better, this is better

43
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,760
So I'm live last night in the acoustic set

44
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,760
At the luxurious Melodout Mariah

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Can't say what you will for the pot-safe music network

46
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh, hey everybody how you doing if you're listening to us on serious satellite radio

47
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Channel 103 serious stars and you're saying what the hell is going on here

48
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,760
This is the daily source code the beginning of the the pod shows spot spot quad pod squad line up

49
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,760
As heard every single week day after noon

50
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,760
And I am in Ontario, California not to be confused with with Ontario Canada

51
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,760
And this is the place where this weekend the first annual portable media expo is being held

52
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Otherwise known as the podcast expo, although it officially is called the portable media expo

53
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,760
And we're here, the pod people are here and I witnessed that last night

54
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Let me tell you what's oh by the way you're hearing the I'm in the there were no more rooms in the Mariah

55
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,760
So I'm in the Sheraton where you get the sweet sleeper bed by the way

56
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
I'm just noticing that and it wasn't too bad

57
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,760
It's early Friday morning and that's the air conditioning in the luxurious hotel

58
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Sweet that I've been provisioned with it kicks in once every ten minutes

59
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
It's not much you can do about it just live with it, okay

60
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Got in last night actually yesterday afternoon arrived around four o'clock from London on on virgin

61
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,760
On the upper class got to say love the flight once again

62
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Although it wasn't a 747 this time it was an airbus and you can't fool me

63
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,760
The sweet chairs and it's just they called a sweet what you get your little sweet

64
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
They're shorter they're shorter than on the 747

65
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:21,760
But it was a good flight overall got a couple hours of sleep and was able to watch the movie that we had a lot of conversations about on the source code when it first came out

66
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Willy Wonka's chocolate factory got to say I thought Johnny Depp actually did a fantastic job as as Willy Wonka

67
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,760
But I did miss kind of the evil the back story of the evil guys who were trying to steal the tickets or buy Charlie's ticket

68
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,760
There wasn't enough of that in there, but it was good. It was a fun movie to watch

69
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:47,760
And I tried to watch that kind of like that dark you drama about Brian Jones gets called stone and I fell asleep halfway through

70
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Anyway, so got in and as you know virgin Atlantic has and this is not a paid endorsement

71
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,760
I just really love virgin Atlantic they give you a car service to and from the airport

72
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,760
And actually called him I said hey, you know, what if I have to go to like Ontario, California from LAX

73
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
And I said yeah, no problem. It's wherever you want to go

74
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,760
So Francisco drove me up out of hour and a half at that time a day and got in

75
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,760
And I decided to just stay awake and and wait for the pod save music

76
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,760
I called the pod save music hold down essentially CC Chapman and Craig Patchett

77
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Organized this this little mini acoustic concert in the Marriott

78
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,760
They and of course pod show chiptain and sponsored and there were several other sponsors

79
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,760
For the show and it was it was just unbelievable

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,760
And I'm going to try and throughout throughout the show today I'll try and explain why it was so unbelievable and what's so cool about it

81
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,760
You have to understand that I believe at least a thousand maybe two thousand podcasters and not just podcasters

82
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,760
But also listeners have descended upon Ontario for this for this conference

83
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:04,760
And I kind of walked in expecting maybe a bit of like a nom dex vibe or a blogger con or one of these types of the

84
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,760
But no way this is something completely different

85
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Sure all these people are still introverted

86
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Crazy black jobs like myself who are much more comfortable

87
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,760
You know burping into a microphone than anything else

88
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,760
But it was really a very interesting set of people and the must have been I think by the time Chan's gone on stage

89
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Chan's and brother loved performed last night when Chan's got on stage

90
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,760
It was filling up. It was like 150 people. It was a nice size room

91
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Sorry my eyes. Oh man. I'm going to put my lenses in today

92
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,760
And I don't know if I can be able to make it my eyes are not really participating anyway

93
00:08:46,760 --> 00:09:00,760
And you know so I walk in and it's like everyone wanted to say hi and and of course I met just about all hundred or 150 people who were there last night

94
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,760
And there were, you know, there were names that are recognized. There were shows that are recognized. There were voices that I recognized

95
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,760
But it really looked like

96
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Oh man. How can I explain it?

97
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,760
It was so much more of a revolutionary vibe than any of the other conferences that I've been to

98
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,760
These people are just unbelievably enthusiastic about what they're doing about the change that's happening

99
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:37,760
About the music that's involved man. A lot of talk about pod safe music and about my recent experiences with the RIA or the European versions of it

100
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,760
And just a really really good crowd

101
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Good to see and you know that I had never met CC Chapman in person so it was good to hook up with CC

102
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Who looks just like his character chair

103
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,760
You know for the logo for a show. It is. It's so CC. It's amazing.

104
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:04,760
We have a number of other pod squad members who came up for the festivities. I think the mommy casters are in town

105
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,760
I saw Chris Rockwell, daily download Chris McIntyre from podcast Dally and a lot of the music shows

106
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,760
I met Mark from the Tarton podcast Big Mike from the accessible access show

107
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Oh man. I met Trucker Tom who I've been a big fan of and been listening to for a long time

108
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,760
And it was great. There was an actual meeting between Trucker Tom who is this

109
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Well, I hope I can find this picture because we actually took a picture of me in between Trucker Tom and Madge

110
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,760
And Madge of course Madge got a new dress got a new hairdo got new shoes

111
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:51,760
And it was just it was it was very very different and you know take along with that that I was completely tripping on jet lag and you know and some other

112
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Some other things that seem to be circulating around the conference and it was just it was a big trip

113
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,760
So I got in around midnight and I thought about doing a show last night about so incredibly tired and

114
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,760
I thought that I wouldn't be able to do the show on the mobile setup

115
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,760
You know I have the the baranger mixer and the and the vocal processor

116
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,760
You know the setup that I tested and Brussels last time we actually that is that is that is that's the time before last the show before last

117
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,760
And as I'm unpacking it, you know getting ready to set up

118
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,760
I noticed that the power adapter for the mixer

119
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Stupidest thing in the world is only 240 volts to

120
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,760
What do I need here 12 volts on this board and I'm like oh man because usually goes from like a hundred to 240

121
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,760
And you can plug it in anywhere in the world and it just says right now

122
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Let me see if it's getting warm

123
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,760
It's not even warm. We'll see AC adapter. Yeah, it says PRI 230 volts 50 hertz

124
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,760
No, 50 hertz that's even something else because we have 60 hertz here in the states

125
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,760
I believe and it to outputs to 12 volts one amp and and I plug it in and guess what it works

126
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Although I have to say the lights are kind of you know kind of flickering and dimming

127
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,760
When I'm talking on the on the LED readout and there's a horrible hum somewhere

128
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
So hopefully it'll all just kind of hang together

129
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
But it is it is basically working

130
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,760
So as I said last night lots of talk about pod safe music and my recent experiences and lots of feedback about that today as well

131
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Adam Bruce Williams from audio to you dot com how I am

132
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I just finished the commute listening to DSC 275 and I've got to say I was pissed off

133
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,400
Listening to talking about these cock suckers in the Netherlands who think that you know

134
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Isn't it great the way an Australian says cock sucker a cock suckers?

135
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,760
No, if we don't hurry up and play ball they're gonna shut down podcasting

136
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Please this how the hell do they think they're gonna do that?

137
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
They're gonna suddenly make it against the Lord of being possession of RSS code

138
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Man unbelievable anyway something I wanted to talk about with you was up until last weekend

139
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I had eight different podcast channels running off audio to you.com

140
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Now the reason I put all that in the past tense is because three of those channels were supplied by a mate of mine

141
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Dom Romeo and Dom's just been approached by somebody who wants to buy all of his back catalog of interviews

142
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Basically all of Dom's intellectual property which is great for Dom

143
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,760
It's bad for me and my listeners because it means that pretty soon

144
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I'm gonna have to take all that content down off the audio to you dot com servers

145
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Which is fine? I understand that you know you had to go where there was money. That's fair enough

146
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,760
The three podcasts that he supplied me one of them was called bum notes and that was a weekly music news segment

147
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,760
And I'll be straight up front man. That was not pod safe. He would you know research all the things that happened in the world of music over the pre-seeding week

148
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,760
And you know there would be bits of songs from the artists that were mentioned

149
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,760
The next podcast that he had was called Stan and Deliver which was a series of weekly interviews with comedians

150
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,760
And the last one which is the one I want to discuss was called waxing lyrical and it was a series of interviews on a weekly basis again

151
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,760
with musicians and as you would expect

152
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Those interviews featured the music of the artist who was being promoted

153
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:35,760
So you know he had an interview with Bodiddly and that podcast featured Bodiddly music

154
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,760
So where exactly does that fall because you're promoting the artist

155
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,760
So you would think that it would be okay to use the music of the artist because you're promoting the artist

156
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,760
But the artist is licensed and therefore you know not pod safe as we would say

157
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,760
So just interested to know what what happens in an instance like that

158
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,760
You know the s-cap BMIs of the world gonna you know jump on podcasts is from a great height

159
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,760
For promoting a licensed act

160
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
That's just the biggest case of shooting yourself in the foot of ever heard

161
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Anyway, can you hear your thoughts?

162
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Can you hear more pod safe music because there's some absolutely fantastic stuff on the pod safe music network

163
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,760
The song you played in 275 right at the end Bob Gentry I think his name was was awesome

164
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Anyway, dude, that's it from me. Keep up the good work and we'll talk to you soon. See ya.

165
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Right now I'm buddy and Bob Gentry is gonna be up here by the way. We're gonna try and hook up

166
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,760
I had a little email back and forth with him and he said that you know, he's selling records

167
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Actually brother love said last night. He said dude first time I made rent money because of sales of my music

168
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,760
So let me sorry about the condition of background. Let me try and address this because there's so many questions about it

169
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,760
In essence the way the way the licensing works. I'll just try and run through it again really quickly

170
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,760
There are two pieces and the piece that that should be easily solvable is the broadcast performance part

171
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Which is what ask happened be am I take care of but using that alone won't allow you to actually play any any license music whatsoever

172
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:22,760
You still have to have the the rights from the owner of the master which typically is the the record company

173
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,760
So if you have those two pieces then yeah you can you can pretty much although the Harry Fox agency may jump in there

174
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:36,760
At some point and try and grab some money as well and there's C sack and other organizations which is why you know after I've really done the work on

175
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,760
On investigating what the possibilities are I've just I've given up on it. You know and I think that

176
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Although it really is a shame when I hear that you know it's like you know we legally can't do a profile on bow didly you know

177
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
Who of course is a legend

178
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,760
I think the only way to play this right now is to just ignore him just ignore all license music

179
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:05,760
And when we have the numbers and we can prove and substantiate the the kinds of numbers that the

180
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Music industry I think is looking for because I'm not thinking promotion. They're thinking only sales and theory

181
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,760
That's the only way they look at it. Yeah, yeah promotion is great, but we got radio stations. We don't need all that

182
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
But you know now you're kind of stealing this to put this on your show

183
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,760
That's all that they're concerned about and I'd really hope that through mashups and hit tests

184
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
We could actually create enough

185
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Momentum that

186
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Enough sales momentum because I was you know quite cognizant of what the record industry is really looking for

187
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,760
I hope that we would be able to convince in time by saying hey look you know

188
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,760
This is not stealing music. This is actually promoting music and look at resulting in sales

189
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,760
I have to say was not successful at achieving that that fell on pretty much deaf ears

190
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,760
I think we have to come back when we have you know when we're doing a million spins for pod safe songs

191
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,760
You know and then maybe we can turn the tables and maybe we we ask for we ask for a couple more things

192
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
When they come back to us and say hey gee, you know you guys are really kicking ass there

193
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Okay, would you mind playing some of our tunes and that's where I think the tables are turned and where we get to say no

194
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,760
I don't think so because your licensing is all out of whack and maybe you should get that straight home in a second

195
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
This is the

196
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
The pod pimp Aaron or so

197
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Let me just see what's going on

198
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
Hey Aaron

199
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Hello

200
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Did that work?

201
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Oh, okay

202
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Missed the call

203
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Yeah, that's typical

204
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Lots of stuff going on. I guess the

205
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,760
The expo the first keynote starts in about 25 minutes

206
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
I don't think I'm going to make the first one

207
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
And one of the things being streamed live at all

208
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,760
That's what I enjoy so much about nom decks and blogger con and pop tech and stuff like that

209
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,760
I don't know if this conference has a life streaming feed or not

210
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Because you know that way you can kind of do you can multitask you know you can begin your room getting ready for something

211
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,760
And you can still listen to some of the conference some of the the keynotes that are going on

212
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,760
So I hope that well, I'm sure this is going to be one of the most podcast events in history

213
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,760
So I'm sure I'll be able to get everything I'm looking for after the fact

214
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
So

215
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Yeah, so it's I must say the the feedback that I've been getting about about going 100% pod safe

216
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Proud to be pod safe has been just phenomenal and I've been getting more

217
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Yeah, I got you Aaron, I see you boys milk

218
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
I've been getting

219
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,760
More offers of pod safe music than ever before the signups at the pod safe music network

220
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,760
And oh by the way, there's just to be very clear it's that's not the only place you can get music that could be Dean pod safe

221
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,760
You can get it from places like Garage Band and Megatoon

222
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:53,760
But what is taking care of at the pod safe music network is the basically the license that if you sign up as a podcaster

223
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Anything you see on the pod safe music network you can use without having to pay for a license

224
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,760
And the artist has a similar set of rights where they can also if they want to take their

225
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,760
So on right off the pod safe music network no longer have that license in effect

226
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Go ahead, the license is over there and they're there for the reading

227
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,760
And if you have any comments we'd love to hear about them we've changed them in the past

228
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
If the community felt that they should be adjusted a little bit

229
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,760
But I think that we're so far we're doing pretty good on

230
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:30,760
On all that although there is one lingering question which I think is solved, but we're going to get a legal opinion on it

231
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,760
If someone has a song that is registered with AskCapper BMI for the performance rights

232
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,760
And they still put it on the pod safe music network

233
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,760
The opinion I guess is that for that's a separate agreement

234
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,760
It's a separate licensing arrangement the artist at all times is in charge

235
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,760
It's not like BMI and AskCapper all of a sudden are in charge of their work

236
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,760
They're a collection agency so if it's on the pod safe music network then you have a license to play

237
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
That without having to play a performance royalty

238
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,760
That's pretty much the answer to that question

239
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Let's see, I think there was a couple more about pod set music

240
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Let's see what we have here

241
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
What's up man, I'm Mrs. J Mag from hoodide.com again

242
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
I had a quick quick, well actually let me first apologize at the sound quality

243
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:23,760
This is the guy from hoodide.com which is a rap hip hop R&D podcast of pod safe music

244
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Which is kind of hard to find and this feedback will explain a little bit why I think

245
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Hopefully you can make it through this without getting totally irritated with my voice and the quality of this through the phone

246
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
My microphone a home sproke

247
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Anyway, what I'm trying to do is get more artists off of this

248
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
You know from the street and onto the internet

249
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,760
The problem is a lot of people don't deal with computers are kind of scared of the internet

250
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,760
So I had an idea was to you know the service taxi if you're not already familiar with it

251
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,760
It's just an ANR service. All they do is they're a conduit between record labels and artists

252
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,760
The record label puts up a class of five listed being the artists and it's their music to taxi taxi

253
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
The taxi's ANRs take a look at the music

254
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,760
If it's worthy to be submitted to the label then they turn around and submit it to label otherwise

255
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,760
They send it back to the artists to let them know you know what could be changed or whatever

256
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Anyway, having said that taxi probably has a massive database of unsigned artists

257
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Which these are paying members. They pay like $300 a year to be a part of the service

258
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,760
So my idea is this try to form a relationship with taxi to the point where when they're

259
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Members and on and for their existing members to offer them a membership into the pot safe music network

260
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Now this would allow artists to put in whatever songs into the pot safe music database under that license

261
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,760
So that's the thing that I'm getting at is I'm wondering if we have a way that we can we can tap into that

262
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,760
And I contacted a guy named Chris over at the taxi yesterday

263
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,760
And he said that they only deal with really huge record labels and really big film production companies

264
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Which kind of it was a downer for me, but you know we're talking

265
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,760
I mean if we can go at them with your numbers with your pot, you know for your daily source code and for the

266
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Pot safe music network and say look this is something small this is something that's eventually taking over radio

267
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:30,760
If we can show them that maybe it will be a valuable asset for them to offer to their to their artists

268
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,760
The thing is they it needs to be something of value because these people are paying paying good money to be a member of the service

269
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,760
So having said that I would really like to hear your feedback on that. I would also like to hear back feedback from any other podcast

270
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Or so if you can email me my email addresses JT Mac JT MCK at Gmail.com

271
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Or you can actually call me and I don't mind if you play it on the air my my cell phone numbers 810 599 0202

272
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I would love to hear what you have to say and I'd really like to see if you have any other resources as far as getting people from

273
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,760
You know from the streets on to into the pot safe music network and ultimately you know into my

274
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Five cast as well as other people

275
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,760
And also I forgot to mention the beauty of this thing was it is it is a service that's online

276
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,760
It's through the internet, but it originated through you know they have catalogs and the people mail their stuff in

277
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,760
So that's the big thing is you know that's that's getting people who aren't necessarily on the internet

278
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,760
So that's a huge thing anyway. Good back with me. Thank you so much Adam have a great day. I love the show.

279
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
See yeah right on buddy

280
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Well here's what we've done

281
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,760
We have hired Michael Butler who of course already was a member of the pod squad

282
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Doing the rock and roll geek show and he's also managing the music block on the serious on the on the serious 103

283
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Which airs I think between 9 and 10 and 930 and 10

284
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Oh, before I forget Monday starting Monday on serious 103 right after the daily source code Pacific Coast Hellway

285
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Our new pod squad member to join

286
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,760
If you're listening to serious and even if you're not you know if you're if you can't wait for Howard Stern to show up

287
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Give Pacific Coast Hellway a shot

288
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I think you'll like it

289
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,760
So we've got Michael Butler in and Michael what he's been doing he's been doing this proactive work

290
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,760
So if if you if you if you're confused if you don't have a computer

291
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Or if it's a little bit too daunting give them a call at at pod show

292
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I think

293
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
What is the what's our phone number?

294
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Hold on a second. It's like 27704. Oh, oh, I think on let me see

295
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,760
27704 oh, oh, yeah, I think that's it in a 415 area code

296
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Just give Michael Butler call and and he'll definitely help you out and hook you up because that's where all about

297
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Did you hear the the beginning of the show?

298
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Now you know you really made it

299
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,760
When you become a question on jeopardy. Let's see if I can play this thing again

300
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Hot cast for a thousand no joke. This satellite radio company signed former MTV VJ Adam Curry as it's exclusive PJ PJ Amanda

301
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,760
What a serious. Yes, I'll take what's I'm a PJ everybody

302
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,760
I tell you my family got a kick out of that my aunt emailed me that. She's like, oh my god. You were questioning on jeopardy

303
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Oh my goodness. Okay, we got lots more feedback for some reason on today's show not a lot of promo is but a lot of feedback

304
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,760
I think I hope I didn't play this one by my mark. So I've kind of been shuffling stuff around and I don't of course

305
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,760
I've forgot you know half of the stuff I was supposed to be with my really want to whoops get this out

306
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Because again, it's just bugging me. I heard your podcast Monday regarding what the the record companies are doing again

307
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:17,760
And I'm not in the recording business, but I really am getting frustrated by everything sounding the same looking the same and here it is, you know

308
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:26,760
There is this great tool we have it's podcasting. I'm one of a hundred million people ready to embrace something different

309
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:34,760
I mean if an artist can understand that this is a great on ramp to get noticed. I mean I am ready to give you money

310
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,760
I promise I will and there's people out there all they want to they're tired of the radio

311
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,760
They're tired. They want they're looking for juice. They're looking for something that that's exciting

312
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:54,760
That's real and you can tell the fake stuff from the good stuff and please all I'm saying to anybody out there with talent let it out there

313
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:02,760
I mean if I had some talent, I don't care about the money so much right now as it is to let your your gift out there for the masses to know what it is

314
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:09,760
And that's what we've got to stay together on this because podcasts are right on this

315
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:17,760
This is a correct way of going and this is what's going to make us win in the long end long run. It is because it's right and it's about time

316
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,760
We all stand up to all the BS out there and we say no. This is how it's going to happen because we need it

317
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,760
This is a change that is going on now and if you don't do it this way guess what we get the same old crap day in and day out

318
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,760
I'm tired of it. No way the door has been open just a little bit and that's enough for me

319
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,760
And I hope it's enough for millions of other people out there. Thanks. Alright Mark. I think I did actually play that

320
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
But guys so enthusiastic

322
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,760
They're getting their heart out there and we're having a shitload of fun doing

323
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,760
From the podcast we've got to where now. We've got brain bucket let the book be loose on your daily source code

649
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Now don't worry

650
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Slowly be 10 Korean

651
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Until the music industry comes calling

652
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,760
About once you need to give the products and promotions to drink

653
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,760
In the meantime I get you a nice little quick situ

654
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
You're a plant on your show

655
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,760
All you have to do is guest the everyday household

656
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,760
and from the noises that they made.

657
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Okay.

658
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Firstly, I don't think it's very fair of jump, flat, to ask you to name the famous songs.

659
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Especially considering your whole career was based on talking over the beginning of them.

660
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Anyway, it's the first sound just getting to help.

661
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I'll give you a clue, Dan. I think it's a bit tricky.

662
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,760
There's a pair of them and you can use them to cut things.

663
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Is this a second one?

664
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
Okay, scissors.

665
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Then to these rules, things that you find lying around the living room.

666
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
There we go.

667
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,760
That's the thing you have to pay back in that ear and you will just listen to that.

668
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Okay.

669
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Right, here's the last one.

670
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
That would be a drill, I guess.

671
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Like this.

672
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
A lighter?

673
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Okay, so that's all three noises.

674
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
There's this one, there's this one.

675
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,760
And the other one as well, which I won't like,

676
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
just take too long.

677
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Okay, give you a minute just to think about the answer.

678
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
I'm just a new one.

679
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,760
This is Roger Smalls who is kind of a stalker.

680
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,760
He's written some stuff on my weblog in the past that I found very disturbing.

681
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,760
And I appreciate the effort there, Roger.

682
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,760
We'll check back in with Roger a little bit lately.

683
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm Suzanne.

684
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm Robin.

685
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
We are in siteworks.com.

686
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,760
That's INSYTWORKS.com.

687
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Where we believe in site and really works inside into ourselves.

688
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
And into others.

689
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
We look at everyday events.

690
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
And not so everyday events.

691
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Under the lens of depth psychology.

692
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Some of our past podcasts have included forgiveness, fear, decision making.

693
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,760
A really popular one that we did was body weight issues.

694
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,760
We've talked a lot about grief and some discouraging responses in grief.

695
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Yeah, we've also talked about emotional parasites.

696
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
Are you a parasite?

697
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Do you know a parasite or do you host them?

698
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
And those are all in the past.

699
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Let's talk about the future.

700
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Some future shows we expect to do are displaced anger.

701
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Expectations in relationship.

702
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,760
And we also are going to feature about dreams.

703
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Perfectionism.

704
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
And money, honey.

705
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,760
And somewhere along the way we will do a podcast about the theories of CGO and depth psychology.

706
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,760
The hot one is going to be when we talk about deviant sexual behavior.

707
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
How do you define it?

708
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
What is it?

709
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
And do you do it?

710
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,760
We will also start a series on self-injurious behavior.

711
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Also known as cuttings.

712
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Suzanne is doing her thesis on cutting.

713
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,760
If you're ready to get real and you're ready to get relevant, you are ready to get with us.

714
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Robin and Suzanne at insightworks.com.

715
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
So check us out and we'll talk to you soon.

716
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Bye for now.

717
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Thanks for sharing the journey.

718
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Deviant sexual behavior, huh?

719
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
All right.

720
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm subscribed.

721
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Here's a song that definitely characterizes what is going on here in Ontario with the portable

722
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Media Expo.

723
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,760
Monk, who I'm hoping to hook up with, talks about it.

724
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
The pod people.

725
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Yeah.

726
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Yeah.

727
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Yeah.

728
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Yeah.

729
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Yeah.

730
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
You seem lovely.

731
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Be in the right to me.

732
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Everything I need.

733
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Better than the old dead frequency.

734
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
From underground.

735
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
Hold down the sound.

736
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
Come set the fire.

737
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
Burn the old dial.

738
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
The China's now.

739
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
You are never alone.

740
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
All I know is a ground.

741
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Can't stand the title of all this.

742
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
And then you are wasted.

743
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,760
You've been brought to the bomb.

744
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Say, we'll call you and you'll be the same.

745
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,760
You say, we're wasted.

746
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,760
If I need one, take it over.

747
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,760
I need one, take it over.

748
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,760
In visions coming closer.

749
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,760
I need one, take it over.

750
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
We're in control.

751
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
Everywhere you go.

752
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
Once we start the blow.

753
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
You're in the know.

754
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
Like the BCHL.

755
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Can't stop the bleeding.

756
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Suck away the green.

757
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
Break down the beach.

758
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
Liberate for free.

759
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
Kill the radial crew.

760
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,760
You are never alone.

761
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,760
All I know is a ground.

762
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Can't stand the title of all this.

763
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,760
And then you are wasted.

764
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
You've been brought to the bomb.

765
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Say, we'll call you and you'll be the same.

766
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
You've been brought to the bomb.

767
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Say, we're wasted.

768
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,760
If I need one, take it over.

769
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
I need one, take it over.

770
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,760
In visions coming closer.

771
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
If I need one, take it over.

772
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,760
If I need one, take it over.

773
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,320
I can ride the holding glasses

774
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,360
and you can do that

775
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,000
And in nature the chemicals are

776
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But dear, this is paperwork

777
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:25,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

778
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:55,760
oh

779
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:20,560
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I can't understand the old let's play

780
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:27,600
Give yourself some extra boost, nice remote control, and then there's the Bluetooth headphones,

781
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,040
which also work with your iPod.

782
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,400
So check them out at Logitech.

783
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,560
I guess Logitech.com.

784
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,920
If you go to, if you go to daily source code to the show notes, there's probably a link

785
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,040
there, also a podshow.com.

786
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,320
There's websites really coming along.

787
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,440
I'm liking what I'm seeing here.

788
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,200
In fact, we also have a, let me go to it here.

789
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,440
We have a, let me say, hold on.

790
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,640
Podshow.

791
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,760
We have a rundown of what we're doing here at the expo.

792
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
Let's see.

793
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,800
So we have the Podset Music concert that was last night.

794
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,280
Then tonight at six o'clock at the Marriott, the Don and Drew Appreciation Party.

795
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,880
We have the Podshow podcast lounge.

796
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,280
Look for Aaron Bursell.

797
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,120
He's a big guy, you can't miss him.

798
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,360
He's a big guy looking like a big podpimp.

799
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,400
Find him if you want to come hang out at the lounge.

800
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,920
He Michael Butler is going to be around.

801
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,120
Actually saw him last night as well.

802
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,320
The Firf, Chris McIntyre is hanging around from the Podcast.

803
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,320
Ali, Steve Gilmore, was he going to be here?

804
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,440
I won't, yes, Gilmore is going to be here, I think.

805
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,840
I think we're doing the Gilmore gang, could do something this morning.

806
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,440
The mommy casters here with their daddies and magic courses running around doing all kinds

807
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,760
of wacky stuff, we're doing video reports.

808
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,360
So if you want to see those go to podshow.com, you can sign up and you'll get the URL for

809
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,800
the feed to subscribe.

810
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,960
Just one more thing I want to mention, slow is still working with Ronald and CC on the

811
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,120
if every day we're Christmas, we're trying to put together, actually, I think now that

812
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:07,000
what they're going to do is they're going to tag this song as owned by UNICEF with

813
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
ASCAP BMI.

814
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,280
So if it does get played outside the Podcast arena, then any money derived from that will

815
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,280
go to UNICEF.

816
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,680
So that's very cool.

817
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,400
They're looking for more soloists to sing along and they're looking for lots of people

818
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,440
to be in the chorus, so I want you to give CC Chapman, drop them a line, drop an email.

819
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,040
And hopefully, by Monday, slow says you might have something for me to listen to, so we

820
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,920
can start kind of previewing the work as it goes along, which I think is very, very cool.

821
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,360
Yeah, I'm a speedy love with Love House radio.

822
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,040
Wanted to tell you something that you're probably already aware of.

823
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
And that is that you're a very lucky man.

824
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,040
Yeah.

825
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,360
I'm not talking about your lovely wife or your wonderful family, I'm not talking

826
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:53,200
about your jet set life going to and from the UK to San Francisco or Pod Show or your

827
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,320
airplane or what are you talking about?

828
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,320
What I'm talking about is PWFN.

829
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
PWFN.

830
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
He does.

831
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
He does.

832
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
He does.

833
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
He does.

834
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
He does.

835
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
He does.

836
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
He does.

837
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
He does.

838
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
He does.

839
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
He does.

840
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,600
Rob at Pod cast four one one.

841
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,040
You everyone has been just truly helpful.

842
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,160
Um, so my show has kind of evolved into playing a lot of jazz and blues on Friday.

843
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,240
Uh, starting picking up the tunes off the Pod Safe Music Network and some of them were

844
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,880
PWFN in the second ward.

845
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,200
Uh, they just seemed to fit the mood for a Friday afternoon kind of easing to the weekend.

846
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,600
And so I figured, you know, what the heck?

847
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,560
I'll shoot PWMO.

848
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,340
See if you wouldn't mind throwing together a little intro for the Jazzy Friday show.

849
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:42,340
and a swear five hours later in my mailbox, I had this.

850
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,580
Hi, this is PW Fenton.

851
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:54,060
Man, Friday is such a great day.

852
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,300
In some ways, it's better than the weekend

853
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,180
because it's the beginning of the weekend.

854
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,700
And whenever I wanna begin my weekend

855
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,020
in a kind of jazzy, bluesy kind of vibe,

856
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,100
I listen to Love House Radio

857
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,580
because, well, that's where the love is.

858
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,660
So now I have to change everything

859
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,820
all of my slogans to read where that's where the love is.

860
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,740
I mean, PW has set the tone now.

861
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,100
But I just thought that was amazing.

862
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,300
Just wanted to share that with you.

863
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,540
You already know what you've got,

864
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,500
but I just wanted to prove to you that, yes.

865
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,220
PW is the man.

866
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,180
And next time you have a spat with him,

867
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,780
I'm gonna have to go on his side.

868
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,060
So anyway, take it easy, keep it real.

869
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,900
Thanks a lot, Adam.

870
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,220
Okay, so I'll probably be doing a show

871
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,620
over the weekend Saturday.

872
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,580
Maybe even Sunday since there's so much going on here.

873
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,660
Stay tuned to the podcast from around the globe

874
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,780
coming to you from Ontario, California.

875
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,620
And we'll meet each other if not Monday.

876
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,460
Maybe over the weekend.

877
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,620
Take care, everybody.

878
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,100
Bye bye now.

879
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,740
Another podcast, stick it in your ear.
