1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, in the next generation radio content in my ears.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Space trucks keep falling on my head.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Strange weather ahead.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Ice shells are lending behind.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Feel right, coming out the caps.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And trails filling out the caps.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Anywhere that the sun shines for you.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
As the chain flowing through our veins,

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
cell phones flying up rings, false cornflakes in the aurle.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A song that is living in the shed,

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but he's changed his name to friend.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, at least that's what he said.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No one ever, I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Space trucks keep falling on my head.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Strange weather ahead.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Strange weather ahead.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No one ever, I don't want ever.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Space trucks keep falling on my head.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If they keep falling on my head.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Strange weather ahead.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I need to make sure all spring skies are lending shorts.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Cause try to find certain light.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No, only for weapons or any kill.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's really time to take the pain.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You really have that way.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No one ever, I don't want ever.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Space trucks keep falling on my head.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Strange weather ahead.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Strange weather ahead.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Strange weather ahead.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Strange weather ahead.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't want ever, let go.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't want ever.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ê±¸.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't want ever, I don't want ever, I don't want ever.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm not.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't want ever.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,960
I'm not.

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm not.

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:39,400
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Like this, how do we go, like this

62
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
I wanna wake up

63
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,400
I'll ready to go, like this

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I really don't like this

65
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I got to wake up

66
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I really don't like this

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I really don't like this

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I wanna wake up

69
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,400
I really don't like this

70
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,400
I really don't like this

71
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I got to wake up

72
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I really don't like this

73
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I really don't like this

74
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I keep falling on my head

75
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Space rocks

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Keep falling on our heads

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
It's a way with the fairies

78
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
You know where I found that one

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
The podcast music network

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Everybody thank God

81
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Oh shit, I forgot my Friday

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Hey, thank God, it's Friday

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
It's a shitty Friday

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Horrible horrible weather

85
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
I had a whole flight plan

86
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,400
For a two-day trip of flight training

87
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
And hookin' up with some friends

88
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Actually, hookin' up with one of my lawyers

89
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Who helped me get some stuff

90
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Oh, hold on

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
That's not right

92
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
There we go, that's much better

93
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm gonna have some drinks with him

94
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
In Amsterdam tomorrow

95
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Afternoon

96
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
But shit, it's not gonna happen now

97
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Because we have over 20 knots crosswind

98
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Here at the local airfield

99
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,400
At Faroaks, Echo Golf, Tango, Fox Trot

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
And they expected to go up to 30 knots today

101
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
If you know, if you're pilot

102
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Then you know that doing that in a SESNO 182

103
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Even the RG version is just dangerous

104
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
It's too much wind

105
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
And they're expecting even worse for tomorrow

106
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
So it looks like flying will be delayed

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Until after the weekend

108
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Hey, guess what everybody?

109
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I am the Kate Winslet of Wikipedia

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh, man

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Talk about space rocks

112
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I came home last night

113
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
And like a huge fucking space rock

114
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Hit me right in the head

115
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
And I'm like, whoa, what's goin' on?

116
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Oh, my goodness

117
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Well, I appreciate everyone tuning in today

118
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
To hear what I have to say about this

119
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Well, I got a lot to say about it

120
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
First of all, yesterday

121
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I had a gnarly day trying to get into London

122
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I was visiting Tom Buyers

123
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Who was doing a guest

124
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Stint at the University College London

125
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Which is affiliated with Stanford

126
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
And it was two hours to get there

127
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I made the mistake of taking a car service

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Instead of the train

129
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Which I should have done

130
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Because once we're in London, man

131
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,400
It was pretty good to look at all the Christmas decorations

132
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
But it was gnarly

133
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
So I'd love to talk about that

134
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
But first, we've got to talk about this

135
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Wikipedia controversy

136
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
If you don't know what I'm talking about

137
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Then on curry.com

138
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
You can see a piece that I wrote about

139
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
At point to some of the original articles

140
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
That started this off

141
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
But wow, this thing is on fire

142
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
It's unbelievable

143
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Here's what went down two days ago

144
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I noticed in

145
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I used a Google reader

146
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
And I like it because it's almost like a river of news

147
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
The Dave Preaches

148
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
What I'm totally hooked on

149
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
But not quite

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
But it works well enough

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
And it's pretty ubiquitous

152
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
And so I've been using that

153
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
And I saw a reference to

154
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Maybe it was techno-radi

155
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
I can remember one of the other

156
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I saw a reference to

157
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
But because of course you know

158
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Every single day I get up

159
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
And I go to techno-radi

160
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
And search for myself

161
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
See if there's any articles about me

162
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
And I saw something about the history

163
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Of podcasting

164
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,400
And I hadn't looked at the Wikipedia entry for a long time

165
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
And I went over that

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I was astounded

167
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
But there were names in there

168
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Who I've never heard of

169
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I was like

170
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Wow

171
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Maybe brilliant minds

172
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
All do think like at the same time

173
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
And I made mention of that

174
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
In the source code

175
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Which was at Wednesdays

176
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
I think at Wednesdays show

177
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
That you know

178
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Neither my nor Dave Wine

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
There's contributions to podcasting

180
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
We're fairly represented anymore

181
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
And there were just a lot of

182
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Sexual errors in there

183
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
That I know to be

184
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Factually incorrect

185
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
And I don't know if Dave heard that show

186
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Or maybe

187
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
For somehow he also noticed that

188
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
The Wikipedia entries were incorrect

189
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
And

190
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
So I said, you know

191
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Shit man

192
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
And I have edited in this before

193
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
In the Wikipedia

194
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
And let me just point out

195
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Wikipedia editing is not trivial

196
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Now people think I'm full of shit

197
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Or at least that's what they're writing

198
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
But I haven't even figured out how to do my own

199
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Show notes properly

200
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Which is why I'm so happy with show notes

201
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Michael once in a while

202
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm able to you know

203
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I can certainly add a line

204
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
But when all those brackets and shit

205
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I just have no patience to understand

206
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Why can't it just be like HTML

207
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Is what I'm thinking

208
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
But anyway

209
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
That's beside the point

210
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Here's what I wanted to change

211
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
And I really did start to do this

212
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
And I started to write some stuff

213
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Kevin Marx

214
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
I actually

215
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
And it's kind of weird

216
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Because

217
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
I wanted to write the full story

218
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
I remember it

219
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Kevin Marx

220
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Well let me start with another piece that I took out

221
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Which is infinitely incorrect

222
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Trade secrets

223
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Was not the first podcast

224
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Okay

225
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Dave and I did try

226
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Trade secrets

227
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Way after he was podcasting

228
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
After I was podcasting

229
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
After Doug K was podcasting

230
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
So and that's something that keeps showing up

231
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Over and over again

232
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
And it's just it's not true

233
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
It was certainly

234
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Defining moment for both of us

235
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
And maybe it was the first

236
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Do-O podcast

237
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
When the word finally existed

238
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
But it's irrelevant

239
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
It was not the first podcast

240
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
You know what?

241
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Maybe I should

242
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Why don't I just

243
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I'll tell you what

244
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I'll recount the history

245
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
As I recall it

246
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
And then we'll get to the Kevin Marx piece

247
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Which is very important

248
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Because Kevin certainly does not get

249
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
The credit he is due

250
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Because he was a complete inspiration to me

251
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
And that's what I wanted to

252
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Defix actually

253
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
So

254
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
In 2000

255
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
It was

256
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Yeah it was pre

257
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
It was either

258
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
2000

259
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
2001

260
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
It was pre-911

261
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I met Dave Weiner in New York

262
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
And that by the way is for me

263
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Where the entire

264
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Concept of shipping large media files

265
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Through RSS

266
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Was conceived

267
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Dave had already done all of his work on RSS

268
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
And this is pre RSS 2.0

269
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
We met in New York

270
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
And I was talking about

271
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
The concept of delayed

272
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Basically time-shifting

273
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Content downloads

274
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
In order to give the user a great experience

275
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
By dripping the content

276
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Into their computer

277
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
And then only telling them that it was there

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Once it was there

279
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
So you could have a 100-meg file

280
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Downloading to your hard drive

281
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
And

282
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
And not even know about it

283
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
But then you'd get a message

284
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Somehow that would say

285
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Hey you've got mail

286
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Or you've got

287
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
You've got content

288
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
And then you'd click on a file

289
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Or however you open it up

290
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
And it would already be there

291
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
On your hard drive

292
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
So the experience would be fantastic

293
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
This was at a time when streaming

294
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Everyone was doing streaming

295
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
And the quality was just not

296
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Not really valuable

297
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Or didn't deliver on the experience

298
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Like put it that way

299
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,400
And I showed Dave some software

300
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
That I'd built in frontier at the time

301
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I think was frontier

302
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
I don't know

303
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Five, six

304
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Maybe it was radio

305
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
That's possible

306
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I don't remember

307
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
And from that meeting

308
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Dave created the enclosure element

309
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,400
And then of course subsequently RSS 2.0

310
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
And for four years

311
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
We would be evangelizing this stuff

312
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Attaching movie trailers

313
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Big clips

314
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Blogging about it

315
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
But I have to say

316
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
I was really thinking video at the time

317
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
And not thinking audio at all

318
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
So that was

319
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
So essentially podcasting exist

320
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
That ever since

321
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Radio user land

322
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
I think was the first aggregator

323
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
That did downloads of enclosures

324
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
So it was already there

325
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
It's just we hadn't quite

326
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Well the iPod wasn't there

327
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
That's what was missing

328
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
I think the real was there

329
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
But that connection really hadn't been made

330
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Let me see

331
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
What is the other

332
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
And I'm just going to go through my contributions to podcast

333
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
This is so ridiculous

334
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
We're doing this

335
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Okay, fast forward

336
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
To

337
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Just before blogger the very first blogger

338
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Con

339
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
And Dave was posting interviews

340
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
That Christopher Lydon was doing

341
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
On to an RSS feed

342
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
A separate RSS feed within closures

343
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
At the time I was doing

344
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I was winding down a stint

345
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
As I was doing a morning radio show

346
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
In the Netherlands

347
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
And I was really enjoying

348
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
These interviews that Christopher Lydon was doing

349
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
They were just

350
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
It sounded crappy

351
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
It was fucked up

352
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,400
It was just it was not like regular radio

353
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Yet the content was so compelling

354
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Was different lengths

355
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,400
And I was totally blown away by it

356
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
And I wanted more

357
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
The needle was in

358
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
And I was just waiting for this stuff

359
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
To refresh

360
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
And so it would download to my hard drive

361
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
And I would then basically

362
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Drag it over

363
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Oh that's oh by then I had gotten an iPod

364
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
And I didn't

365
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
I was not that interested in music

366
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
But I was heavy into audio books

367
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
I did a lot of audio books stuff

368
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
On the daily source code in the very beginning

369
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Because I really like audio books

370
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,400
And I was also dragging these

371
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
MP3 files into iTunes

372
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
So I could sync up with my iPod

373
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
And I think somewhere around

374
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Into you number four or five

375
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
I thought to myself

376
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
My goodness

377
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Wouldn't it be nice if it could go

378
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
On to my iPod automatically

379
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
And

380
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Marcus Moller

381
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Another person who is not mentioned in the

382
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Wikipedia

383
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Who was worked with me for

384
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
For years on schoolblocks.com

385
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,400
He actually created

386
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
I think it was a frontier script

387
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
I think it was an apple script

388
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
He created a little apple script

389
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
That would pull the directory

390
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
The download directory for radio

391
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
And if something new showed up

392
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
It would then pop it onto my iPod

393
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
So I actually Marcus

394
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Deserves some major props there

395
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Which he's never received

396
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
And certainly has an asked for

397
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
And he's not on the Wikipedia

398
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
So oh my god

399
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
What's wrong with the history here

400
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Then we had blogger con

401
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
And a blogger con

402
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I met

403
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Oh no shit

404
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Oh man there's so much more

405
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Christ

406
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I don't even remember the chronology now

407
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
After

408
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Lidens interviews

409
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I don't know if it was Doug Kay

410
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
That I started listening to

411
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Based upon Dave's recommendation

412
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
But

413
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
At blogger con

414
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
I met Kevin Marx

415
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
And Kevin Marx had created

416
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
An apple script

417
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
That would download in closures

418
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Now I don't think

419
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
It transferred everything straight over to the iPod

420
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
But we certainly discussed it

421
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
And I remember asking him

422
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
You know I do

423
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
We've got to do something with this

424
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
This is cool

425
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I'd love that script

426
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I don't think

427
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
We had a couple follow on emails after that

428
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
But he really completely inspired me

429
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
To get into apple script

430
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
And I'm like wow

431
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Maybe I can make this whole

432
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Front to Back thing

433
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Because although I like radio

434
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
User land

435
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
It used up so many resources

436
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
That if I wanted to have the whole

437
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Experience of stuff being sucked in

438
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Automatically

439
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
If I wanted to have that

440
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Running continuously

441
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
It really couldn't be radio

442
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
User land

443
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Because it really

444
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Used up way too many resources

445
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
On the computer

446
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
So I wanted a simpler solution

447
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Something would just go out

448
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
And check for the file once in a while

449
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Now I think that's somewhere

450
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Between there

451
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I also experimented with

452
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Some Python code

453
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Either Python or Pearl code

454
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Which I believe

455
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,400
I can't remember who did that original code

456
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
If I could have been slusher

457
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Man I don't even remember

458
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Maybe it was Ray or August

459
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I potter X who had done that

460
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
I can't recall

461
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
But for all intents and purposes

462
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
I set out on my own

463
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
After BloggerCon

464
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
While Dave was doing the democratic

465
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
National Convention

466
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
And by the way

467
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Those were in my mind

468
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
After Christopher Lyd

469
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
And definitely the first podcast that I listened to

470
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
And they were great

471
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
And we talk about it all the time

472
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
We talk about

473
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
About the microphone

474
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
About Mike technique

475
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
And Dave would do all kinds of wacky shit

476
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Like leave it running in his bag

477
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Without him knowing it

478
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
And he'd post all these files

479
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
And I even said to him

480
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
I said dude

481
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
If you were working on the radio

482
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
You'd be so fucking fired

483
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Don't stop

484
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
This is amazing

485
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
This is great shit

486
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
So

487
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Then I

488
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I'm not sure

489
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
I guess I didn't get any connection

490
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
With Kevin Marx

491
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Which is exactly what I wanted to say

492
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Because if he had had

493
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
This script working

494
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
All the way through to the iPod

495
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Which I don't recall it that way

496
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
In

497
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
At BloggerCon

498
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Then I'm not sure

499
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
If he had demonstrated that

500
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
How come

501
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
You know I didn't use that

502
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Because what I wound up doing

503
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Is searching all over the web

504
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,400
For XML parsers

505
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
There really wasn't an RSS parser

506
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Perse

507
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
For Apple script

508
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
I think there was some kind of OSX

509
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
AOSX thing that you had to include

510
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Or whatever

511
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Some

512
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
There was definitely some other code

513
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Which was all credited and commented

514
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
In the original iPod or Apple script

515
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
And it's like I'm fucking month

516
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Learn how to do this shit

517
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
And I created it

518
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
It worked

519
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
And then I put it out on iPod.org

520
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
And that's when

521
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
A whole bunch of developers jumped on board

522
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,400
This was extremely cool

523
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Because I was able to participate

524
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
In a software development process

525
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
As a user

526
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
This is the whole

527
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Users and developers

528
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Partying together thing

529
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Which probably lasted for another month

530
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
By itself

531
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Which

532
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
And I was very happy

533
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Dave purposely stayed out of that

534
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Conversation

535
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Even told me he did it purposely

536
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Because he said there was something

537
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Beautiful going on there

538
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
And it was because

539
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
The daily source code

540
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
For those of you who are wondering about the history

541
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,400
And the history behind the name of the daily source code

542
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Was really only created

543
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I knew that making an aggregator

544
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,400
That is downloading MP3 files

545
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Is

546
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
A lot of thought goes into it

547
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
And if you don't have something

548
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
If you don't have a feed to test it against

549
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Then it's a bummer

550
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
You have to keep creating feeds

551
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Or deleting content and going through it again

552
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,400
And so my commitment to the process at the time

553
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
And this is the iPod or iPod or X guys

554
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
iPod or lemon

555
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Nimmig

556
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm going to forget all of these different names

557
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
I can't remember all of them

558
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
A lot of Dutch developers

559
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Frankly

560
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
So I would do the show

561
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Which I called the source code

562
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Thinking source code would appeal to developers

563
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
And I did it

564
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Actually it started off seven days a week

565
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
So we called the daily source code

566
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
And I'd talk about my experiences

567
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Using their software

568
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
And that would be kind of the feedback loop

569
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
And it was fantastic

570
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Because they would

571
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
They're aggregators

572
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
And their iPoders would get my show

573
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
They'd listen to it

574
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
They'd be feedback there

575
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
And it just kind of grew from there

576
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Now early on we had this whole

577
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Who invented podcasting thing

578
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
And by the way

579
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Even the name is heavily disputed

580
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
The first I heard of it was when Dave Slusher

581
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Saw this podcasting.net

582
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Ork.com

583
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Show up in his referral logs

584
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
And that had been registered by Danny Grigwar

585
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
And that's to me how the name podcasting was born

586
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
But then hammerously of the guardian always claims

587
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
That he invented the name

588
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
In fact he did publish the name

589
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
A year before

590
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Danny Grigwar

591
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
But

592
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
You know it's like

593
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Okay

594
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
So it doesn't really matter

595
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,400
So that's essentially the story of podcasting

596
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
As I recall it

597
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
And following upon

598
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,400
The conversation we had on the last daily source code

599
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
That's my reality

600
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
That's the way I remember it

601
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I may be completely wrong

602
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Based upon Kevin Marx's reality

603
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Based upon Dave Wine's reality

604
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
You know

605
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
I don't know

606
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
But when I go into Wikipedia

607
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
To go change that stuff

608
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
You know

609
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Then for someone to say

610
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Which by the way

611
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
I didn't say Adam Curry did all this

612
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Adam Curry this or that

613
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
I haven't added any entries about myself

614
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Into Wikipedia.org

615
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,400
To say that I'm trying to grab more credit

616
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Or change history

617
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Isn't the Wikipedia all about changing history?

618
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
And quite honestly

619
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
This thing doesn't work

620
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
This Wikipedia shit is broken

621
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I mean now

622
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm even seeing people

623
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Say oh yeah

624
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
He was the first domain name

625
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Squatter with MTV dot com

626
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Well you know

627
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
That's not the the history of it

628
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
You know the history of MTV dot com

629
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Is that MTV allowed me to use it

630
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,400
You know I registered it before there was even a worldwide web

631
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
But you know so now that's how history

632
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Will be written forever

633
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm the Kate Winslet of the Wikipedia

634
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
And I am

635
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
The first domain name squatter

636
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Well so be it

637
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
I can't help

638
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
What you think

639
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Now I do think what we'll be fun to do

640
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Since Wikipedia the whole idea of

641
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Making something editable

642
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
And text it's just too easy

643
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
As you can tell

644
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Here's the prime example

645
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
And now by the way

646
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
If you read the comments

647
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Everybody hates me

648
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
I'm busted

649
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
I don't know what I'm busted for

650
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
For using the fucking Wikipedia

651
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
And trying to figure out a wiki

652
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Well I was writing this as I said

653
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I got fucking

654
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Exasperated with the whole

655
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Process of writing in a wiki

656
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
And the two pieces that I wanted to change

657
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Did wind up getting edited out

658
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
But nothing was added in

659
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
And that's the piece that is unfortunate

660
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,400
So now you've heard what I wanted to put in

661
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Now you've heard my

662
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Perception of how podcasting started

663
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
And you know

664
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Just like in the universe

665
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Just like with let's take a car for example

666
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
You can't

667
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
What's more important?

668
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
The engine or the steering wheel

669
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Now you may say steering wheel

670
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
You may say engine

671
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
But of course

672
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Every single piece of the car is important

673
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
You can't drive without the steering wheel

674
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
You can't drive without the engine

675
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
You can't drive without

676
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
The tire valve

677
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Being in place

678
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
You then you'd have

679
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
One flat tire

680
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
So all of these pieces in the universe

681
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Had to come together

682
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
And I'm sure that these people

683
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Who's names I don't even recognize

684
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
In wiki pedia

685
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Entry for podcasting

686
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm sure they were they contributed as well

687
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
At the end of the day

688
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I personally

689
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Really don't care

690
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
I mean I've been having too much fun

691
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Working with

692
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Hundreds

693
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,400
If not thousands of creative talented people

694
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
You know

695
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Changing

696
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Radio broadcasting

697
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Changing

698
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
The music business

699
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Yeah

700
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
And I can't do this by myself

701
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Yeah, I'm not the one that's responsible

702
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm not

703
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm certainly not

704
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Ever tried to take full credit

705
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
I've given

706
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I've given plenty of credit

707
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Where credit is due

708
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
So anyway

709
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
And nothing I say here will make any difference

710
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
But at least I wanted to have it on record

711
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
So the thing that I thought would be interesting

712
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Is to create a podcast of the definitive history of

713
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Wait a minute

714
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
The definitive history of podcasting

715
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,400
And I know who should do it by the way

716
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,400
And I think I know how we should do it

717
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Doug Kay has to do this

718
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Doug Kay is the perfect candidate

719
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Everyone loves Doug

720
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
And Doug has a heart of gold

721
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,400
And as far as I know Doug he's extremely honest

722
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
And a damn good pilot

723
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
And what if he were to

724
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Set up a project

725
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
And you know I'd gladly help

726
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Or contribute to the funding of this

727
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
To the podcast academy

728
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Or IT conversations

729
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Or whatever is necessary

730
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
To get this going

731
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
We should have him

732
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Interview

733
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
All the people who have been involved in podcasting

734
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Now that's a lot of interviews by the way

735
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
It's just look at all the Wikipedia entries

736
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Or maybe we go to Wikipedia and look at all the changes

737
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
And look up the IP addresses and see if we can trace everybody

738
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Thanks easy net by the way

739
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,400
For putting on the fucking personal information

740
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
In my in the right database

741
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
That really helps my god

742
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
You know I've often the phone has been ringing at night here

743
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
It's fucked up

744
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,400
So then you could have all these different versions

745
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,400
All side by side

746
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,400
And I think you'll find that the chronology gets messed up

747
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
I know for sure that I have my chronology messed up

748
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,400
You probably have to pull up

749
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
It's a big project

750
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
But it would be very interesting

751
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
If we could create that as a historical document

752
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
So that we'd have it

753
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
And it would be non-changeable

754
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Because that's the downside to the Wikipedia

755
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
And you know it's like

756
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,400
When you've been interviewed in a newspaper

757
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Or for a magazine or for some website

758
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
It never comes back the way you told it

759
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
It never comes back the even the way

760
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Usually not the way you intended it to be

761
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
It's whatever the reporter was thinking

762
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Usually what they already had preconceived

763
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
You know and you can massage that kind of stuff

764
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
And you can you can work it

765
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
But you know so the same thing you know

766
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Then you kind of will distrust anything that's written ever again

767
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Because it's all written from someone else's reality

768
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
So that's my reality

769
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
I wasn't trying to do anything

770
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
I'm not saying I didn't try to edit

771
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Then I saying I didn't want to edit

772
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
I'm saying that I did get exasperated

773
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
With the Wiki and stopped editing

774
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
So

775
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Kate Winslett of the Wikipedia

776
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Anyway, I'm really happy I have all your attention today

777
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Because we have a fantastic project that I wanted to introduce to you

778
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
This is something that's been going on for a couple of weeks

779
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,400
We have the pod save for peace Christmas song

780
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Which is now complete

781
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,400
And I have the honor of premiering that right here

782
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
On the daily source code

783
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Quick history about this

784
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Slow a member or contributor to the Ponte music network

785
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Upload it a song called If Every Day We're Christmas

786
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,400
And on one of my usual morning scans a couple weeks ago

787
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
I heard the song I played it on the source code

788
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
And

789
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Hold on a second

790
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
That's the phone

791
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,400
I'll talk to you later

792
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Okay

793
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Wow, it's almost like an old fashioned source code

794
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Where was I?

795
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Okay, so I played this

796
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
After the song played on the source code

797
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Wow, man, that's almost kind of like a we are the world

798
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Or bandaid

799
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Do they know it's Christmas kind of kind of song?

800
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
I said wouldn't it be cool if we had a whole bunch of pod save music artists

801
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
All joined together

802
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,400
But not in a physical studio, physical location

803
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
But actually have them contribute tracks

804
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
To create a similar song

805
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
And then hopefully we could

806
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Maybe get to race a money for it

807
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
We could sell it somehow

808
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,400
And we could race a money for a worthy cause

809
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Well, this got picked up

810
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Slaw immediately jumped on it

811
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,400
And CC Chapman of course did a humongous job in getting everybody

812
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Or as many people as possible involved

813
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
So

814
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Since we don't have a wonderful video

815
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Which of course is something I didn't think about

816
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,400
As we should have had everyone sending a piece of video of them

817
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Recording their tracks at their home studio

818
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Because then we really would have had something cool

819
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
He's giving me the lineup

820
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
And I'll just go before I play the song

821
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
I'll go through everyone who's on it

822
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
In order of appearance

823
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
And then we'll play this wonderful piece of work

824
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Of which all proceeds if any

825
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
We'll go to unicef

826
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,400
So the pod save for peace lineup

827
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Here we go

828
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
It starts off with Slaw

829
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Slaw actually put in the

830
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Where these people are from

831
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
First one, Slaw New York

832
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Matthew Ebel after that from Nashville

833
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Then verse two, Holler from Miami

834
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
May of Oboil from Glasgow

835
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Chance from Los Angeles

836
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Then we get the first chorus

837
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Which is a chance and Slaw will start that off

838
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Then you have the whole chorus joining in

839
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I think this is like 96 tracks of chorus

840
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Verse three, brother love from New York

841
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Josh Cruz of cruise box

842
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
He's from Oklahoma City, Kevin Reeves from Nashville

843
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Then the chorus again

844
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Civilist Bitties do the bridge

845
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Then we go into chorus three

846
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Chance, Holler

847
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Oh, I actually has a chance as woo

848
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Holler does every day every day

849
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Brother love, we would never feel blue

850
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
All these little improvisation things

851
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Then Josh Cruz comes back and then Carmen Tyler from Texas

852
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Brother love and Josh Cruz again

853
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400

Lorina Mirei from Miami

857
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
My god, there's so many people on this

858
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Let me see if I've got all the names

859
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Okay, so then we have the break down

860
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,400
God, we're going to put all this in the show notes by the way

861
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,400

From this old town

899
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
A Christmas show

900
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,400
And the lighting of that famous Christmas tree

901
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,400
People are shopping for them loved ones

902
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,400
And making plans for a Christmas tree

903
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Christmas trees

904
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Running all goes by

905
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,400
And then we have to wait

906
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Another

907
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,400
What if everything

908
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Christmas

909
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,400
What a wonderful

910
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
This would be

911
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,400
You never feel blue

912
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,400
We make all our dreams come true

913
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
And Christmas

914
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
We're every day

915
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,400
It was time to bring out the good people

916
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I just look around now and you will see

917
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400

921
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,400
What if everything

922
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Christmas

923
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,400
What a wonderful world

924
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
This would be

925
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,400
You never feel blue

926
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,400
We make all our dreams come true

927
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
And Christmas

928
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,400

Until then

934
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
It's Christmas again

935
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,400
What if everything

936
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Christmas

937
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,400
What a wonderful world

938
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
This would be

939
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,400
You never feel blue

940
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,400
We make all our dreams come true

941
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
And Christmas

942
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Christmas again

943
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
What if everything

944
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Christmas

945
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,400
What a wonderful world

946
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
This would be

947
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
You never feel blue

948
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,400
We make all our dreams come true

949
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,400
And Christmas

950
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,400
We're every day

951
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,400
It's Christmas

952
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,400
What a wonderful world

953
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
This would be

954
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
You never feel blue

955
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,400
We make all our dreams come true

956
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
And Christmas

957
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
We make all our dreams come true

958
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,400
And Christmas

959
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,400
What a wonderful world

960
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,400
This would be

961
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
You never feel blue

962
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
We make all our dreams come true

963
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,400
And Christmas

964
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Christmas

965
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
What a wonderful world

966
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
This would be

967
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
You never feel blue

968
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
We make all our dreams come true

969
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
And Christmas

970
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
What a wonderful world

971
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
This would be

972
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
You never feel blue

973
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
We make all our dreams come true

974
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
What a wonderful world

975
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Christmas

976
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
What a fantastic song

977
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Oh man

978
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
That is just it's lovely

979
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
That's really really cool

980
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
And I personally want to thank everybody

981
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Who contributed

982
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
To that

983
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
And so the work is only begun now

984
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Now it's the podcast

985
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
First of all

986
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
If you work at a radio station

987
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
And somehow

988
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
And somehow

989
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Almost

990
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Unthinkable realm of possibility

991
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,400
You have the opportunity to play this song

992
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Please do

993
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Because all Ask Cat BMI

994
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
And it will be

995
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
If it's not already registered with Ask Cat BMI

996
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
It will be

997
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
All of those royalties

998
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
That come in from playing on the radio

999
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
We'll go to Unicef

1000
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,400
We're going to try and get this on iTunes

1001
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
So you can buy it there

1002
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
I had a thought of

1003
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Also seeing maybe we created CD

1004
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
And put it up at CD Baby

1005
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
So you can actually

1006
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Order a physical copy

1007
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
And then the proceeds from that

1008
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Of course we'll also go to Unicef

1009
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Slower's handling all this by the way

1010
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
And I have every

1011
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Every confidence that he's exactly how to

1012
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
How to put all this stuff together

1013
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
In fact here's something interesting

1014
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
He called over to the folks at Unicef

1015
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
And said, Hey, you know, we want to make sure

1016
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
This money comes to you and

1017
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Here's what we're doing

1018
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
And their response was

1019
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
And I was afraid this was going to happen

1020
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
The response was quite typical

1021
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Well, yeah, you know, but how much

1022
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
How much are you going to donate?

1023
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
We need to know the number up front

1024
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
8 million, 10 million

1025
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Slower's like

1026
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
I don't know, you know, maybe a couple hundred

1027
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
If we're lucky a couple thousand

1028
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
So

1029
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Unicef

1030
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
With any big nonprofit organization

1031
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
I think that their name is probably

1032
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
You so often in vain

1033
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
That they're very, very wary of who they

1034
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Want to team up with. So I don't think we're going to

1035
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Any direct help from them

1036
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
I

1037
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Truly styler

1038
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Does a lot for Unicef

1039
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
And I've met her once at a benefit

1040
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Interestingly enough, I want to see if

1041
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
I can get through to her

1042
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
The old back channels are a bit rusty

1043
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I'll see if I can get through to her

1044
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
And see if we can work something out

1045
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
With Unicef and otherwise, you know, there's no problem

1046
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
And donating the money to Unicef

1047
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
You could even do that right now

1048
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
You don't even have to do buy anything

1049
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Just go ahead and send them some money

1050
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
It's all done for love and for good cause

1051
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
And I think it's fantastic

1052
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
So podcasters, my call to you

1053
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Is to play the shit out of this song

1054
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Let's see if we can break it through

1055
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
To to mainstream radio

1056
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Wouldn't that be interesting

1057
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Instead of them getting

1058
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Getting play on podcasters

1059
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
It's the other way around

1060
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
And if not, it doesn't matter

1061
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
We are all entertaining ourselves

1062
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Daily source code, it is the Friday edition

1063
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Holy shit

1064
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Been at this for already 40 minutes

1065
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Michael Butler sent me an email

1066
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Yesterday that there's a

1067
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Brand new record company that is adding tracks

1068
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
The podsaid music network

1069
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Silk city records, welcome guys

1070
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Appreciate it about to eight tracks up on line now

1071
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
It's one of the really liked a lot

1072
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Robin Banks, someone to talk to

1073
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
When it's cold at night

1074
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,400
And you're all alone

1075
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,400
And you're warm up

1076
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
And you're warm up

1077
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
And you're warm up

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
And you're warm up

1079
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
And you're warm up

1080
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,400
And you're warm up

1081
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:47,400
And you're warm up

1082
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,400
And you're warm up

1083
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
And you're warm up

And you're warm up

And you're warm up

And you're warm up

1089
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Where you know, where I'll be

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Sometime baby, they have nothing but need

1091
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,400
I still wanna talk to you

1092
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:37,400
You come to my back door

1093
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Don't rain the bells

1094
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Just walk right on him

1095
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:58,400
Ain't nobody gonna tell me

1096
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,400
I'm gonna pick you up

1097
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Yeah, I'm gonna rub you down

1098
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,400
I'll be your fix at my mark

1099
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:24,400
On the edge of town

1100
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,400
There you know, you can count me

1101
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Yeah, just call me when you need

1102
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,400
It's someone to talk to

1103
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,400
It's someone to talk to baby

1104
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,400

I'll be your fix at my mark

When it's cold at night

1110
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Oh, in your bed

1111
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,400
And a million worries

1112
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Running through your head

1113
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,400
Where you got my number

1114
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:24,400
And you know your way

1115
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:31,400
And you got no reason

1116
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:38,400
To deny babies

1117
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Where you know

1118
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Where I'll be

1119
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,400

Yeah, just call me when you need

00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,400
I'll be your fix at my mark

1126
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,400
On the edge of town

1127
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,400
I'll be your fix at my mark

1128
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,400
On the edge of town

1129
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,400
I'll be your fix at my mark

1130
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,400
On the edge of town

1131
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,400
I'll be your fix at my mark

1132
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Robin Banks, someone to talk to

1133
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Soak city records

1134
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Welcome to the pod safe music network

1135
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
And that's about

1136
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,400
Excuse me about it for today's daily source code

1137
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,400
Those of you listening to serious stars

1138
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
You're probably saying what the hell is this show been about?

1139
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Well, welcome to the world of pod casting

1140
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
We're a routy bunch

1141
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
That's for sure

1142
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
And remember, if you're looking for the Kate Winsle of the Wikipedia

1143
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,400
You come to the right place

1144
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,400
Alright, so

1145
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
I guess I don't know

1146
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Now my whole day is reconfigured

1147
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,400
Since I was planning on flying

1148
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,400
I'm gonna see if I can figure something else out to do

1149
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
I think I probably have to go

1150
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,400
Do some more keyword searches on technology

1151
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
See what everyone's saying about me

1152
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,400
I will say

1153
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
In closing

1154
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
About all that

1155
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,400
This is exactly

1156
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Like the mainstream media world

1157
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
And quote celebrities

1158
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
What's happening

1159
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,400
It's amazing

1160
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
It's amazing the attacks that I'm seeing

1161
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,400
And by the way, people who hate me for my hair

1162
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,400
Don't hate me for my hair

1163
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,400
You know, I've noticed that most people who make jokes about my hair

1164
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,400
Don't have any hair

1165
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,400
Oh, what was me?

1166
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,400
What was me?

1167
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
I wanted to play one more song

1168
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
But I'm gonna cut it short for now

1169
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,400
I wanted to play Betty by the list of these bitties

1170
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Because they are without a doubt

1171
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,400
I think they have a break out to smash with this thing

1172
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
Everyone seems to be playing it

1173
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
And reporting back to the pod safe music network

1174
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
So I'll make sure

1175
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Maybe I'll do a show over the weekend depending on what's happening

1176
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,400
If not Monday, I'll be sure to play Betty for you

1177
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,400
If I haven't heard it, you can find it at
