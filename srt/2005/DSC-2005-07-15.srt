1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta CR Charlie 2.0 9.0

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello everybody.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The source code for July 15.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've been rebooted.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, it's what you get for not using the cast blaster.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's the daily source code.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Today we have the studio set up in super configuration mode

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
because we're going to have a guest on the show.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Joining me in about eight minutes or so will be CC Chapman from Boston.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I see she's got some exciting stuff to talk about,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
which I've been hinting at more or less for the past couple of weeks.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So we'll find out about the pot-safe music network on today's daily source code.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sorry about yesterday's a snap-hoo.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Many of you may have gotten the file or maybe had to download it manually.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I guess the short-term memory that goes first, what I had done

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
as I had done the show notes and published everything,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but forgot to upload the file to the servers.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Me and help one of my friends.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I suck.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It gets even worse than that.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Since we're using Akamai, what Akamai does, it goes in and says,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
okay, I've got to get this file,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
dsc-25-o7-14.mp3.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And it says, oh, it's not there.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Then it returns an error and then I start uploading,

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
then it starts giving the cash-basically pieces of the file.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I learned a lot about the content distributed distribution networks

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
last night's experience, so won't happen again.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Alright, let's kick the weekend off just right.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A dog from mashuptown.com sent me great one to kick off today's daily source code.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is something that we're kind of bringing the right mood for the weekend.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I got sex and drugs and rock and soul on your daily source code.

You know, it's going to be outlawed.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,640
man is going to come down on us. I wish that there was a way to actually, you know, really

143
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,880
do something with those mashouts, but it's, uh, it's become just impossible in the record

144
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,320
business to do this. You know, it would take months of clearances for every little sample

145
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,240
that's used. And, well, so let's just enjoy it as long as we can. What you hear in the

146
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,560
background, of course, is the lovely Converre. It's on, uh, on low today. Since, uh, we have

147
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,440
a nice, uh, son, but there's also about, uh, 10 knots of wind coming out of the west, which

148
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,640
is basically blowing, uh, some cool air in, so it's much, much nicer today. I'm so happy, uh,

149
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,120
just the past couple of days have been unbelievably hot here in, uh, in the cottage, uh,

150
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,640
which has been, I'm not, I'm not complaining, but, you know, it's like, and now you have to

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,760
record something, which means, you know, it's hard. It's hard to get motivated when it's really,

152
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,640
really hot. Video extreme is positively proud to produce and present Professor

Hi Adam, this is Father Oadric. I've launched a new podcast called The Secrets of Harry Potter.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,840
In this podcast, I'll answer all sorts of questions about the magical world created by JK Rowling.

160
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,080
Is Harry Potter good or evil? Why is there a unicorn in book one? Did the philosopher stone really

161
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,920
exist? Why is Harry's alcohol had weak? And did the Pope really condemn the Harry Potter books?

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,880
Will the role of evil lord Voldemort be played by Bill Gates in the upcoming movie?

163
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,240

164
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,440
Ah, the good father's at it again! First it was the Da Vinci code, and tonight at midnight in the UK,

165
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,520
the new Harry Potter book is being released. Kids are going to be lining up in

166
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,560
fun of bookstores in the middle of the night, and unbelievable, and they've had a lot of press

167
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,640
moving up towards this release. Particularly here in the UK, of course, because JK Rowling is from

168
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,960
the United Kingdom. I don't know if all the Harry Potter movies, I think certainly the first one,

169
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,080
she insisted that it was filmed on location and in the studios here in the UK. So she's pretty

170
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:48,440
much a hero over here. Estimated worth, I think, is 750 million pounds. Because I read the

171
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,000
financial times, the newspaper I'd like to read, and so they've always had the financial angle,

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,640
and about this Bloomsbury publishing company. It's really quite an interesting story. They've

173
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,600
really done something great, and I'm so happy because kids are reading. That's pretty damn

174
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,560
important. Who cares if it's Harry Potter? Now, of course, there's been this big controversy about

175
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:14,520
what the Pope supposedly said about Harry Potter, and if you go over to Catholicinsider.com,

176
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,880
Father Rodrigues, not only these two Harry Potter podcasts, and I don't know if there's going to be more

177
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,560
in the series, and he really should listen to him. They're really good, but he also has links to stories

178
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,920
about what the Pope really said, et cetera, and there's also, he was, he just sent me an email about

179
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,320
how podcasting has revitalized Vatican radio, and there's a lot of cool stuff that they're doing,

180
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,760
and they seem to be re-energized, and it's just nice to see that. He sent me a press release through

181
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,280
email, asked if he had an online source, that I could point to. So if it's there, I'll put it in the

182
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:57,000
show notes, obviously, for today. Okay, so let me position the mic a little bit here. I've set

183
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,640
up the studio so that we'll hopefully be able to get a good connection here on CC through Skype.

184
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:12,040
So let me just get him on the phone on the Skype's. Hey, CC, how you doing? Good man, what's up?

185
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:20,200
Hey, home fries, it's all good. It's all good. Today it certainly is. That is for damn sure.

186
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,280
So, where were you born, man? Where was I was born in New Hampshire? Really? Born in

187
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:33,480
born and bred raised up in a New England. Oh, man, was your family's rich? Yeah, not boy. No,

188
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,000
not definitely not a privilege of bringing in all of this. Okay, damn sure. All right. So, CC,

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,400
I've been talking about about, you know, this pod safe music network for for weeks, maybe months,

190
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:53,880
I guess. Yep. And, you know, today, I guess, is the day. Why don't you want you to tell me what's

191
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,600
happening? It's funny. I've been talking about it too. I was listening to an old interview. I did

192
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,960
two months ago that just barely got put up on a podcast the other day. We're at at no sack.com

193
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:11,480
with no stacks of dot com. Yeah, N.O. S. A. C. It's the one in Bergek show. Love it. And there's some

194
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,840
friends of mine. So I talked, you know, they're good buddies of mine, but I talked about this like two

195
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,840
months ago saying, yeah, this has got to go live soon, blah, blah, blah. And I listen to it this week.

196
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:25,480
And I'm like, yeah, it will be absolutely. So it's very cool. I mean, the pod safe music network.

197
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,400
I guess it's safe. Yeah, by the time this goes out, I mean, pod safe music network.com,

198
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,720
it's going to be the place to make it easier for podcasters to find pod safe music and for artists to

199
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,680
submit their music. And, you know, right now it's tough. I mean, you know, you've got these podcasters who

200
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,520
would love to play pod safe music if they can find it, but they got to take time to go to, you know,

201
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,560
great sites like garage band and my space stuff and go around. But it's tough. I mean, I've done it.

202
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,840
It's not easy. But not only do you have to search through stuff by downloading things or that

203
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,760
everyone has a different way of looking at it with real player or whatever, but you also have to

204
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,080
see if they give you permission to play it on your podcast, because officially you need permission.

205
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,400
I mean, it's not like every independent song out there. You can just grab and play on your podcast.

206
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,280
I mean, exactly. And you see it all the time, you know, people hear a song on one person's

207
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,840
podcast and assume that they can play it. And it's not the way it should be. And you do have to

208
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,880
get permission and it can take time and you're running around and we want to make it easier. And what's

209
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,840
great about this is so from our disposition, I mean, our just comes to this website and they say,

210
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,480
you know what, I want to share these two songs for want to share this whole. Right. Whatever they want.

211
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,840
Right. And they upload those songs and by uploading it, I mean, they're telling the world,

212
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,480
hey, if you're a podcaster and you want to register for this site, which is free for everybody,

213
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,040
you know, sign up, you know, I'm submitting these two songs in any podcast or who registers on this

214
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,120
site, can download it and play it, you know, as long as they, you know, play the usual rules, you know,

215
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,520
they link to the artist, they give, you know, the proper plug to the artist, so the artist gets to credit.

216
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,280
Right. And on the flip side, I mean, an artist, a podcaster comes in, they register and they get

217
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,520
access to all this music that's just sitting there that they don't have to ask permission for, because it's

218
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,760
already been granted. I've been, I've been working on, I've been working with the beta for the last

219
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,840
thing, two daily source codes. And I'm, I'm signed in as a podcast. I don't can actually sign in as a

220
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,920
listener as well as a podcast. Not yet. It's coming. Listeners, though. I mean, anybody who doesn't

221
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,000
register can come in right now in stream, it's funny. Oh, I've already got emails from the artist

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,760
asking about this. They can stream any of the songs. They can't download them, but they can listen to

223
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,640
every, every song you see hasn't really played a little flash play right next to it. Streams it right

224
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,240
down so you can listen to it. Listeners, we'll be able to register soon and be able to, you know,

225
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,560
sort of devote and plug their artists, you know, and show their love for it, but not yet.

226
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,480
So it was, it was really, what I liked about it, and this is the part that I provided my input on,

227
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,000
is so I go and I have my own little area in the PodSafe Music Network, which was also my show

228
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,760
information, which I just, I got highlighted on one of the refreshes that I did on the home page,

229
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:03,480
which was nice. And I can go into the library into the database, let's say I just call it a library,

230
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,360
and I can search for different types of genre of music, or if I'm looking for something specific,

231
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,080
or I can browse through it, and then I can listen to it sample it, you know, just by clicking on a

232
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,120
button on the page, and then I can add it to my playlist, and then I downloaded it for playing it

233
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,960
on my show, and then next time I go back, I just, you know, it's like a little bit of admin,

234
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,680
by saying, you know, register, what does it, what does it actually say? It says, uh, we can actually

235
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,480
say that I played this track, which is important. You don't have to do that part, and the other thing

236
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,000
too is you don't actually have to download the track, you can actually play it live right there,

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,720
if you're set up. Exactly. Exactly. But what's cool about coming back and saying, like, hey,

238
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,320
I just, you know, I just played slim on episode, you know, 40 of accident hash. And it's a form that

239
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,840
takes you through that, right? You don't have to fill out all this stuff yourself. All you do is you put

240
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,080
a name of it, name or number of an episode, it's just a text field that's up to you, and you say the

241
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,040
date, and what's cool, what's why that's cool is because then on the artist page, if I go to look

242
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,120
at slim or, you know, if it's a Van Gogh, you go to that page, it's going to show the last five

243
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,920
podcasts that played that song. And it's going to link over and likewise, if I go to, you know,

244
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,120
the daily source code profile, it's going to show the last five tracks that I played exactly. Right.

245
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,920
And the listener could just be an invention. And very soon, we're going to give the artist

246
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,880
the ability to actually, you know, go in through there, you know, login and see the actual dates

247
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,560
and link to the shows. So that way, they can, you know, because artists want that stuff. They want to

248
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,360
put in their press kits and send it out to people. And so we're trying to make it easy for everybody.

249
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,960
So, um, so that there's this data, obviously, that, um, that is, you know, being a mass that

250
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,320
can be used for some great statistics, which are right there on the site, such as what I have here

251
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:49,000
I had hold on a second. It was, uh, most listens, uh, top rated and most pod play. So I presume that

252
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,240
that's coming from people, uh, coming and checking out, listening, just by clicking on the play button.

253
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,560
The pod play one actually comes from the thing I was just talking about where the podcaster says,

254
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,120
I played this song. That's where most pod play comes from. Most listens is how many people actually

255
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,360
just clicked on that little streamer and listen to the, to track and top rated is we're going to have

256
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,320
the ability so that you can come in and give a one to five star rating on any, on any, on any track.

257
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,680
And then there's also the ability to click on, you know, show me top 10 artists and he'll show

258
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,160
those categories in one big, long list. So what I like about this pod play thing is, um, in the,

259
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,680
and I've talked about this many times, but I might as well do it in, uh, in the quote, real radio

260
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,720
business and which is completely, you know, they're, they're joined at the hip to the music business.

261
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,440
The way it works is, you know, a record comes out, but it's carefully scheduled with promotion,

262
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,480
predominantly radio promotion and the way it works is, and you know, it's not like everyone's all,

263
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,360
you know, in cohoots with each other, but the guy in New York who's making the music list for

264
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,560
the radio station there is definitely looking at what the guy in Los Angeles is adding to his playlist.

265
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,480
And they do that through a number of, of different ways, but the, the main, the main publication

266
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,520
for that is radio and records. And in fact, on the back page, and it shows you exactly what each

267
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,120
station is playing, what they've added, what they've dropped from their playlist. And then,

268
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,240
I guess, eventually we could go on to like charts, right? We could do, um, the data's going to be there.

269
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,840
Yeah, we could do lots of that. I love that. And one thing I want to stress because I know

270
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,240
there's been lots of talk about this in the podcasting world is when, when people see this, I know

271
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,600
the first thing they're going to see is around the front page or if you go to profile page of any of the

272
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,240
podcasters, you're going to see links like subscribe, Vx, and now you're going to see an iTunes link.

273
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,240
And I just want to stress to the podcasters that the podcasters are entering all that data.

274
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,840
So there's none of this locked in stuff that people have been worried about. I mean, in your profile,

275
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,280
you actually say, hey, I've got an iTunes link. Here's the one I want. Yeah, I've got updates,

276
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,440
which is crucial. Yeah, I did, too. But when iTunes went live, we had to add that iTunes excited.

277
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,520
It takes you right to the iTunes page of your website. If you're in there, hopefully,

278
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,720
hopefully Apple is getting everybody in there. Yeah, and we're talking to them. We're trying to,

279
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,840
we're trying to help them out and fix some stuff. Yeah, they need some help. So let me,

280
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,160
I'll tell you, I have lots more questions. Let me play podsaic music right now. This is,

281
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,680
actually, I went to the page today. You know, I got to put this stuff closer together.

282
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,400
I went to the my most pod play and let's see. I don't know how to pronounce it. We need a pronunciation guide,

283
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,480
phonetics next to it. To your, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm going to say it either. Yeah,

284
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,680
I'm not sure. Anyway, the most pod play on podsaic music network. I'm going to give that one a play.

285
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,320
This is a filled and we'll be right back and we'll talk some more. Okay, so you see. Cool. All right, stay with me.

286
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:45,560
We've all four is the same thing that has us yearning for heaven in our youth. I'm the same

287
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:52,920
pain that has elders wishing for more time to find the truth. Yeah, truth will never be found

288
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:02,040
pure in the mistomber life. Do this spirit is to live in liberty and be bound to earthy

289
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:11,480
treasures that cannot please and divine soul of man that learned to be free and constrain the

290
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:20,600
flesh and learn and can make a tendency. In a world filled with every pleasure that we can

291
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:29,240
continue. It's a replacing of arrangement that happiness we can achieve. What is it with trying

292
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:36,040
to where what is the pain we try to appease? Where's the source of this unknown inch that has

293
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,560
us bent on self-destroying? You don't have this spirit. It's to live in liberty and be bound

294
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:53,000
not to earthy treasures that cannot please and divine soul of man that learned to be free

295
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,760
from constrain the flesh and learn and can make a lot of tendencies. Yeah, there's a good time

296
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,600
and maybe it can't just let's true six, two, two, right, and let's donate and take it

297
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:14,120
hot so high you're now going to do a cry. Oh, there's no holy thumb up, do some respect for most

298
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,920
do the plummet, the key to bear life down in the promise to comfort that God said.

299
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:49,320
Will we know physical satisfaction will never feel a spiritual void? Much like a square peg while

300
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,400
it make other will never feel around how much like speculation will never

301
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:02,600
concretely answer the question post just like you'll never know who you are without seeking

302
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:12,200
the source of this spirit is to live in liberty and be bound not to earthy treasures that cannot

303
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:20,760
please but divine soul of man that yet to be free from constrain the flesh and learn

304
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:28,920
can make a lot of tendencies to be filled with his spirit is to live in liberty

305
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:39,400
and be bound not to earthy treasures that cannot please but divine soul of man that yet to be free

306
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:47,800
from constrain the flesh and learn can make a lot of tendencies to be filled with his spirit

307
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:57,480
is to live in liberty and be bound not to earthy treasures that cannot please the divine soul of

308
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:06,120
man that yet to be free from constrain the flesh and learn can make a lot of tendencies

309
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,840

through Skype and we're playing music the people have made maybe with garage band i was just like whoa you know

319
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,680
this is this is something big happening here yeah it's it's so it's so damn cool i mean it's funny

320
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,760
not to keep plugging bands but that's what we're about um as reading this article the other

322
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,240
on my podcast heard the show and checked him out and saw that he had a gig and they actually

323
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,320
extended their vacation a day and hung over in Maine so they could check out the band live because

324
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,880
we were on a podcast and i'm like that's the story people need to hear i mean that's that's

325
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,800
what it's all about i mean that's why i'm doing this it's all good it's all

326
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,800
all right one thing yeah i think i don't want to forget about the site i i just want to i'm

327
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,200
totally gonna abuse the power i've got at the moment i want to thank Chris Rockwell from the daily

328
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,640
download it's two nine thousand from extra super action show right around the Chris did all the

329
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,160
PHP program and ensued it all the design work and these guys worked their asses off and i want

330
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,000
to personally thank them for all the hard work and the headaches they went through to get this up because

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,920
it could have been half as good without both of them yeah big boys big big big boy mega boy yeah

332
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,400
i know that and and it's unbelievable and how this has been going on for how long will be as

333
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,640
everyone been working on this two three months maybe at least two three months has been a lot i mean i

334
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,120
know this is the fourth complete different looking feel of it so it's it's been going through lots of

335
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,120
revs and there's a lot more coming and we've got a shopping list of enhancements that are still

336
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,040
to come so okay and and and and if you have feedback there's a contact i've already over the past

337
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,320
couple nights got feedback from artists who have found it and put in their music and ad

338
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,320
hey can you have this genre or you know it would be nice if we could act you know whatever it is

339
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,760
i was also thinking what i almost missed there is i can i can feel the community but there's no

340
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,880
place to leave a comment that that's actually it was funny we've had two artists actually say hey

341
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,800
you know why don't you have a forum in here so you know we can all network together and meet each other

342
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,440
exactly i think so yeah i think it's all done yeah like on the artist page so people can

343
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,280
can just provide feedback just doing you know like a maybe just a comment thread right there

344
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,520
right on just a single simple thread i don't know if you have to go into a big forum and all but uh

345
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,200
yeah and we want to give we want to give artists a bunch more you know access you know plug their

346
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,320
shows you know the calendars and blogs and all that jazz so it's it's much more to people can say

347
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,920
hey i love you know chance or i love you know whoever who's the else is on here i'm looking

348
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,680
and let's create bless on you know who that is but people can say hey i love these guys and get

349
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,560
updates from them and everything so yeah so i can totally uh here's someone out there going oh

350
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:44,760
but wait a minute the evil pod show was behind all this of course so i'll wait a minute this is uh are

351
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:53,400
we paying you CC not yet how are we gonna make money with this that's a good question

352
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:00,600
do we have any sponsors coming uh yeah and and there would they be anybody what why would

353
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,880
someone want to sponsor something like this would anybody have heard of these sponsors?

354
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,520
well uh if you go to pod safe music network.com you can see already that we have the sponsor

355
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,120
absolute is uh is really underwriting uh the launch of this project and that's mainly because

356
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,400
you know first of all it it really fits with uh with their brand and with their product

357
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,920
but also you know it's the summer it we've got the they want to be involved with a lot of music

358
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,200
it's uh you know it's just it really it was a good fit for their strategy and what i thought

359
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,480
go ahead what i thought was cool about them was you know they said hey we don't want to be labeled as

360
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,040
a sponsor you know because we're we're supporting you guys we think it's a cool thing and you know

361
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,680
i mean they you know call it say that you know pod safe music network is flavored by absolute i'm like

362
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,080
yeah yeah that's great and good i like that too and now they got peach vodka which i'm excited about

363
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,840
i don't i'm not a big vodka fan but peach vodka's gonna go really good on my iced tea for when i record

364
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,280
that stuff is actually pre mixed it's it's absolutely it's called absolute a peach it's

365
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:07,240
your latest flavor uh it's peach vodka so sounds pretty good in me uh and now i believe and although

366
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:15,800
i don't know if it's working yet but um so the concept is um if you play a song uh uh the you've

367
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:21,320
downloaded from the pod safe music network compalking is a podcaster now um then do i i have

368
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,960
believe i get like a referral code and i can put that into my show notes and then if you click on

369
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,040
that it'll take you into the artist's page is that how it works it's coming that that's one of

370
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,800
those states that's why we're in beta right um yeah we're gonna have the ability so that you know

371
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,160
if the podcaster plays a song but one of the artists in the network um they can actually put

372
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,120
in an affiliate code and link to the artist and link out to uh you know place to buy the CD or buy

373
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:52,920
the digital download and get a commission for that link right okay so you'll be able to buy the

374
00:28:52,920 --> 00:29:00,200
music yes you will oh that's really make money okay it's coming and um and that's but but one

375
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,200
thing to stress is that's completely optional because some artists you know don't have a CD they've

376
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,840
got one track or they don't want to sell it on this network and that's cool they can still be

377
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,680
put their stuff in here they don't have to sell it there doesn't have to be any money change in hands

378
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:19,160
right um this is cool dude I really like this this I'm I'm excited yeah in many ways for me this

379
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,720

00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,400
I love it, God damn it.

439
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
I hate that shit.

440
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,440
No, I can't know, no, no, no, I actually, I think it's good, let's say.

441
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
It's all station.

442
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
It's awesome.

443
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,720
At least, you know what you're getting then, you know, you're going to get what I think is

444
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
the good stuff.

445
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Right.

446
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
So I'm going to get the good stuff.

447
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,400
You're not going to get morning show banter for me, do you hate indie music?

448
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Obviously not.

449
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,240
So yeah, if there's indie, I wouldn't mind being the indie of anything, you know, shit.

450
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Hold on, CC.

451
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
You're still.

452
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
You're home.

453
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
You're home with me, man.

454
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Very a humor.

455
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Yeah.

456
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Thank you.

457
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
That was very good.

458
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Featured artists on the Podsake Music Network.

459
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,560
I see there are also shows that are featured, including this one.

460
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,160
I know because I put myself in, who's on there?

461
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,880
How do you get on?

462
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
What's the deal?

463
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,000
Well, there's two parts.

464
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,240
I mean, one, any podcaster out there, anybody, even if they're not, if they're going

465
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,000
to play music, if any sort can sign up and be on this site and get music, there's, you

466
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,760
don't have to be a music, I mean, we've already, I saw, I don't know how we found

467
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
now.

468
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,200
I saw Senator Edwards podcast is on here already.

469
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Really?

470
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Yeah.

471
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,440
I know he's going to, because I actually got an email from the producer a couple

472
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,880
weeks ago saying, hey, you know, can you, they're playing like a song at the end now?

473
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,320
He's like, can you give me some music that would be appropriate?

474
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,880
Which I think is, I was psyched on a very cool, yeah, I'm that, very cool.

475
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,640
So anybody can sign up, but then on top of that, what was cool is, you know, Podshoe

476
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,320
wanted to sign some more, uh, ban, uh, more music producers to Podshoe.

477
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,960
And I, I had the, the happy, happy pleasure of helping find them, and I just wanted

478
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,160
to take a second to plug them all and, and let the world, you know, do one of these

479
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
damn announcements and let everybody know who's on board.

480
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Yeah, go for it.

481
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
All right.

482
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,680
So, um, first up, everybody sort of Michael Butler, uh, he, uh, I'm sure people don't

483
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,680
know, wait a minute.

484
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,040
He doesn't always play Pods, you know, traditional Podshoe music, but he started another

485
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,160
podcast called the Rock and Roll indie cast, and he's playing nothing but Podshoe

486
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
music.

487
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,120
It's great stuff, um, Michael's great.

488
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,520
So he's on board, uh, Mark from the Tart and Pod cast, the single, the best music

489
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
podcaster in Scotland.

490
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,400
I don't know if there's others, but he's the best in Scotland.

491
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Mark's a great guy.

492
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
So that's it.

493
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
The Tart and Pod cast.

494
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,640
We've got Canis Lupus and Renum Reef from ban tracks, yeah, ban tracks out in, uh, Boise

495
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,560
Idaho playing cool mix in music, uh, Julian Smith from in over your head radio, uh, he's

496
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
up in Montreal.

497
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,920
He plays a lot of cool laid back hip hop, emo, and Julian has just got a killer look

498
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
out looking on life.

499
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,720
I love the guy.

500
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,360
Mark is couch with the scenes scene out of Chicago or that one shot, really cool guy.

501
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,480
And I left him to the last because this guy, this guy is a personal personal friend of mine

502
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,200
who we've been through shit together that no one could ever stand big mic with the

503
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,880
extra super action show, um, playing the best hardcore and punk coming out of San Francisco

504
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
and beyond.

505
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,680
Um, so those guys altogether make it up this little music and for Pod show that's

506
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,720
going to, you know, really push and make, you know, make a lot of noise when music out

507
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
there.

508
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,040
And, of course, also accident.

509
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh, oh, yeah, I'm part of that.

510
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah.

511
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah.

512
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,200
Oh, the other plug everybody else didn't, you know, yeah, no.

513
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,080
And what was, and it's funny because I know people are going to go, well, why these

514
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,440
guys and blah, blah, blah.

515
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,320
And, you know, we, we went out, look, I mean, I know you said you know, go, go find some

516
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,840
people C C and it was, you know,

517
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,000
find, not just great podcasts, but also, you know, cool people who are looking, you know,

518
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,640
who are embracing podcasts when you want to see your community. That's exactly what you do, of course.

519
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,200
Yeah, I mean, that's what it's about. This is about building community all around and, you know,

520
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,760
anybody who thinks otherwise is just on crack because that's why I'm in this, I'm sorry.

521
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,120
I mean, I haven't gotten too much shit, but I know I'm going to get some, and it's just,

522
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,800
you know, I want to get the music out there here and get these emails from people ever since

523
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,000
iTunes which live saying, oh my god, I had no idea there was all this music out there

524
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,240
I've been sick of radio for years. I'm like, that's the person why I'm doing this because they get,

525
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,000
they get the listen to, you know, brother love or Mike Chappellier, they get the listen to these guys
