00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta Shara Charly 2-3-3

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yo DJ, are you the next player?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I just think it's a battle curry.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Bunny Bunny, it is the first of September 2005 at your source code.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wow, those of you who have been listening to the source code for a while will know that at the beginning of each month you're supposed to say

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Bunny Bunny or Rabbit Rabbit or something like that, and good fortune will come to you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's exactly what my fortune could be said the other day.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It is Thursday.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is September 1st.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Your deadly source code from Curry Cottage in Gilford.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Time now is sort of 7 minutes before 2.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It is much smaller today.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yesterday was a mega scorcher.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
31 degrees centigrade in the shadow.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Dude, it was very hot here in the studio complex.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was all psyched up today because I got some exciting news to talk about.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
All right, it's supposed to news.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, it's news.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's something that we've changed.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I think it would be interesting.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And my bar stool was supposed to be coming today.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That will happen tomorrow, but I've got one coming to complete the podcast complex.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That of course, the pod save music ready to roll for you.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's morning.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Again, I got a really late start.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
First of all, Patricia had a major coughing attack around 6 a.m.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Of course, I woke up.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My brain starts to spin.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Curry.com is down.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Any podder.org is down.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'd take Patricia to the hospital.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Not for the coughing.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She got kind of sailing for that yesterday.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But to have an x-ray taken over neck, which is bothering.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've been bothering her for the past couple weeks.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Everything's okay, though.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We're rolling now.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And curry.com is back up.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And indie pod.org will be back up very shortly.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So I'll tell you what the genesis is of all of that.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And some important news about the pod safe music network.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All of that today on Thursday's edition of the Daily Source Code.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
To kick it off, though, we've got an awesome mashup.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The dog smells like roses.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
99X served up to you by mashuptown.com.

51

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, I smell smoke, he smells like a dog, the old junkie, to the ROS ESC team.

189
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,200
The dog smells like roses, 99X mashed it up for you here on the daily source code.

190
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
What ever happened to apps, Axel Rose?

191
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I know he was back doing some stuff, but man, those days of guns and roses, they

192
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
will never return.

193
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm afraid.

194
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
But where were they superstars at the time?

195
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Man, that was good times.

196
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,300
So we have established now that the daily source code, when playing, and not just the source

197
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,700
code, but mashups and other features such as the hit test and the backtracks podcast.

198
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
They sell tracks on Apple's iTunes.

199
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
It's a proven.

200
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:57,180
We have a good sample of people who have spent anywhere from a couple bucks to over $3,000

201
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,000
Canadian, just a purchase, music that they've heard, all from the back catalog, wouldn't

202
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,400
be surprised if someone ran off and purchased a couple of guns and roses tunes today

203
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
after hearing that mashup.

204
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,360
So I've been experimenting, put a couple of Amazon links into the full outline of the show

205
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,720
notes, which you can find now at www.curry.com, back up online, and daily source code.com.

206
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,360
So I'd also applied for an iTunes affiliate status.

207
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
And I received an email this morning.

208
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,480
Dear Adam Curry, we regret to inform you that iTunes has chosen not to accept your application

209
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,520
for the iTunes affiliate program at this time.

210
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,200
This may be because the content is unrelated to iTunes, doesn't sound right?

211
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,320
Your site is temporarily down or under construction, well, that of course could have happened

212
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,360
yesterday, but this application went in much, much earlier than that.

213
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,400
Please make sure to apply again after two weeks.

214
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,880
So I got to wait two weeks, at least for that.

215
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,560
The wrong or mispelled URL, no, I did that, did the right one.

216
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Your site is aesthetically unpleasing.

217
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,800
Yeah, it could be that.

218
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Your site promotes tobacco alcoholic beverages or excessive drinking or drug use.

219
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,600
My site doesn't.

220
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,960
Your site contains extreme religious content.

221
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,080
Your site is international.

222
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,360
With a majority of visitors based outside the US or written in a foreign language, it is based

223
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,120
outside the US, but the majority of visitors, I think, are US.

224
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,800
So if any of the above problem on a criteria can be resolved, we look forward to your

225
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
re-application.

226
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,880
Okay, I'll do it after two weeks.

227
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,960
Or of course, if anyone in Apple's listening, you could just kind of shuttle me through

228
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
when make it happen.

229
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,960
You can prove more points and make more money and sell more iPods, but that would be just

230
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
up to you guys, not up to me.

231
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Okay, what should we talk about first?

232
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,640
I think curry.com is a good one because it was down for cash.

233
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,880
Must have been down for about 14 hours, as well as indiepotter.org, formerly known as iPotter.org.

234
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Problem.

235
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
He's going to love this.

236
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,280
Now, we're in the process of migrating this stuff over to a much stronger server.

237
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,640
You know, this is a server, I'll actually a couple of servers that I've had for a long

238
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
time.

239
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm, you know, in in server years, like three years is a really long time.

240
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,240
And I built up a whole infrastructure at an ISP, actually, a co-location facility in

241
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,520
the Netherlands, who I work with for a long time, and they've always done great justice

242
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
by me.

243
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,520
So I've been up quite in infrastructure, you know, servers talk to each other and handing

244
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,960
data off from one to the other and load balancing.

245
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,880
And, you know, the typical stuff you get set up over the years without doing a formal architecture,

246
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,520
you know, kind of just doing it.

247
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,880
And so, you know, there's all kinds of strings and wire and a gaffer tape, but it all works

248
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
kind of.

249
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
And we've been doing a lot better.

250
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,680
And now that we've, you know, reduced the traffic, which was really killing the server

251
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
of comments spam.

252
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm talking like one a second, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom, just sending comments spam

253
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,720
and comments, of course, you take up server resources, because there's a post involved

254
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
in a database access.

255
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,520
So we've been resolving that mark as we've been doing a great job.

256
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,760
And, but still, the application that's running does fail once in a while.

257
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,200
And, and sometimes, you know, also just for this whole move, we've got to be in the box.

258
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,560
And the hosting facility that I've been working with, apparently, the beginning of this

259
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,560
week went into chapter 11, which means that now the cash flow positive, it's one of their

260
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,680
debtors has debtors, creditors, I'm sorry, has put them into the Dutch equivalent

261
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
of chapter 11.

262
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,880
So they still continue to operate because they are cash flow positive.

263
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:41,400
But there's a court-appointed entity called the curator, which is just another lawyer,

264
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:50,600
who came up with the luminous idea to block port 22, which is the SSH port, as you know.

265
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,920
So that no one could change anything from the outside.

266
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,560
Well, of course, there are customers there.

267
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,480
I believe even you too, as a customer, I'm not sure.

268
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,520
I think some of their multimedia stuff is at the same hosting collocation.

269
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,080
So you can't change anything, or you can't log into your box via SSH, which is the only

270
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,520
way to get in, really, on a secured box.

271
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,840
And so, you know, we couldn't get a work around.

272
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,720
We basically had to wait for a court order to gain access from dedicated IPs.

273
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,720
And what we basically, we finally figured out the guys and gals over there worked very

274
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,240
hard to help us out.

275
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,560
And so that's back up and rolling.

276
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,200
And in the meantime, we done some DNS tricks to at least resolve something.

277
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
So we could give you a message about what's going on.

278
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,040
That's why IndiePotter.org probably, by the time you hear this, it may start resolving

279
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:45,120
back to the normal server, but that can take up to 24 hours, even longer than that.

280
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,960
So a little glitch in the system.

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,160
Sock to just a bit, but there you go.

282
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
We're back.

283
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,520
That really sucks, though.

284
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,680
It's a freaking horrible.

285
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,040
When your server is down, you can't do anything other than literally jump on an airplane

286
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,080
and fly over and go sit in front of the console yourself, which was not really an option

287
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,320
at this point.

288
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,960
So I said that my bar stool was going to come today.

289
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,160
Tom Hickey emailed me a while ago and he says, look, I've got a bar stool store online.

290
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
It'd be happy to sponsor the Daily Source Code with one.

291
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,760
He didn't even want anything in return.

292
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,840
He said, this is actually just for all the fun shows you've given me, which is great.

293
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,880
But of course, I'll plug this shit out of him.

294
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,200
He was going to show up today.

295
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
That's actually why I kind of planned the source code to be around this time.

296
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,760
But I guess he's going to show up tomorrow.

297
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,960
So I'll try and coordinate the show when he actually comes in.

298
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,160
So we can test it live on the air.

299
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,800
So to speak.

300
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:49,120
One quick little email here, this is a fun for an experiment, something we can do.

301
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,960
Well, I'm moving around my stuff here.

302
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,920
I want to talk about the Podsate music network in a couple minutes.

303
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,120
Email from DGA Stapons.

304
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,400
He's from Belgium from Bossles.

305
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,280
He says, this is really interesting.

306
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,000
And I like what he said here.

307
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,640
I listen a lot to podcasts when I walk to the office and when I work out, running, writing

308
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,040
my mountain bike, race bike, bouldering, whenever he's bouldering.

309
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,280
I've noticed that locations can trigger my memory about a particular podcast.

310
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,640
It happened again today.

311
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,400
I rode my mountain bike along a route I take frequently, west of Brussels.

312
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,360
And in a certain road crossing, I remember a discussion about a new tablet PC on the tablet

313
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,560
PC show.

314
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
I'd listen to it in the previous time.

315
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I rode past that location.

316
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,080
Kind of a reverse sound seeing.

317
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,720
Things I see trigger sounds I hear.

318
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,520
Have you experienced this or have people mentioned this to you?

319
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,800
OK.

320
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,320
Now, this is very interesting.

321
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,480
Because what I want to do in experiment with you right now, you listening to this show.

322
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,680
Look up, look at your environment, look at a road sign, or something by the road.

323
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,480
Just something that the first thing you see, the first thing that comes to mind.

324
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,040
And now, remember, senseo.

325
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,400
So the next time you drive by, see if the senseo, this is a great advertising trick.

326
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,120
See if senseo pops into your head.

327
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,320
If it does, then we'll have learned something very critical to podcasting,

328
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,120
and the way they're consumed, and open up a whole new avenue for advertising.

329
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,080
So whatever that road sign was or that house, or some stationary object that you saw whenever

330
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,600
you see that next time, you're not going to be able to help yourself, but think senseo.

331
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,280
I was not paid by senseo for this experiment, but I'm happy to do so.

332
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,200
Hello, it's me, which you taught, Rutherford.

333
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,160
Hey, you know what? Nothing's funny today.

334
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
That's close to that hurricane that head down there.

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
Oh, he is bad, and I know you're saying it on the news and stuff.

336
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
And there's a bunch of people down there that lies this Torah.

337
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,520
Thank God, now I have to live in, nothing to eat, nothing to drink,

338
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,760
hang out, no, nothing, no clothes, they don't need some help.

339
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,200
They really are now.

340
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,760
If you be so kind, it's a go-like to the salvation army and give some clothes,

341
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,000
some old clothes or your shoes and stuff.

342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Now, if you go red cross dot org, and it's given some money or some time and years,

343
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
that'd be so good if you could do that, he just be precious.

344
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,520
Cause they need some help, and I think we all ought to just lean into it and give them some help.

345
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,840
I'd really appreciate it, and I know they would, do you know what, as you would do?

346
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
Now, this is Richard Talbrath, a fern, and we're seeing.

347
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,720
Pot, Joe, content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

348
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,960
Yeah, this VT, here with you, Con, we're here to tell you about the gaming's edge, weekly round-up.

349
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,200
It's not your typical gaming podcast.

350
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,280
It's better than episode two of the Star Wars movies.

351
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,880
That's really not saying much, is it?

352
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,680
Unless anyone in the world thinks that the United States has the market cornered on reckless,

353
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
irresponsible behavior.

354
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,240
This flash jack, there's porn available for download.

355
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,680
This podcast by www.gamingzedge.com.

356
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,720
Okay, that promo was sent in by Michael.

357
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Who actually responded to my question about what DS was, and GBA,

358
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,040
he says the DS is the Nintendo DS, the latest handheld gaming device.

359
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
Letters DS refer to the system's dual screens.

360
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,640
And the GBA is the Game Boy Advance, which was Nintendo's previous handheld system,

361
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,320
still in the wild use by gamers and backwards compatible with original Game Boy games.

362
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
And he said, okay, now please play the damn promo.

363
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,920
So did that. Before that, of course, which you tall rather third, with another plea to help out

364
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,800
for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. I've got a great email about that as well.

365
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,240
From Daria Muirhead, I believe.

366
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,080
He says, my new podcast, boutique cafe is almost ready to launch.

367
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,800
We're doing a show late this week about Hurricane Katrina.

368
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
How people can help and get involved.

369
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,840
Our boutique selling community is vast and a big heart of the group.

370
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,920
Many of our fellow designers that we have known have lost their homes and all of their possessions.

371
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,160
Fellow designers have joined together to give from our hearts.

372
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,120
Please go to eBay and search boutique angels.

373
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
These talented designers are donating 100% of the proceeds

374
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,000
through the Verifiable eBay Charity Association of Mission Fish to Mercy Corps.

375
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,400
Hurricane Katrina Fund. These sellers are giving of their talents,

376
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,720
time and materials to make some beautiful boutique items.

377
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,280
So please ask your listeners to check the oxides out,

378
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,240
bid on some gorgeous one of a kind items to support Mercy Corps.

379
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,280
And those that need so much help right now.

380
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
And that's boutiquefade.com.

381
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Links, of course, in the show notes as a man, as it continues to really suck in New Orleans.

382
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,000
At part of Louisiana, Mississippi, Red Cross.org is where you can continue to go and donate money.

383
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,800
And if you have time and you can donate that to help, I think that's going to be very, very welcome.

384
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,400
It does seem like we have a lot of government resources coming into view now.

385
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,440
Big naval ship coming alongside. We've got some reserves.

386
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:23,200
Who aren't in Iraq coming in, but see, I think that this is a pretty big disaster.

387
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,440
And it's hard to get resources down there.

388
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,040
The news media are just now kind of really setting up big camps.

389
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,960
I'm not quite sure they knew what to think of it, but once again,

390
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
we only need to come together and help each other out.

391
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,520
I think the Red Cross is the best way to go.

392
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,280
Quick note from Bill Lefler on the biodiesel.

393
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,880
He says he loves the biodiesel idea about being able to crap in your tank.

394
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,720
I think we need to talk to Rota Router about some joint development of this technology.

395
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,600
I mean, if they're pumping this stuff out of my septic tank already, why can't they pump it back into my gas tank?

396
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,240
Of course, if the cooking oil biodiesel smells like french fries, dot, dot, dot.

397
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,440
It would be cool if that was actually possible. I would love it.

398
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,560
Okay, let's talk about the pod safe music network.

399
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,520
The last week was the last week.

400
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,920
It's more than more than a week and a half ago on boingboingboing.net.

401
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Cory Doctro posted a piece about the terms of use and the agreement terms for podcasters

402
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,200
at the pod safe music network at podsafemusic.network.com.

403
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,360
The piece that he wrote was poorly researched and poorly written.

404
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,400
I have to say they're all kinds of factual mistakes in there.

405
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:44,320
But he did have an interesting point that the terms basically limited free speech for podcasters

406
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,880
by saying that you're not allowed to talk about hacking or other illegal activity in your podcast.

407
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
And let me just tell you why and how and how we work at pod show.

408
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,040
First of all, the pod safe music network has been in data for a couple of weeks.

409
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,480
We actually had a closed data before that.

410
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,640
When we brought in six or seven music podcasters, we brought in,

411
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,560
well actually they brought in a number of artists and we beta tested the whole site.

412
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,720
And a big part of that beta test was actually also the terms and conditions.

413
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,040
And we did adjust some terms and conditions during that beta period.

414
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,440
So we've been in beta for about four weeks now.

415
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,840
And we're just about actually we put out a press release.

416
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,440
And over a thousand podcasters have signed up already.

417
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,920
Over a thousand artists, there's thousands of registered listeners.

418
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,560
It's really going quite well.

419
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,920
No one had complained about any of the terms or services.

420
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,720
And I believe we put out a press release saying,

421
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,960
you know, we're open for business, come on check it out.

422
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,400
And that's where Cory Doctro decided to go pick up the terms and conditions.

423
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,200
And so we made a posting about that on boingboing.net.

424
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,320
And obviously this, the start to get around and it came to our attention.

425
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,960
And we've been looking at it evaluating it, looking at the comments, talking to different folks.

426
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,520
And yesterday we were pretty much convinced that we had to make a change.

427
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,160
And so we did, which was very simple to do.

428
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:29,200
And we've actually removed the entire paragraph about what you can or cannot say on your podcast.

429
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,040
And we've replaced it.

430
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,920
Actually, I should let me just have the, uh, can I do this here?

431
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,080
Now, of course, the issue is if I open up my web browser.

432
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,640
Is it going to immediately break my recording? I guess not.

433
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm going to read the actual term to you.

434
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,680
So while that's loading and it's now is just turned into one sentence,

435
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,280
which I think everyone should be happy with.

436
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,880
If not, we'd obviously love to hear from you.

437
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
And that's the only thing that bothers me just a little bit.

438
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,000
You know, terms and conditions are, um, I mean, if you ever read the package of an end user

439
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,440
licensing agreement on a piece of software, um, then you probably be very scared to

440
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
Cory Doctro to spend some time on that.

441
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:18,320
Or even if you go over to, um, current TV, current dot TV, El Gore's project,

442
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,560
take a look at his terms and conditions.

443
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,120
You know what, take a look at garage bands, conditions.

444
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
They even own your RSS feed over a garage band.

445
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,520
But, you know, I, I understand that, uh, uh, lots of people want to scrutinize what we're doing.

446
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,000
So, uh, I'm happy to do that, but it would have been, it was a little disappointing that no one.

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,360
And I mean, absolutely no one emailed me, at least directly and said, hey, you know,

448
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,800
these terms and conditions, uh, maybe you should look at that, or can we, what do you mean by that?

449
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,760
Or why did you do this?

450
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,080
Uh, and I would have expected it from a site like Boeing Boeing, but, uh, no email from Cory.

451
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,280
And of course, I hope that he will pick this up, that we've changed it.

452
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,400
Here it is, uh, number eight.

453
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,000
So instead of, um, the stuff you can't say, we now have, in point eight, under the terms of conditions,

454
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
Podshow is not responsible for the content of the podcast on the network.

455
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,800
You acknowledge that you are fully responsible for your content and you acknowledge

456
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,800
that it is your responsibility to obtain any and all necessary licenses, rights, or grants,

457
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,800
for your podcast and any other material that is in it, you also agree in a knowledge that Podshow

458
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,880
will not act as an arbiter of any disputes and all claims are your sole responsibility.

459
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
So, there you go.

460
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,000
It was a very simple change to make and I like it.

461
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,640
Uh, we talked it over CC Chapman, he likes it, uh, and now would like to hear from you.

462
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,160
And actually, maybe we should put together some kind of independent committee for, um, uh,

463
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,560
for some of these things, um, you know, whatever it is, I think we can do a little bit better

464
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,800
than just rampantly posting all over the place.

465
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,440
You know, there was absolutely no, no discussion.

466
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,320
So, uh, but just, you know, we're kind of, the way it started to go is, you know,

467
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,040
these guys are evil and, you know, they're trying to dictate what you can say in your podcast.

468
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,480
We're not, we're just guys, you know, um, and we listen, it's that simple.

469
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,920
So you gave us the feedback, we listened, uh, we made a decision and I think, uh, I think we're

470
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
perfect now. And if not, just let us know, you know, this is, uh, this is the open web.

471
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,360
This is where we're supposed to be able to, to talk to each other and have opinions.

472
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,160
But, uh, got, got a little bit of ugly here and there. And I was a little disappointed by,

473
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,760
the way some people, uh, reacted in public and did nothing, absolutely nothing, um, you know,

474
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,320
no independent private, uh, communication. Anyway, so now you can say whatever you want.

475
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,400
And by the way, I was in violation of the terms of service all the time. So another reason they

476
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,800
definitely had to be changed. A quick email from James Martin, uh, because I was talking about

477
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,280
the video music awards the other day, says actually I found out that, uh, Diddy or Sean Combs

478
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,480
didn't give his watch to the guy in the audience at the MTV video music award. Well, he did,

479
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,200
but after that during the commercial break, a security guard came down asked him to take the watch

480
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,200
and then they gave the guy a watch, but it was a cheap knockoff of the actual one. I love that.

481
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,080
That's probably, uh, Diddy probably has, you know, knockoff watches of the watch that he wears,

482
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,960
that he's going to start selling. Oh, man. I was listening to the latest Bitty cast.

483
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:28,960
This is from them in Cambridge. And, um, I liked it a lot because they actually,

484
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,840
uh, they discovered that they were turning off the recording device at the most critical moments.

485
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,440
There was even a critical moment right there where they were fighting about who's going to carry the

486
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,360
eye river. I mean, is it that big? Is it that complicated? I guess no one wants to walk around with the

487
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,000
mic and look like a dork, uh, but it was beautiful to hear because finally there was a little bit of,

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,880
you know, a little bit of negative energy there in the in the Bitty camp. Not negative, but, you know,

489
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,960
just a little bit of caddy, caddy vibe. And I kind of, yeah, that did it for me. And then I was

490
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,760
listening, um, one of my favorite songs by the list of these Bitty's, um, they have a live recorded version.

491
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,080
It's an indirect recording. So it's basically just a mic hangin out there in thin air. So you can't

492
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,880
really hear it the way you'd like to hear live performance. But, um, I just want you to hear how great

493
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,240
these girls are live. Um, you know, Lee Ann just sings her ass off. Um, and, uh, you know, the

494
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,080
improvisations that she does, um, playing off the audience is great. And, and it's the whole thing is good.

495
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,520
So I want to play that. It's a famous, it's the Lassavius Bitties Live in Cambridge.

496
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,120
You can't tell me that you love a better way to play music or go to a music group.

497
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,000
Because I haven't yet experienced it. So thank you so much for welcoming us onto your stage.

498
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,840
Um, hopefully I will help in the road to making us famous. That's not so delicate,

499
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,600
safe way. The next song.

500
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,320
There is also on a t-shirt. Oh yeah, she must have a t-shirt.

501
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

502
00:26:49,840 --> 00:27:19,840
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

503
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Tell us my hand

504
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Hand me from that bridge to sign

505
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm gonna say some rebate

506
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Talk to my assistant

507
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
I want to be famous

508
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Tell my assistant what I need

509
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
She's up

510
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
I want to be famous

511
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Go and do what we do is on the streets

512
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Then you and I'm old

513
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
I have a bone

514
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Then be sure that I'm living it all

515
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,840
When I have to look yes we'll fall

516
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,840
To the knees

517
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
And then I'll slip across

518
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
What I'm gonna be used to

519
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,840
I want to go and do what I choose

520
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
When I'm very much able

521
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Same to the same

522
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Same to the other

523
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
I want to be famous

524
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,840
I want to be famous

525
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
I want to be famous

526
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,840
I want to be famous

527
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
I want to be famous

528
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
I want to be famous

529
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
I want to be famous

530
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
I want to be famous

531
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
I want to be famous

532
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
I want to be famous

533
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
I want to be famous

534
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
I want to be famous

535
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
I want to be famous

536
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
I want to be famous

537
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
I want to be famous

538
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
I want to be famous

539
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
I want to be famous

540
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
I want to be famous

541
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
I want to be famous

542
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
I want to be famous

543
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,840
I want to be famous

544
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
I want to be famous

545
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
I want to be famous

546
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I want to be famous

547
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
I want to be famous

548
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
I want to be famous

549
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
I want to be famous

550
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
I want to be famous

551
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
I want to be famous

552
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:24,840
It's no use at all, and I ain't as bad as I do, in dawn.

553
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,840
And every morning I'll get high on,

554
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Motherville's martini's dry,

555
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,840
A little wee and just a touch of glow.

556
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
I want to be famous, famous,

557
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Fair enough all my friends so much better than I would.

558
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,840
But it was a big slowly and a long time ago.

559
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,840
I ended up bitterly and old.

560
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Not just my body, but also my soul.

561
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,840
But a legend is my goal, and a legend I'll be.

562
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,840
When I'm bright, I'll be out here.

563
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,840
When I'm bright, I'll be out here.

564
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,840
When I'm bright, I'll be out here.

565
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,840
The Sylvia's Bitties Live in Cambridge.

566
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,840

Say whatever the heck you want.

574
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Just keeping with a couple of the topics we've been keeping up with this past week.

575
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Email, hi, I'm a 17 year old teen from Australia.

576
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Just wanted to pipe in the not all parents are horrible.

577
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Since I'm a fourth child, that's between parentheses and Catholics.

578
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
My parents are pretty much accepted.

579
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,840
I'm going to grow up, and that I just want my privacy.

580
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,840
That respect helps make a good relationship between my parents.

581
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
I just thought I would tell you that not all parents and teens hate each other.

582
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Oh, I don't think that they hate each other, of course not.

583
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,840
And Patricia and I are talking about this a lot these days about Christina,

584
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,840
who now says, I'm 15, so I'm going to do this this and that tomorrow.

585
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
I'm going to go here and stay overnight there.

586
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,840
You know, as scary as it is, we've got to, you know, let her go.

587
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
And find her own way.

588
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,840
We just hope we've given her enough ammunition.

589
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,840
So that, you know, when she gets into situations that she might know what to be

590
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,840
and that she either knows how to walk away from him, get out of him or,

591
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,840
and that's really the relationship I hope we have.

592
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
And it has proved to be that way, a couple times in the past.

593
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,840
This, that she knows to call us and say, hey, I'm not comfortable picking me up.

594
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,840
I have a rule, you know, it's like you can call me 24, 7, and you say,

595
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,840
picking me up and no questions asked, promise, no questions asked.

596
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
And that's the, that's the thing that my parents did with me,

597
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,840
and I really did appreciate it and use it only once or twice,

598
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
but it was well worth it.

599
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Okay.

600
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,840
Holy moly, already, I've been talking my ass off today,

601
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
30 minutes and not a lot of promos.

602
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,840
You know, what, let's do another piece of potsafe music here.

603
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,840
This is grittal, that's the band that Patricia likes so much.

604
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
This is another one of their tunes.

605
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
So, preoccupied.

606
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Because I don't want to treat you that way,

607
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,840
and if I'm not quick with a compliment,

608
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,840
I hope they can tend to have lost all to love.

609
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,840
I love you, find you, at least I'm sincerely,

610
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,840
love with what I love.

611
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,840
And if you question my intentions,

612
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,840
affection and man, I'm so time to know,

613
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,840
they do what they're so, I told you to submit me.

614
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Question what they love,

615
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,840
I wish I could be in one of my side,

616
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:24,840
and I always see you in me, I feel I'm trying to raise you.

617
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,840
I'm trying to above my mind, find you better than me,

618
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,340
dull or dull or dull or dull or dull,

619
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,840
dull or dull, dull or dull,

620
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
dull or dull or dull,

621
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,840
dull

622
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:24,840
I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling

623
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I'm telling you," I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you so I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm wondering I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you, I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I I'm telling you I'm telling you I I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I I Ki н't I'm telling you I'm telling you I Ki NK subway

624
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,700
There's one thing I forgot to mention about those terms and conditions, you know, the ones

625
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,720
that limited the podcast or I remember how it came up in beta testing, we got a couple

626
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:16,320
of questions from artists who said, well, what do I do if a hate podcast starts to use

627
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,720
my music?

628
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,880
How do I, you know, how do I prevent that from happening?

629
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,840
But that I think is where those terms and conditions came from, actually, meant well

630
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,280
to protect the artist, but of course, had an adverse effect for the podcasters.

631
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,480
That question does still remain open though.

632
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,760
Now, of course, the way it's written, you know, the license that is granted to you as a

633
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,080
podcaster by signing up can be revoked, I guess, and I'm not a lawyer, and this is all

634
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,640
just, you know, hypothetical shit, but we should talk about that.

635
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,200
I guess that, you know, it is, you can just go sue anyone for anything.

636
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,200
So I guess you could fix it in the end, but it's just a, it's a pain in the ass.

637
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,120
And you, you gotta have some terms and conditions.

638
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,720
I'm glad we got it all sorted out though, because it makes me feel much better, you know,

639
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,160
just knowing that we're all back on the same page.

640
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
And I, and I love this about the internet.

641
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,800
It reminded me of all the feedback we got when I did the hotel, which hotel was that in New

642
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
York.

643
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,840
It was, um, that old fancy schmancy, uh, it's now a Hilton, uh, I can't recall.

644
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,600
Uh, so I was writing up and down the elevators, doing a sound scene tour, and then

645
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,480
people said, well, you know, you're really recording without permission.

646
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,840
And, uh, so I, you know, I'm sorry, fixed it, and won't do it anymore.

647
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,240
So in the same, same case here, sorry.

648
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,400
We, uh, we overlooked it, didn't think about it enough, and we're all good to go.

649
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
SCC would say, it's all good.

650
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:50,680
Oh, I'm counting casting with Adam Curry, I suppose you think you got it in his room.

651
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Is he puking again?

652

Oh, thank you.

658
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,720
So don't worry about, uh, the smell of my breath.

659
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,200
It's Thursday morning, it's been 45, and I've got a new hit test for you.

660
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,880

665
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,040
Can't miss it.

All of them circles can feel, which is nothing.

679
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,200
It's no love, you can love, you can love, you will find it.

681
