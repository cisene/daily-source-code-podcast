1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, 1 9 or 7.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,900
On Show.com, makes no claims regarding the quality of its hot chillers or the sanity

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,900
of its producers.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,500
Listen at your own risk.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,620
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:31,500
content in my ears.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,100
Hey everybody, how you doing?

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,500
This is a remote broadcast of the source code.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,660
I wanted to make a point, wanted to prove it to myself, but I could actually take my

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,860
entire kit out on the road, and be completely mobile, something that would take tens

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,660
of thousands of dollars to do if you're a professional broadcast or the professional setup.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,260
I'm sitting in the downs with my crap list.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,940
I mean literally, I am sitting here on the downs, I think I've explained that that's kind

14
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,620
of like a grassy meadows that go first, just hundreds of miles all the way from where

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,420
we live down to the shore, and I'm sitting in the middle of the menow talking into the on-board

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,620
microphone of my crap list, which actually sounds, I think, better than the headset microphone

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,620
that I normally use.

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,060
Of course, I'm missing a little bit of low end there, a little bit of resonance, but

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,740
I think it'd be kind of fun to check it out.

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,740
Today is June 21st, 2005.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,060
Wait a minute, doesn't summer officially start today?

22
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,060
Is that the deal?

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,060
Some like that, at least.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,420
The future comes home today, so that'll be nice looking forward to that.

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,140
Actually, I've loaded everything up for yesterday's source code.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,980
I've loaded up a course on running this on task last year, the, just in the screen.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:57,140
A task last year, data 15, which has all the tricky limit of stuff in there, so I really

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,700
don't have to do much more than just hit the, just hit the buttons at the right time to

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,060
fire off the sound sequences.

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,900
It's really quite enjoyable.

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,660
Okay, we're going to kick it off today with a mashup.

32
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,460
This is, let me see, Tagan, Sarah versus Milo, walking with a ghost in Paris.

33
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,460
I think Dylan Joyett.

34
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:31,460
Meanwhile, I'm going to have a sip of tea and roll one up.

35
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:24,460
I'm going to have a sip of tea and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up and roll one up

41
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:24,460
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

42
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,860
first 2005 coming to you from the downs behind the cottage.

43
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,660
Let me just stand up for a second and give you a little... I'll turn around here and

44
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,060
I'll just do a 360 so you can hear the sounds from all over hold on.

45
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,660
I'm sure you can hear the birds. You can also probably hear the fan of the

46
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,660
craplet going nuts. So this is actually working out very well. I'm quite impressed

47
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,060
with at least we're not really the depth of the sound of this little hole that's in my

48
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,860
screen but the fact that the compressor limiter functions of cast blasts are really

49
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,660
pulling up the voice enough to make it work. As I said, I was planning on

50
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,460
doing this last night on the train. It was been a great weekend. Patricia was

51
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,860
off to visit her family. So Christina and I were home alone and I had lots and

52
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,060
lots of podgeo business, lots of interesting people we've been talking to, lots

53
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,860
of great stuff coming up very soon. And then last night I went to London,

54
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:32,260
a guy named Rom Shuri Rom who's definitely Silicon Valley insider was in London

55
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,020
for Wimbledon which of course is kicked off. And so I had dinner with him and we

56
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,780
chat it a bit. He was one of the... I think it's one of the initial investors in

57
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,220
Google. Very interesting guy. And so we had a nice chat and I was planning on

58
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,140
doing the source code on the train ride home and I got the... the 10... what is it?

59
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:58,220
The 1030 train? No, yeah 1030 train which got me into Gilford at 1103 but it

60
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,780
was actually was quite packed and of course I felt a little bit to self-conscious to

61
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,580
be sitting on the train talking into my laptop and loud tones. So I think maybe

62
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,540
I should not do that. But I had everything loaded up anyway and oh man we've had

63
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,980
such a heat wave here. It's so incredibly warm, 91, 92 degrees which is

64
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,540
beautiful of course although none of the English infrastructure or the British

65
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,180
infrastructure is set up for this type of weather so there's no air conditioning.

66
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,420
The studio, the daily source code studio is freaking hot my friends. It's not

67
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:38,420
all good at CC would say. It's you know I've got fans and everything go on and

68
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,300
it's just not helping so particularly with some of the equipment that's in there.

69
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,220
I've got three or four machines, three or four computers running and well

70
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,860
talk about the tube amp, the preamp that I use which has tubes in it which

71
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,980
actually generate heat. That's part of what they do. So it's just almost

72
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,340
unbearable. So I figured I'd just sit out here on the downs and use the

73
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,940
crap foot for the source code. Let me see what I'm going to talk about. Oh

74
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,940
whimbleed it. So whimbleed in. The television over here is doing some pretty

75
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:13,620
amazing shit. The BBC has 52 cameras and you know a multitude of microphones

76
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,180
and angles and when you switch on and we have sky digital which is basically it's

77
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,460
a satellite service so you get your 999 channels of which 300 a

78
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:31,700
porn starting at 700. But when you tune into BBC 1 you can press the red button

79
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,260
and then you can actually select which court you want to watch which is

80
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,140
fascinating stuff. It really works too. You know there's a little delay and when

81
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,100
it first loads up all the different screen shots. So you have an overview screen.

82
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,740
You can look at all the court simultaneously and you can switch between them.

83
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,260
It's really it's you know they're really doing some progressive stuff here.

84
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,300
It's it's pretty interesting. Oh boy there's so much to talk about. Oh wait a

85
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,780
minute. Got something very important here. Hold on. See I don't really have a

86
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,860
stand. I'm trying to I'm trying to use my knees to pop up. Can you can just hear

87
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,620
how cheap this tablet is. Hey there pure plastic everybody. This is something

88
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,180
that I should have talked about last week but it unfortunately was still on the

89
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,620
pile and I picked it up yesterday. Congratulations to the Wesowitz family.

90
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,580
Rick Wesowitz we've talked about him before on on the source code. He it does the

91
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:30,500
ICM raw podcast as well as all the technology and engineering. I believe for

92
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,500
WGBH's morning stories because there's a new addition to the family. Matthew

93
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,460
James Wesowitz was born on the 15th of June. 24 p.m. seven pounds three ounces.

94
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,220
20 and a half inches. Deliberat via cesarean section. Mom is fair.

95
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,820
Data's tired. Matthew is just fine. Thought you'd want to know. It says Rick.

96
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,140
Well congratulations Rick. To you your wife and your family couldn't be happier.

97
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,820
That's awesome news dude. Hoops. That's awesome news dude. Here comes.

98
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,100
Hi Adam. This is Karina. Oh my god. I'm speaking to the pot father and so nervous.

99
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,220
Okay, please add them. Listen to the following announcement. It's important. Very

100
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,580
important. Hi Adam. This is Thomas. You know the man with a Pope voice from Germany.

101
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:21,100
Today I would like to announce sushi radio.com. What's that?

102
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,260
It will blow the top 10 of podcasting away. But in a good way.

103
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,180
Podcasts we call them sushi makers all over the world are sending us their sushi's.

104
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:40,380
This is Delphine for sushi radio. This is bicycle mark with you live from Amsterdam

105
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,300
from the hourd kite mark. This is for sushi radio. One is Lloyd Davis and I

106
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:53,020
log in podcast from Perfect Path.head of UK. I'm based in London in the UK.

107
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:02,380
I'm doing this short podcast point for sushi radio.com today.

108
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:11,020
So little time. So many podcasts. Head over to sushi radio.com and find delicious

109
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,060
tidbits for your ears and your listening pleasure. Go sushi radio.com.

110
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:23,340
People can send us sushi's about topics they are passionate about. So listen to sushi radio

111
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,900
to get a sound collage of our world. Do you like this Adam? Okay the guys from sushi radio told me

112
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,940
I should ask you for a sushi. Maybe some sound seeing in gulfod. Maybe something special

113
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,700
from Dutch history. Whatever you want. They are just two rules. Not more than 10 minutes.

114
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,900
And at the beginning please say this is Adam Perry for sushi radio. Just send it to

115
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:51,340
sushi radiomail at gmail.com. Hope you are joining us at sushi radio. Bye bye.

116
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,460
Okay sushi radio. I'm a little conflicted about that. I don't know about calling podcasts.

117
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,140
Especially because I had sushi last night at a wonderful restaurant Zuma. It's the name of it.

118
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,580
And some nice tempura. I could go on about that. Was it on Friday? I think we talked about

119
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,860
why is it that whenever someone calls you in the middle of the night and they wake you up

120
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,260
and they say did I wake you? The first thing that usually comes out of your mouth is no not at all when

121
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,900
it's a total fucking blatant lie. Wilson Alfonso sent me some little emails. When someone calls

122
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,220
and asks me the question, my favorite answer is no no I just welcome up to answer the phone.

123
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,700
That makes sense. Okay let me say I got a whole bunch of printed out emails here.

124
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,980
And then I wanted to take care of let me say no. Here's something we got to talk about.

125
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:51,100
The Apple iTunes 4.9 launch which of course includes podcasting. That's going to be soon.

126
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,820
I don't have an exact date yet but I would say within the next two weeks probably. Maybe even less than that.

127
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:06,300
And one of the parts of this innovation really in podcasting is this giant leap forward that we're

128
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,980
about to make. As I think it's 38 million desktop have iTunes and they will all be prompted to

129
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:18,940
upgrade to receive the podcast functionality. I think that's really exciting. Is that Apple is going to

130
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:27,020
release a name space. They're extending RSS with a name space which will allow for certain tags,

131
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,980
certain synopsisies to be entered. Stuff the will of course completely work with with iTunes.

132
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,580
And they're doing it in a valid way as far as I can tell by creating a name space. Now there's

133
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:45,020
a pod name space. So you'll see tag showing up in these feeds as pod colon and then whatever the

134
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,500
tag happens to be. So there's one if you do not want to be included in the iTunes music store.

135
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,140
So that's an opt out feature in that case which in my mind means that everyone's going to be in and

136
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,580
we have been working very closely on helping Apple get all of our directory information.

137
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,820
They are going to reorganize it but of course that's how an open directory works. Still no

138
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,780
word on if they're going to open up an open mail back end to their directory but I am pushing

139
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,540
for because that would of course be the right thing to do to feed that back into the community.

140
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,580
So that's one. There'll also be an explicit tag and a couple others that works specifically

141
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,780
within with an iTunes. So as soon as I have information away you could find the name space

142
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,500
document of course I will put it on query.com and I'm sure Apple will be announcing that as well.

143
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,060
So be on the lookout. Adam I'm doing it and I'm about and we've got a new podcast more hip and

144
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:49,500
hip-ing we promise no granola no patchouli no the earth is doomed and we're not going to have sex.

145
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,020
What what no no what other we're all about living happy.

146
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:13,900
You want to be good to your favorite planet but I'm a part of our human.

147
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:21,180
Your father said that she's made a forget it caught in you used to know why but now you forgot

148
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:28,620
and you traded your suburb and for a hybrid car you're more hip than hip you know who you are.

149
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,340
Oh man we make it so easy. How about us two chicks can do it anybody can. We want to make a

150
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,820
field guilty you probably already have somebody in your life that does that for you. So check us out

151
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:45,500

152
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,900
Thanks Adam. Sure girls you sure you don't want to have sex with each other on the podcast please

153
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,180
please kind of hung up please. Okay guess not oh you know what couple drawbacks here now that I'm laying

154
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,660
in the meadows of the downs one it's getting hot and the time right now is 1053 AM and it's really

155
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,340
heating up so I'm starting to perspire another drawback is and of course this is a drawback with

156
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:13,580
all laptops and computer screens very hard to see the screen with the wind maybe if I turn around

157
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:19,500
well I could face directly into the sun but then it's getting even hotter. Oh boy but the proof

158
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,500
is in the pudding we can actually do remote broadcast this way and it's all in there it's fucking great

159
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,140
I love it so we are in the final throws of getting ready for the public beta release of cast

160
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,620
blaster beta number 15 I think we'll do a beta number 16 which has a few more tweaks and

161
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,700
improvements that cast blaster mic was working on so far though I'm just totally delighted with the

162
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:48,140
results and so that will be a version that you will be able to download there will be an extended trial

163
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,300
period for you to try it out and and actually I believe if we think it's good enough we're going to

164
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,500
sell this version which will be a completely independent and you'll be able to use it with you know

165
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,260
basically any any way you want to to create your RSS feeds and any way you want to put your podcast

166
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,180
of course the version after that we'll have all of that built in automatically. She sent me

167
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:18,620
touching me I'm taking that feels good. She's the middle. We're driving from Florida home. She has her hand

168
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,340
down your pants I guess yes. Do you like trying to talk to the family because that'd be hot.

169
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,780
You know her hand but I don't want to stop I can't hold it back and then finally I'm

170
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,300
being in her hand. Do you remember like times were like close to getting caught but not like they

171
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,380
caught me off card like some of these coming down the steps and great that I'm not a little boy

172
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,020
18 and some cultures consider that being a man and I mean I'm in big going on finishing the race.

173
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,820
I'm like let's see if I will do it all and then you got to talk to me but only one hand is free.

174
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,380
Hi could you hear me a towel or not my towel I guess a shirt because I'm normal just hand it to me.

175
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:21,100
I didn't know the etiquette. So I say thank you could I rub your arm while you're doing it. I like that human

176
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:29,580
touch. I think the circle. You know I hadn't heard Keith in the girl yet I'd heard a lot about him

177
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,580
and after I heard this promo I immediately subscribed to the show very good I like it a lot

178
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:40,780
excellent excellent podcast. I'm not going to say something that just slipped my mind. Shoot I don't know

179
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,180
let me read another piece of mail here. This is from Keith Moreno. He says it's been a locker on the

180
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,660
daily source code for about six months. I've been using podcasts from my online tech classes and

181
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,260
started my own that I'm rolling out very soon. I'm trying to figure out the best format right now.

182
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,260
Podcasts and education provides another way to connect with your students. My students love him. Keith

183
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,780
says the last quarter the number one comment I got was how they enjoyed listening to my podcast. I've

184
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,340
now included them in a class. I just developed as a weekly commentary on the topics on a discussion.

185
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,180
I never see my students face to face so this provides a way for them to feel a part of the learning

186
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:16,940
community. This is great and I'm hopeful that well even with stuff like cast blastering and we

187
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,140
can make it easier for education to jump on this. This is just who man the possibilities are so

188
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,220
freaking endless when it comes to this stuff I'm excited about it. Oh I know what I was going to say

189
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,100
Michael Butler, the Rock and Roll Geek Show, Rock and Roll Geek.com. Now you know that Steve

190
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,380
leads from a serious satellite and I have been working on hooking him up with an interview with Joan

191
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,540
Jet which Joan is doing nothing absolutely nothing won't speak to anybody at the time being.

192
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,180
So we kept pushing and Michael kept pushing and well so we got Joan's manager for an interview

193
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:53,180
which was supposed to be like a 10 minute deal and is this Kenny Laguna who at one point actually

194
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:59,500
was my manager in the MTV days and Kenny is Kenny and his lovely wife, Merrill, there are

195
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,700
trip man they've been managing Joan for since I don't know 1979 or 1980 and the interview was absolutely

196
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,900
fantastic. Talking about the old days of rock and roll Kenny also played in Tommy James and the

197
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,940
Sean Dells you remember Moni Moni was a big hit before Billy Idol, read it of course.

198
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,980
He talks about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and how it's kind of rigged. That's typical Kenny

199
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,980
you will enjoy that it's the most recent episode of the Rock and Roll Geek Show. It's a three

200
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:35,660
parter so make sure you catch it. Potset music now it's a speak of clay and she said on your

201
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,660
daily source code for Tuesday June 21st 2005.

202
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:06,220
It's a lot to go fast. I don't care as long as I have it here that's enough nothing more than

203
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:50,980
what she said.

204
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:27,220
All the time, I ask you to see a dead city

205
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:36,220
The sun, the night is gone, take a bus, I don't care which one is out of here

206
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:43,220
That's enough, nothing more would you know, that's it

207
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:52,220
She said, she said, we love you forever

208
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,220
She said, she said, we love you forever

209
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:05,220
All the time, all the time, all the time

210
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,220
All the time, all the time

211
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:22,220
All the time, all the time

212
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,220
She said, feed of clay on your daily source code

214
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Pretty well established actually, feed of clay is

Inside in the show notes for today's daily source code

217
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Something else really cool going on, Spike Lee is working on a new movie

218
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Which will star big names this time, Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster

219
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,220
And he's doing pre-production in New York as we speak

220
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,220
And it looks like we're going to be making a podcast out of that

221
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,220
So look forward to that, and of course I'll be back tomorrow on your daily source code

So I hope the sound of the microphone didn't put you off too much

223

Again, I'm just talking to a pinhole in the lid of my computer

224

And I have some kind of warning message

248
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
What do I have to do?

249
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
