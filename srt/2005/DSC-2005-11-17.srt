1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,920
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-8-1 The West, in the last few days when the surge of civilization

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,040
pushed on with to broader horizons, an almighty breed of man rested new life from the

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:27,320
wilderness. But, close on the pioneer trail, came the Renegade Horde, land sharks,

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,200
dry women, cattle thieves, terrorizing settler and tribesmen alike, until one man rose to

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,080
challenge their lawlessness. His face masked, his true identity unknown. A company always

6
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,880
by a faithful Indian companion, it funded across the frontier, appearing out of nowhere

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:57,120
just like down in justice, is fine, a silver bullet, is name. Adam Kurran, Kurri was $60 million

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,800
worth of airplane strapped to my ass. Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,840
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:17,680
Hey, everybody, how are you doing? Welcome to the Kurri Kondo. It's Thursday. Technically, it's

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
Thursday that is. Well, let me see, how's that? I peed up, said I was a little bit hot on the

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,680
last show, so I want to make sure I don't overmodulate. It is technically Thursday because

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,920
it's past midnight. Once again, I feel so incredibly behind the rest of the world, because

14
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,400
of course, the rest of the world is already up and at them, at least not in the United States,

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,640
but in Europe, which I consider to be the rest of the world. I think maybe I should consider

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,640
doing the show at night when I'm on the west coast, so that we can kind of be in sync,

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,760
because I'm sure that you're one, if not two days behind on the show, just because of when I

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,520
release them and when you're able to get them. That's just a hunch I have.

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,520
So this will be my Thursday show, and yeah, so Friday I can do a show because I arrive Friday

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:17,440
morning in the UK. Great. I'll be completely rective of course, but I'll do it. As you can tell,

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,560
I'm on the Highell microphone. This is the PR-40. The PR-40, the Pro-40. I can't remember.

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
I love this microphone, not getting paid for that. I'll tell you, I love it with

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm getting paid for it or not. Same with everything on the show. But I haven't noticed one drawback.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,720
I have one of these, one is like a cast iron foot with a little mic stand, and I screwed the

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,400
mic on top of that. But it's too low to use in my normal configuration in front of the the

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,000
I-Mac on the kitchen bar. And I can't tilt the back, because if I tilt the back, then this mic

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,480
is so massive, so heavy, then the mic continuously falls over backwards. And also, because I just

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,760
stuffed my AKG mic into my bag without bringing the handy little box. That was the perfect height to

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,520
extend the mic stand. So what I've done now is I'm sitting on the couch. By the way, I've already

30
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,320
dropped ashes on the couch, and of course, it's made a nasty stain, but Trisha's going to freaking

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:32,480
kill me. Let me just see. It's like, it's a suede. It's a suede couch.

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,440
And that has some kind of scotch guard on it, but there's still you can see a little spot there,

33
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,160
so that by anyway, I've drawn the living room table towards me, and it's a glass table top.

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,560
There you go. And I've put the effects processor on that, put the mixer, the little sound

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,000
craft mixer on top of that, and the mic stand is also on top of this 19-inch rack thing.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,440
Oh, man, I saw, did I tell you that that I saw? There's awesome mixer on podcast rigs.com.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,880
Let me see if I can bring that up, hold on. Oh, man, that was so incredibly cool.

38
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:16,960
This is exactly what I need. Let me see, pod. I think it's oops, podcast rigs.com. There we go.

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,200
Hold on. Check this out. It's exactly what the model is.

40
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,280
It's a little portable mixer, and it has basically two faders on it. One for your microphone,

41
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,960
and it has everything you'd want in the microphone. It has a preamp, it has phantom power, it has,

42
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,120
hold on. I got the specs right here. It's the rammy PGO 550 Pro mixer. I know this is geeky,

43
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:50,000
but man, this thing is what I've been looking for. Here we go. Specifically, a stereo line signal,

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,240
a balanced mic, and auxiliary balanced line signals can be mixed and routed to a computer via USB.

45
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,520
The mixer also includes phantom power, equalizer, limiter, balanced stereo output, and a balanced

46
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,320
channel insert for voice processing. God, this thing is exactly what I need for the road,

47
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,360
and then all I need is just a very small portable effects processor for the microphone,

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,240
and then I'm set, and then you know, man, I'll have such a beautiful compact system. That'll be just awesome.

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,920
So tomorrow, I fly home. I get picked up at 145 here at the condo, and then it's upper class,

50
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:32,160
all the way home, baby, but to see the girls who actually will be taking off for the weekend,

51
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,720
that's a secret they're going to go surprise. Patricia's dad for his 80th birthday.

52
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm staying home, because someone has to stay with the dogs in the cats in the house,

53
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,080
and whatever our dogs are, both our dogs are getting up there in age, and one just had some kidney,

54
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,080
stone removal. It wasn't really stones, but it was kind of like kidney dust or whatever,

55
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:04,080
so poor Jesse. Anyway, so it's been extremely productive. Of course, I, you know,

56
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,040
like I was in Seattle, and that was great, and today, which was, especially was cool,

57
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,400
is that I did the show on Wednesday, so I didn't have a show to do this morning, and I got to the

58
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,120
office, actually it was nice to slip until 8 o'clock. That was fantastic. Then I got to the office,

59
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:29,680
and I ran and I hooked up with Chris, Brian, and Rosie, and we were all in the new space,

60
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,720
which is coming along, and of course, I've leaned against all the walls, and I've paint everywhere,

61
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:42,640
I'm a sweater, I'm a pants, I'm a jacket, such as spas. Then I had it off for the valley,

62
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,320
because we had a couple of really, it was, they was rocket science day, rocket scientists day, actually.

63
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,280
First, we had lunch with the rocket scientists, and it's lovely wife, and that was in Palo Alto.

64
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,400
Was it Palo Alto? Yeah, it was in Palo Alto then, and this was extremely cool. We went over to

65
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,720
a mountain view for a meeting at Google. Then I was pretty excited, and I've never been to Google,

66
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,280
and I forgive you here so much about the culture and what it's like over there, and everyone's

67
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,720
really, really smart, and we had, you know, some of the top people in the company to talk with,

68
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,720
but, oh, dude, smart, smart, smart people. Jesus Christ, and focused, really, and this was,

69
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,760
I mean, it was just so refreshing to, you know, to feel that vibe. There's like,

70
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,960
what can I say? It's a real, it's not a warm, fuzzy vibe, it's like a

71
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,000
work-kick-and-ass vibe, you can really feel that. You can feel that when a company is breathing that,

72
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,480
and what was cool, though, is that all the people that we, I think was, there were four people

73
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,960
in the room, and Ron and I were both together on this meeting and Chris went along.

74
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,440
Is that they had all watched me on MTV, and they were actually, they said, oh, man,

75
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,600
I'm almost nervous to be in the room with you, because they, you know, when they were 12 or 13,

76
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,960
they had watched me on MTV. Oh, my goodness, that was very flattering, of course.

77
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,680
Okay, what's really good, though, about a day like today, and we go into the valley,

78
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,200
and then we actually went back to, would we go from there? Oh, man, I remember any more.

79
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,720
And we went back to Paula Walter to San Hill Road to

80
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,360
kind of Perkins meeting some people that basically using the office there, because it was in the neighborhood,

81
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,280
and this pertains to the PDN. Oh, man, we've got so much cool stuff to talk about.

82
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,920
Jesus Christ, we got the stuff's really going to start coming now.

83
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,360
What was it looking for over here? What I'm saying is that it's such an effective use of our

84
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,880
time, because basically Ron and I are in the car for at least an hour. Now, the cell phone coverage,

85
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,920
for some reason, where this is in San Hill Road is where all these venture capital companies are,

86
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,040
and everyone knows it's like the best kept secret that that is almost a dead zone for any cell

87
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,080
phone carrier in the world. But that does make it nice because no calls are coming through,

88
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,440
and we actually had some real good quality time to just talk about what's going on, without interruption.

89
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,000
And we talked, I'd have to say 99% of the time about the pod safe music network, about what I talked

90
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,960
about on a yesterday show, about selling MP3s, and let me tell you, we're now looking for

91
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,640
what we're hiring. We're going to get this done. This is a great idea. So we're doing a number of

92
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:48,080
things in parallel. At the same time, there's so many new bands pouring into the pod safe music network,

93
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,640
everyone's catching on to this. And please, artists, record something, give me some feedback.

94
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,440
I want to hear what you're thinking. I want to go through the Gmail with you, because that's

95
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:09,280
always a good way to excuse me. You want to play song first? Let me say, oh man,

96
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm totally disorganized, really, really disorganized. What is this? I don't want that.

97
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,120
I just like to play a song. I think that'll be kind of cool. What are we talking about the other

98
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,840
day? I had dinner with the Big Mike and Sue and Chris Rockwell. Oh yeah, we were talking about

99
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,480
the muffs. I'll play some muffs, and then we'll go through the Gmail and go through some of the

100
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,760
feedback and the excellent comments I'm getting on, pure pod safe pod casting.

101
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,800
How sharp crap that sucked ass.

102
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,760
That's the feeling that you're all I need

103
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,760
You get all my everything I do

104
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,760
But I can only get you in my ear

105
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,760
And I need a little opportunity

106
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,760
With your arms around me

107
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,760
And the feeling that you're all I need

108
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,760
I'm the great, the I care

109
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
And I'm forever

110
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,760
And I need a little opportunity

111
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,760
With your arms around me

112
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,760
And the feeling that you're all I need

113
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,760
I need a little opportunity

114
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,760
With your arms around me

115
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,760
And the feeling that you're all I need

116
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,760
And the feeling that you're all I need

117
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,760
And the feeling that you're all I need

118
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Yeah, I need a little opportunity

119
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
The pot's a music network

120
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
I've got so many cool bands in there

121
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,760
I have this theory about social network

122
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
I can't get enough of them

123
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
I have this theory about social networks

124
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Social networks like my space

125
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
What else is there?

126
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
There's a friendster

127
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,760
And there's another one

128
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Well, there's a whole thing you know what I'm talking about

129
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
Is that these things basically

130
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
You can architect them over and over again

131
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
You can try and make something that you know

132
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Build it and then expect them to come

133
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
But what happens is what I've seen happen

134
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Time and time again is that

135
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
One little community will

136
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Start doing something

137
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
And as long as you start bringing in features

138
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Listening and feeding back and being a part of that community

139
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Then you build it out

140
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Now it's not necessarily an all-encompassing thing

141
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
For instance, my space is really built around

142
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Music and music videos that have to say

143
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Mainly and you're seeing mainstream bands

144
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Now release their music on my space

145
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
That's an incredible phenomenon

146
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,760
And I think that we'll definitely be working with my space

147
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
One way the other is just it's unavoidable

148
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Those guys have got something really good going on

149
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
And it's what Chris and Tom, you know, those guys are smart

150
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
And they get it, they totally get it

151
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Now you take something like a friendster

152
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Which was a social network

153
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Which I think was built from the ground

154
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
I think was built from the ground up with the idea of

155
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Okay, we're going to build a social network

156
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
And we're going to make all the technology right

157
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
And what happened is

158
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
A community from Manila

159
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Started to use it and you know, so they have lots of users

160
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
But they're all from the Philippines

161
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,760
And it kind of gets stuck that way, you know

162
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
It's very hard to bring in other communities

163
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Once your community is started to grow

164
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
I'm trying to think there was another great example of that

165
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Who was telling me about Brazil

166
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
There was some other social network

167
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
That had been lingering around for a while

168
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
All sudden Brazil started to use it

169
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Gosh, I'm real fuzzy, I'm sorry I can't remember what it was

170
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,760
So that's what I'm seeing happening here with the Podsake music network

171
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,760
And I'm quite confident now that this is going to be a big

172
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Well, we kind of knew it and we worked on it

173
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
I mean the Podsake music network was, you know, built months and months

174
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
And months ago and before that even was a pod show

175
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
We were already working on this because it's funny

176
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
I wonder what started us on that

177
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I guess we got the music podcasters together

178
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Oh man, who cares?

179
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Let's look forward instead of backwards

180
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Oh, here's something interesting

181
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Magic gave me an emergency phone call, Adam Adam, come me

182
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Apparently we've had our first victim of

183
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,760
Well, I can only presume it's a business model that is not working for them at least

184
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,760
In Pod casting, pure cast where apparently

185
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,760
I don't know how many people they were hosting on their servers

186
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
But it was under 50 I believe

187
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Including 10 to 20 queue potters

188
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,760
All of a sudden, these guys just turned everything off

189
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
The website is for sale, the domain name

190
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
For just under 2,000 bucks

191
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,760
And everyone's shit is gone and it's over

192
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
And so, Madge called me and said, Adam, Adam, I want to get to do this

193
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Well, Madge, come on, bring them on over

194
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,760
We haven't opened up the podcast delivery network yet

195
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,760
But, you know, I think we can park these folks in some space that will work

196
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
And we'll get them up and running

197
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
It also includes soccer girl incorporated

198
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
So we're jumping in and getting them all hooked up

199
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
So for those of you who are missing a number of queue potters

200
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Podcasts, excuse me

201
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,760
As well as soccer girl incorporated

202
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
It's being taken care of and hopefully everything will be up to tomorrow

203
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
We probably won't be able to redirect their feeds

204
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Unless they're using feed burner then we can then the feeds will remain the same

205
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,760
But we'll help them publish their new feeds

206
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
So that sucks when that happens

207
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
That bites, hey that

208
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Okay, let's look at my daily source code label

209
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Here in Gmail

210
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Okay, let me see

211
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Right off the bat, we've got a comment about ID3 tags

212
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
I'm just going to play whatever pops up

213
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
If I don't like it, I'll shut it off

214
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Hey Adam, I've heard you complain about people not putting the information that you want

215
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
In the ID3 tags, but you have to tell us what information you want

216
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,760
So, let's start with my proposal for a basic ID3 tagging standard

217
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
First of all, comments

218
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Title field should be CMT followed by RECOLIN, just like an email

219
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,760
And then either a show number, DSE number, or a specific topic

220
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,760
A promo will be given the prefix in the title field of promo colon

221
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,760
And for pod safe music, PSM at the beginning of the title field

222
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
As far as pod safe music goes, all the other fields should be left as they are

223
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
Continuing the information with the pertain to the song

224
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,760
And any other information should be added into the comments or lyrics

225
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Fields of the ID3 tag

226
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,760
And then going back to comments and promos, we'll say the artist's field

227
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Should be an email address and the album field should be a website address

228
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
And or pod cast feet, if available

229
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Anyone taking notes on this?

230
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,760
If this system wouldn't work for your production system, let us know what would work

231
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Yeah, and if you're not going to plug my podcast, the high-ponency music podcast

232
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,760
You can check it out at feeds.feetburner.com slash hotel pop a mic test

233
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Or www.highponencymusic.com

234
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Thank you

235
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
That's a great idea

236
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
But I don't think anyone's going to do it

237
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Email from audio collective, great show Adam, one comment about

238
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,760
It's a danger mouse song, I don't think it was danger mouse, it was danger

239
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Something else that I played, it was a danger mouse yesterday

240
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
It was that hip-hop song

241
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,760
The record label, epitaph, is pronounced

242
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Like the saying that is on a gravestone, so it is epitaph

243
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Like they did it themselves, we'll soon be the music industry's epitaph

244
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Also check out Joe Stromer, oh that's right, oh man

245
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
I gotta get my act together on this

246
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,760
You remember the clash don't you, oh Joe Stromer from the clash

247
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Through epitaph records is now on the pod safe music network

248
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
And I'm going to play this song right now

249
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
How fucking cool is this

250
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Just give me a tequila

251
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
I'll slam it the pod the way

252
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,760
When I got there you know

253
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,760
It hurt

254
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Certain similarities

255
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Like no smoking anywhere

256
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
And hiding in the cosy to avoid man

257
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
The best

258
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
For the tequila anyone

259
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
And don't think we didn't dance

260
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Direct us by no different dimension

261
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
And the disc was still

262
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Like the black coat

263
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
And it was pretty got out as it is

264
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,760
And on the illness that I've met

265
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
And on the illness that I've met

266
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,760
And on the illness that I've met

267
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,760
And on the illness that I've met

268
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Like we're cleaning to the theme park

269
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
But just you're right

270
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
For the bench I'll climb

271
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Make up all right

272
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Well I was feeling tired

273
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Back and forth

274
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
And tired

275
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,760
And mathematics and pride

276
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
And tired

277
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
We've gone wrong

278
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,760
We've gone wrong anyway

279
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Just like the other

280
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Some world

281
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Yeah, that's not something

282
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
But always

283
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Yeah, we've gone wrong

284
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
And you will lose this way

285
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Yeah, that's how the next room is today

286
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Yeah, that's not something

287
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Yeah, that's not something

288
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
But always

289
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
Yeah, we've gone wrong

290
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
And you will lose this way

291
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Yeah, that's how the next room is today

292
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
But always

293
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
And it's time

294
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
We've gone wrong anyway

295
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
Wow, you know, at first when the song just started

296
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
I was like, oh man, don't tell me that this

297
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Joe Stromer song is going to suck ass

298
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Yeah, I would feel bad turning it off

299
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
But I liked it

300
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
It really opened up at the end

301
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
That was awesome

302
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,760
And this is not working out with with a laptop

303
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
And my head has to be twisted

304
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Oh, I met Steve Harris at

305
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
At the expo last weekend

306
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,760
And he said that he had switched from British airways

307
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
to Virgin Atlantic

308
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
He didn't fly up her class

309
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
But he switched to Virgin Atlantic

310
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Based upon my ranting and raving about how good the services

311
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
And mind you

312
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
I've flown Virgin Atlantic in

313
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
What is the, well they call that

314
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Not the, you have like a middle class

315
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
It's not business class

316
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Because you know

317
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Ah, executive class

318
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Maybe that's what it is

319
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
So it is definitely more expensive than

320
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Then economy

321
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,760
But you do get a really nice ride

322
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,760
And so when you're paying for something under your own pocket

323
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
And you want to be able to sleep a bit

324
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Or at least have some of the amenities

325
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Anyway, so he came out to me

326
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
He told me that and said, dude, that's great

327
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,760
But would you please send me some audio feedback

328
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,760
So that I can really share that with all of this

329
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I was just reinvented software

330
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
We met at the expo in Ontario last week

331
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,760
And spoke a little bit about Virgin Atlantic

332
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
It was my first time in a Virgin flight

333
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
And I thought I'd fly back before commenting

334
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
To see everything around the house

335
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
I thought I'd fly back before commenting

336
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
To see everything around the house

337
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,760
And lots of other airlines

338
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Other places, but I probably would have booked

339
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
A British Airways flight

340
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
To the expo this year

341
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
However

342
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
But at the same time

343
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
There were the gate gommies

344
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Strikes that crippled BA in the summer

345
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
And also around that time

346
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
You were raving about Virgin on your show

347
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
So I decided to take your recommendation

348
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
And check it out

349
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
First of all I would say

350
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
It was a really great price in the tickets

351
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,760
It was probably the most affordable direct flight

352
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,760
From Heathrow to San Francisco

353
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Where I needed to be before the expo

354
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Not enough for class unfortunately

355
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
But economy class

356
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
And it makes you wonder with margin so tight

357
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
How can you improve

358
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Well first of all I say there was great service at the airport

359
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Fast check in both that Heathrow and San Francisco

360
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
On the way back

361
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,760
Can Heathrow they have these DRI machines

362
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Where you can just pop in your ticket

363
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Choose a seat and drop your bag off

364
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
And in San Francisco they just weren't okay

365
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,760
I didn't end up in line for an hour waiting to check in

366
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Once you're on the plane

367
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
They have this accent, V-port

368
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Undimand and Taint system

369
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Which basically means you can choose what you want to see

370
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
When you want to see it

371
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,760
And it helps all our TV shows, movies, music

372
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
And enormous amount of stuff

373
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
So it helps you don't end up staring at the map

374
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
30 minutes to pass the time

375
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
And also Charlie and the chocolate factory begins

376
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Another thing was great food

377
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,760
It was much more imaginative than usual airline fare

378
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Never one of these will be for chicken thing

379
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Where they tell me that they're all at a beef

380
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
And what other airline gives you a hot vegetable

381
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Or ham panini as a snack

382
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
This is the most important thing

383
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,760
I think is that I thought there was extra leg room where I was

384
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
And they'd be a couple of inches

385
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
I haven't checked this out

386
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,760
But I really didn't feel that cramped on the flight

387
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,760
And that makes all the difference when you're stuck in capital class

388
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
All in all, I really recommend it

389
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
It was good food, great service

390
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Add an excellent price

391
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
I told you that

392
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
It was great to meet you at the expo

393
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
And I keep up the great work of the show

394
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
And I hope to see you again soon

395
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Take care

396
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
Thank you

397
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Something frightening just happened

398
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
I think I felt the building move

399
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
I swear to God

400
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,760
I wonder if there's like a little mini tremor or something

401
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
And I'm not imagining this

402
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
I really felt something move

403
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,760
And I have to say it kind of freaking out for a second there

404
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
It's one of those things

405
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
I never think about it

406
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,760
Okay

407
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
Wow

408
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
That seriously did kind of bum me

409
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
I for just a moment there

410
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
It got something

411
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,760
And I'm just trying to get through all the feedback that I think I need to share with you as soon as possible

412
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
I talked about

413
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Hooking up with Steve Webb

414
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,760
He's one of the Godcassers life spring podcast

415
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
And we had a conversation

416
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
On his podcast about

417
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,760
He had his son there and his lovely wife

418
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,760
And they also dropped by poolside

419
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Lots of people dropped by poolside

420
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Actually

421
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,760
So we talked about advertising in

422
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
In Godcass

423
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,760
And actually about there being

424
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,760
A rule that the Godcass network

425
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
will not carry advertising ever

426
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,760
And it was a really interesting discussion

427
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
And I really enjoyed it very much

428
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
And I appreciate all the work that Steve is doing

429
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,760
And I've told you before I love these Godcass

430
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
I've listened to all kinds of Godcass

431
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Because it's really short, inspirational, nice messages

432
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,760
And well produced most of them

433
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,760
So Craig Patchett, Patchett

434
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
who runs the Godcass network

435
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
Send me an email

436
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,760
And he heard, of course he heard the show

437
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
And he has some feedback

438
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
He has a response

439
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
So let's listen to that

440
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Because this is very interesting

441
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
You know

442
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
So I haven't listened to this myself

443
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,760
So who knows what we're going to hear

444
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Come on in

445
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Craig

446
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Hey Adam, this is Craig Patchett

447
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
From the Godcass network

448
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
And Godcass.org

449
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
He's got some pipes on him

450
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Kind of microphone you use him

451
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
And I like that sound

452
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
I've just finished listening to

453
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
I think with Delta Sierra Charlie

454
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
79er

455
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,760
And also listen to the interview that you did with Steve Webb

456
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,760
On the new life spring podcast

457
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Both of which talked about advertising in Godcass

458
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,760
And I wanted to clear up a couple of things

459
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
And talk about my decision

460
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Not to accept advertising on the Godcass network

461
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
First of all

462
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
The Godcass network does not accept

463
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Any kind of sponsorship

464
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Or advertising

465
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Not just ads in the podcast

466
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
There is no pledge drive

467
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,760
Something you mentioned in the daily source code

468
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
There are no PayPal buttons

469
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,760
There is absolutely nothing on the site

470
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Or within the podcasts that asked for money

471
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Or is in any way associated with that

472
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
And that was done quite specifically

473
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
When I started the Godcass network

474
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
And Steve alluded to that

475
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
In his interview with you

476
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,760
I wanted to make sure that the message that we portray

477
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,760
On the network basically was

478
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Not in any way

479
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Made questionable by

480
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Commercial content

481
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,760
And I think my best thing I could compare it to

482
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,760
It would be something like Jim and Tammy Fadebaker

483
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
And that whole debacle

484
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Or any of the other

485
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Ministries that are out there

486
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,760
In my mind

487
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
At least

488
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Time money into

489
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Some kind of game

490
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,760
They are basically selling you hope

491
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,760
And that's not what Christianity is about

492
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
That's not what Jesus is about

493
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
And it's certainly not what I want

494
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
The Godcass network to be about

495
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,760
I just don't want any kind of

496
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Connection with that at all

497
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
I want people to realize that

498
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
What's on the Godcass network

499
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
The message the shows

500
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
The information

501
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Is all there simply for

502
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
You know for one reason

503
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
And that is that because

504
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Each podcaster that has a show

505
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,760
On the network has a passion for the information

506
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
That they're putting out

507
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
And they want to share it with others

508
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
They want to break the stereotypes

509
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
And they want to give people an opportunity

510
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
To check out

511
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
You know what Christianity really is

512
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
And I may not be for everybody

513
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
But at least you know you can

514
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Explore it in an unadulterated format

515
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
And make up your own mind about it

516
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,760
So that's why the Godcass network is about

517
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,760
And that's why it does not

518
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
And will not carry advertising

519
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Or solicit money

520
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
In any way

521
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Now at the same time

522
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
I don't begrudge any of the

523
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Godcasters the desire

524
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,760
To be able to

525
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Create their podcasts full time

526
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
And you know I've told this to Steve

527
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,760
And I've told this to the others as well

528
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
And yes, if a

529
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Godcast

530
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Or if a show on the Godcass network

531
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
Does start carrying advertising

532
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Then you know it no longer qualifies

533
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
To be part of the Godcass network

534
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
But you know I would I would hope

535
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,760
That would be true for for some of the the Godcass

536
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
You know I would love to see Steve

537
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Be able to to Godcast full time

538
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
And be able to earn a living in it

539
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
I think he's very good

540
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,760
At what he does I think his show is excellent

541
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,760
And I think he deserves to be able to do it full time

542
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
If the Godcass network

543
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Conserves a vehicle to build traffic

544
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
For the shows that are on it to the point

545
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Where they are able to draw sponsors

546
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,760
And then you know I feel that I've been successful

547
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
With it in that respect

548
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,760
So it's not something that I discourage at all

549
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
I also have

550
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Some plans that are on the back burner

551
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
For expanding the network

552
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,760
That would possibly allow for

553
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Advertising the future for an offshoot of the network

554
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,760
I've also been talking with Alan Aguire

555
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
From the Zani Aguire's Drew Donkis's brother

556
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
About working with him

557
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,760
He currently runs a site called podcastmedia.net

558
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Which is well worth checking out that has some shows of its own

559
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,760
And so you know there are some plans on targeting Christian specifically

560
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Because as I mentioned I don't think that this is a problem

561
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,760
If you have integrity in the way that you approach it

562
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,760
And if you're addressing Christian specifically

563
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Okay

564
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
I got it

565
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
That's cool

566
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
If it's anyway we can help

567
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Let me know

568
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
He goes on for even a little bit longer

569
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,760
But I think the point was made so that's very cool

570
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Oh my goodness

571
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
I am so tired

572
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,760
I can't wait to get on to get on board

573
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
And go to sleep and just catch a couple hours

574
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
Oh wait a minute

575
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
There's a new lost episode too I guess

576
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
Yeah

577
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
Oh man I'm going to download that for my video iPod

578
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,760
That stuff is totally working for me

579
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Although dude when you run a video on the video iPod

580
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,760
I think you can probably watch

581
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,760
If you listen to a couple tunes or maybe one podcast

582
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
And you watch two episodes of loss

583
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
That's it for your battery

584
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
But still when you think about it that's

585
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
No, it's almost a

586
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Two hours probably

587
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
So this is in

588
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Just hop over the pod

589
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Say

590
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
The real content

591
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
It's chosen by the people

592
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
For the people

593
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,760
So you have no excuse

594
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,760
None of the time in your busy day to search

595
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
All the wonderful music at the pod

596
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Say music network

597
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Maybe I can help

598
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
By giving you the top rated music on the PMN

599
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Ready to play in one easy podcast

600
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,760
I may not have the sweet silky sensei

601
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Voice of that I'm curry

602
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
But it's all about the music after all

603
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Come listen in

604
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,760
At www.crushland.com

605
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,760
That's CRUSH L-A-N-D.com

606
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Thank you

607
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Ron and I did some really old school in the car today

608
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
While we were driving

609
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
I had the laptop open

610
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
And I was just playing a whole bunch of tunes

611
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
From the pod

612
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Say music network

613
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
We were really vibing on it

614
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
We were like, he's a musician

615
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
So we were just, oh wait a minute

616
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
That reminds me

617
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
I think big mic had this too

618
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Got a piece of

619
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
See if this is

620
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Shoot

621
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Let me see if I can find it

622
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Bloom was in a big mic's record store

623
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Let me read this to you first

624
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Before I lose this

625
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
I just bought this up on email

626
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
This is the power of pod

627
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Say music and podcast

628
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
And you'll love this

629
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Matt Volk says

630
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Adam I just bought the candy butcher's album

631
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Off iTunes

632
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
That's the song I want to do about Michael

633
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
But I played a couple times now

634
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
But on a whim

635
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
On a whim

636
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
I went and looked at sales rank on Amazon

637
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Yesterday it ranked 53,700 today

638
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Which is Wednesday

639
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,760
It is up to 8,258

640
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
He says

641
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,760
You don't quite have the slash dot effect yet

642
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,760
But your podcast is affecting record sales

643
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Uh-huh

644
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Say no more

645
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
I hear you

646
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,760
Okay, what was I gonna look for

647
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Oh yeah, that was the thing of

648
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Hold on

649
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
That's funny

650
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,760
I was thinking of detuning it

651
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Making it sound like shit

652
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
But I guess you just picked up a

653
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Yeah

654
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Let me see

655
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Where is he?

656
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
So this is very difficult

657
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
In Gmail I'm looking for Adam Bloom

658
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,760
And of course if you type

659
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Adam Bloom

660
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Then you get all kinds of email

661
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Let me run and vice versa

662
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Let me say that's out

663
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
This sucks

664
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
I'm sorry

665
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
I really apologize about this

666
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Disorganization

667
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Let me just try one more time

668
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Because it was really

669
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Pretty cool to listen to

670
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,760
I don't know

671
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
I want to put

672
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Jesus

673
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
I'm retarded

674
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Okay

675
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
This is the last

676
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
Last try here

677
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,760
I thought I had already downloaded that

678
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I gave it for the source code

679
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
But I guess I didn't

680
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Oh, here we go

681
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Got it

682
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Got it

683
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Got it

684
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
Okay

685
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
This is

686
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
I wish I knew the name of the record

687
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Storts in

688
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Right

689
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
It was at HATE

690
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
HATE and something

691
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
And this is a Ron Bloom

692
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Playing

693
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,760
In a record stuff

694
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:37,760
So I got one more piece of feedback from Angie B from Love Spirals

695
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Which by the way in the show notes

696
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Love Spirals

697
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,760
So I got one more piece of feedback from Angie B from Love Spirals

698
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Which by the way in the show notes

699
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Love Spirals

700
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
The spell was spelled as two separate words

701
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
But it's supposed to be one word

702
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Love Spirals

703
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
Check them out at LoveSpirals.com

704
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Angie B had a question about

705
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
And I guess Love Spirals

706
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,760
So I sold over 50,000 records

707
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,760
Complete in the pod save

708
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,760
Have music up on the pod save

709
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Music network

710
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
And

711
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,760
So she sent in a question

712
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Which I discussed on yesterday source code

713
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,760
And I guess she has a response back

714
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,760
So let's

715
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
Check that out

716
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Hold on

717
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Let me turn this off

718
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
There we go

719
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Now

720
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Hit me baby

721
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Come on

722
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Adam

723
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
It's Angie B of Love Spirals again

724
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Thanks for the compliment

725
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
You have a sexy voice too

726
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,760
So it keeps me coming back to listen

727
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Oh yeah, that lets her

728
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Lovely wife

729
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Don't worry about her

730
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,760
She hasn't listened to any shows this week Angie

731
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Is that why you keep coming back baby

732
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Is that really the reason

733
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Well you're welcome to do it

734
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
jealous now

735
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
Back to business

736
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Okay

737
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
It wasn't so much that I

738
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Expected to give me legal advice

739
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
Because I'm pretty well versed in these things

740
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
It's just the whole

741
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Cool factor that creative common seems to have

742
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,760
I mean I do listen to a number of music podcasts

743
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
And

744
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,760
People definitely seem to respect creative common artists

745
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,760
And a certain way

746
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
And

747
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Especially with all the BMI bashing that you've done lately

748
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
I'm just a little worried that podcasters

749
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Are going to be turned off to playing

750
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Love Spirals

751
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Because we do sign up our songs with BMI

752
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Get them copyrighted the old fashioned way

753
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
So

754
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
You know I just want to kind of bring that

755
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,760
That tier tension that some of us independent artists

756
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
That are a

757
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Kind of really need coffee

758
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,760
I still going to need to rely on some of the old school

759
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
Of course

760
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Business

761
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,260
Absolutely

762
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,260
Set ups for now

763
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,260
You know until something else happens

764
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,260
But I did want to thank you for including my audio feedback

765
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,260
And 280 because I got some emails from your listeners

766
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,260
And a few sales

767
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
So it's really great all the way around

768
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
And podsake music network

769
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,260
Podcasters be sure to check out Love Spirals on the site

770
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,260
Very cool

771
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Okay

772
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
No of course

773
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,260
I had this horrible thought that just flashed my mind

774
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
For a nanosecond

775
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
It would be horrible

776
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
If the music industry said

777
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
You can't even play

778
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
You can't play any music on a podcast

779
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,260
They had some kind of trick

780
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260
Paragraph somewhere

781
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,260
And something that was passed in the middle of the night

782
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
And that we couldn't play any music at all

783
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
And that music could be outlawed

784
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,260
It would be illegal unless it was from Warner or Sony

785
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Or EMI

786
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
My goodness

787
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,260
So let me just wind up with this bit now

788
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,260
About this Christmas song

789
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,260
Because I'd rather love call me

790
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,260
And you know he was just

791
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,260
You know he's been asked to participate on this Christmas song

792
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,260
So what the whole point was

793
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,260
Just I really wanted to try and experiment

794
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,260
And it's not so much about the Christmas song

795
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Other than going to be cool if we could actually produce something

796
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,260
And do it with a whole bunch of podsake music artists

797
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,260
And produce it over the wire if it were

798
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,260
So people doing their bits that are going to contribute

799
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,260
In their own home studios and then assembling it

800
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,260
And of course when you think about it

801
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,260
Maybe you should have gotten a lot of

802
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,260
Or maybe for a project like this

803
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,260
You might want to get a whole bunch of songwriters together

804
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
Because everyone has ideas

805
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,260
And of course you need to coin sea jones and a Michael Jackson

806
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,260
And people like that

807
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,260
But the idea here was just to have some fun

808
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,260
And see if we could do something as a group as a community

809
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
And it's starting to come together

810
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,260
And this is the song that I talked about

811
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,260
Slowed it, what if everyday could be Christmas

812
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
It's real sappy

813
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,260
It's real we are the worldish

814
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:58,260
But I must say those kinds of songs have super broad appeal

815
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,260
They really do

816
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,260
And I was just hoping that maybe maybe maybe maybe

817
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,260
This could kind of break out

818
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Maybe we would get some play on the radio

819
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,260
And it would bring more people into what's happening here in podcasting

820
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,260
And I believe the song is going to be registered

821
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,260
Or the proceeds will go to Unicef

822
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
You know what?

823
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,260
That happens to be a promo that I have

824
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,260
Right here, let's listen

825
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:38,260
Everybody, this is Slowed

826
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:43,260
Inviting everyone who's registered as an artist with the pod safe music network

827
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,260
To join in the chorus in an unprecedented recording project

828
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,260
To benefit the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF

829
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,260
If everyday work Christmas will feature pod safe artists from around the globe

830
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,260
We don't all have to be in the same room in order to sing together

831
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,260
The internet has changed the way music is produced and distributed

832
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:08,260
And now, pod casting will change the way a worldwide community can come together

833
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,260
To benefit a worthy cause during the holidays

834
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,260
This project will be a great ambassador to the world

835
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,260
For pod safe music and pod casting in general

836
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,260
So, if you're an artist member of the pod safe music network

837
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:28,260
Go to music.potshow.com and find out how you can help make this dream come true

838
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,260
And thank you Adam for getting this Christmas ball rolling

839
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,260
Yeah, let's have some fun!

840
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Cool!

841
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,260
Now, I wonder, of course, if there actually is something about this

842
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,260
Music.potshow.com, let me see

843
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,260
Okay, so much for the coordination, let me see

844
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,260
Didn't know

845
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,260
Okay, CC, if you're within the sound of my voice

846
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,260
We've got to get something up here

847
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,260
So, we've got to get a page up

848
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,260
Maybe I pop this promo too soon

849
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,260
If so, I apologize

850
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,260
All right, what do we do?

851
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,260
Let's just do a more kick and song

852
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,260
I want to do something really good to get out of here

853
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,260
So, we can, you know, one of those just almost

854
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Almost weekend songs

855
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,260
Let me see what do I have for you

856
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,260
Something that'll be really, really, really kick and

857
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,260
I'll be going to my iTunes all pod safe

858
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,260
Except for, I still have a lot of mashups in there

859
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,260
Which I'm removing one by one

860
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,260
I'm listening to them then I'm removing them

861
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,260
Which is really, really pretty sad

862
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:41,260
Dude, I don't know what to play

863
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,260
I don't know what to play

864
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,260
Dream of Thorpe, she's kind of cool

865
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,260
Just play one of her

866
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,260
I'm so far behind

867
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,260
Like I can play

868
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,260
If I find nothing seems to matter

869
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,260
I'll let you hear beside me

870
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,260
If I can play when you're with you

871
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,260
I'll feel like I'm all the cause

872
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,260
What am I?

873
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,260
Emotion to see you like

874
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,260
They could be paralyzed

875
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,260
And the light inside me

876
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:40,260
Feel so bright, it's home for me to do me

877
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,260
Like I can move my life

878
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,260
I've got nothing to do

879
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,260
I'll let you hear beside me

880
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:55,260
Like I can play when you're with you

881
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:02,260
I've got nothing to do

882
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,260
I'll let you hear beside me

883
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:10,260
If I can play when you're with you

884
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,260

Emotion to see you like my life

889
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,260
Emotion to see you like I'm all the cause

890
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,520
What am I?

891
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,260

It's so cool, man

908
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,260
You know where we really start out doing a lot of talk podcasts

909
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,260
Because early on we all agreed that we really shouldn't be playing license music

910
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,260
And even though we were kind of breaking the rules now and then we just decided to talk and it was really nice

911
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,260
And now I think we're flooding the ethernets

912
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,260
We're flooding it with beautiful music

913
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,260
Adrenal Thorpe fly fly fly

914
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,260
From the Podsame Music Network

915
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,260
You can find that at music.podshow.com

916
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,260
All that stuff we've been talking about

917
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,260
We're building it, okay

918
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,260
I'm so excited about this

919
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,260
And keep your feedback coming, keep your thoughts coming

920
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:05,260
We're going to make something incredibly beautiful happen

921
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,260
I'm convinced of it

922
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,260
Hey, I'll talk to you Friday from the cottage. Take care everybody

923
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,260
Bye-bye

924
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,260
Another podshow podcast

925
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,260
Stick it in your ear

926
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,260
Shoot

927
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,260
Oh man, how how the hell could I mess that up

928
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,260
You see for those of you who've been wondering

929
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,260
I make these shows 49 minutes exactly

930
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,260
And we do that because I air it on it airs on serious

931
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,260
Every single week afternoon

932
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,260
And I don't know

933
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,260
I thought it was coming up on 49 minutes

934
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,260
But it was 48 minutes

935
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,260
But actually I've been enjoying keeping myself to a time limit

936
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,260
Because it really helps me drive towards something

937
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,260
And make something happen

938
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,260
Pacific Coast Hellways next

939
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,260
If you're listening to this some serious otherwise I'll talk to you on Friday

940
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,260
As I said from the cottage, bye-bye
