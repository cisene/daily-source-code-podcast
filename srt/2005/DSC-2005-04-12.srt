00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Deadly source code, April 13th, 2005.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hey everybody, coming to you from the Waldorf Astoria.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's the Daily Source Code.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's right, this is Adam Curry.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In my hotel room in the big apple, it's officially still...

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wait a minute, did I mess it up? It's not the 13th.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I guess it's officially the 11th.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So let's just say this is for the 12th of April.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ah, well, you know, Jetlight.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's what Jetlight will do to you, I guess.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Coming to you from the Beta Cast Blaster.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Which means I'm on the headset right now.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm in my hotel room.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I am completely knackered in a good English way.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we would say, because Matt, the day started at...

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's see, I left the house at 7 a.m. Guilford time.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And right now it's about 5 a.m. in the UK.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's right, it's almost been 24 straight hours for me.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I feel pretty good actually.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Just got back from a lovely dinner in the basement here at the Waldorf Astoria.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's the infamous...

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What is it? Bare and beer or something like that?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A steak chop house where they basically hang dead cows up for 21 days to dry and cure

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and then they throw it on your table and somehow you eat that.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's pretty amazing actually.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, so it's been quite a journey.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
As I said, left the house, left the cottage at 7 a.m.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hopped on a brand new air carrier.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
At least for me it's a brand new air carrier.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Virgin Atlantic never traveled with them.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I actually, I think it was...

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Virgin Atlantic started...

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What did they start? Probably around...

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hmm, let me think, maybe around 10 years ago, right?

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I do remember one time.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, in fact, it was 1996 just before we took our company

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
think new ideas public and we did our European road show.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And we were booked to return back to New York on Virgin Atlantic.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But we showed up like 59 minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's pretty much the rule. Certainly in the UK, gate closes, gate closed.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You ain't getting on.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So I kind of... I think at that time we swore up and down

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and swore we'd never again fly Virgin Atlantic, which we'd never done.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But I gave it a new shot.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You know, what a little bit of set dressing and marketing.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You know, just making people feel good will do.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It goes quite a long way.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This really gave me the old feeling of flying back.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now I'm old enough.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And boy, am I feeling it now? I'm, you know, being 40.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I remember when we used to go traveling when I was a young boy.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I maybe five or six years old.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And my parents would dress me up in a nice little suit right in my sisters.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I would have a little cute little frocks on with the white gloves and the black shoes,

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
you know, the shiny black shoes.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because we were going flying.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And a lot of that old school, old world feeling kind of comes back to you

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
when you fly Virgin Atlantic.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They have the plush, red carpeting.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And the stewardesses have their hair up in buns, even the stewardes actually.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They continuously give you all kinds of snacks and drinks and make you feel right at home.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I didn't fly in there infamous upper class.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I just can't bring myself to pay that kind of money anymore to lay down.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If someone else paying for it, it'd be more than happy to, you know,

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
sometimes I will splurge like the last time when I went back from San Francisco.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That was on British Airways, but I got something they call the premium economy,

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
which gives you a lot of flexibility.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can change your flights, you know, if you want to.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And you get enough leg rooms that I can actually with six foot four.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can actually sit down and, you know, and almost kind of sleep comfortably.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Everything was perfect except for one thing.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They have this video on demand service on board.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They have 50 movies.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can compile your own playlists.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it's, I guess it's a streaming type of service.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And they started off the flight by saying, if you're, you know,

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
if you're, if you're in flight entertainment system,

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
should become garbled or confused.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Just let one of the flight attendants know.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We'll reset your entertainment system.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It will take you 20 minutes before you can watch again.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But at least then you can watch.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So it was something like that.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're some vague announcement I was like, wow, that doesn't sound very good.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So first of all, I had seat 19D.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And for some reason, I sat down in 19C and I was already pretty much established.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It already made acquaintance with, with the guy sitting next to me.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I was like to have an aisle seat.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then some other passenger came up and who, of course, had 19D.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, 19C and, I said, well, you know, he said, I don't worry about it.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're sitting there. I'll just sit on this side.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's also an aisle seat. No problem.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, I wish I had, had gotten my original seat because, of course,

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
my in flight entertainment system fucked up.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And the reason why, because here it was,

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was completely jazzed because I could watch the aviator,

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
a movie that I've been wanting to watch for a long time.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Big fan of what Howard Hughes has done in aviation.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I was about an hour into it and my guy next to me, my seatmate,

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
needed to go to the restroom.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So, of course, that means that me being in the aisle,

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have to get out stand up.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And when I sat back down, I sat down on the controller

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and then the movie started to rewind and I fast forward it.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And then, yep, it started to hose out, which means,

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I guess it's streaming.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They must have some kind of streaming server on board.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And it got all, you know, you got all the digital blocking

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and the static and it was unwatchable.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, I rang my call button and they said, oh, yeah,

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it's time for you to be reset, sir.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's like something they clearly have done more than once.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And check this out.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, I actually heard this on the announcement.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
When we reset it, you'll see a penguin followed by computer code.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I knew it was coming because they reset it

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and lo and behold, Linux, right?

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Linux is running this thing.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I wasn't fast enough.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I grabbed my, you know, try to get my camera,

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
but before I knew what the boot screen had already passed by,

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
it had like, what was the command that it starts up air seat

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
or something like that?

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Needless to say, it never really worked again.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I had them reset it again.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It was a total of like an hour of waiting for this thing to reboot.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And it just, it didn't come back.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And everyone else's entertainment system was working fine.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So, when I go back on Saturday,

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I hope to catch the second half or the second two-thirds,

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the remaining two-thirds of the aviator.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So, that was a major bummer, of course.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I did have a chance to catch up on a whole bunch of podcasts.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I want to make a special mention of Michael Butler,

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
a general geek show.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He did a sound seeing tour of a strip joint in San Francisco,

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
which was just phenomenal.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It was really funny, Mike.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I really enjoyed that one.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm on the headset, by the way.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm using the cast blaster.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is up to beta number five.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
After this week, when I get back,

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we'll be opening up a small beta amongst,

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think we're going to go for no more than 15 or 20 people.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I'm going to be selecting a few.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Mike, the developer, I'm working with.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We'll be selecting a few.

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So, we can really, you know, just flesh out some stuff before,

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
before we take this prime time, or at least prime time beta.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So, if the sound is not exactly what you are used to hearing,

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
it's because I'm on the outtick, lancing headset.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because it is, you know, almost midnight,

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and feel like setting up the wireless microphone and all that.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And that's what's kind of cool about the cast blaster.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You can just, you know, it already has all of my,

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the openers and my jingles, and of course, my important effects.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Like like that is already, it's already pre-loaded.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And all I have to do is just put in the stuff that I want to play

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
on the particular show.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So, I'm in my hotel room here at the Waldorf Astoria,

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
which is owned by the Hilton family.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
In fact, I think Paris has a full-time residence here

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
with her family, although she may not be here all the time.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll be out in California.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Although today was a beautiful day in New York.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We got in to the, I'd never been to the new terminal for,

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
or ever, you know, it's been new, I guess, for the past three years,

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
three years ago when they reopened it.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Sun was shining, it was, you know, 75 degrees.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It was just, there was no traffic on the road.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It was absolutely wonderful.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The city, everyone was having lunch outside by the time I got in.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I couldn't check into the room, of course.

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Check out time is 12.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Check in time is 3 p.m.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was in the hotel around 115.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So, of course, I dropped my bag off.

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Went out down the corner and immediately got me a big,

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
a jumbo, a hot dog with sour crowd, and catch up,

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and mustard, and a snap-alice tea, and sat down

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
in the steps of, what's the building that's next door here?

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, everyone was sitting on the steps,

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and just enjoying the sunshine,

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and then had another wonderful digital experience.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I bought a tea mobile SIM card for my cell phone,

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
slipped that in, which gives me, you know,

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
one, seven, six, eight, number, whatever the heck it is.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Called the 203 number, which is our Skype in,

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and talked to Patricia, who was sitting at home in the cottage

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
for, you know, about, you know, a penny and a half per minute.

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I love it when that works.

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's just so phenomenal.

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Ron had already arrived in an already done one meeting,

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and we had two meetings that we're going to do

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
before the day was over just to get him in and while, you know,

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
while we have that afternoon.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So, it really didn't get back to the hotel,

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
until about seven o'clock,

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and I was still in my flight clothes, you know,

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
so I was pretty rancid by that time.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But this is such a wonderful feeling

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to be in a New York hotel room,

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
because it's all the sounds and the smells,

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you know, the, in fact, you can probably hear it.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm actually going to disconnect the power supply here,

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
so we can walk around the room for a second.

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know, you've got the heater slash air conditioner,

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
which is always on and makes a lot of noise.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
In fact, is it on right now?

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let me, there you go.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Put my microphone down.

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Near the air conditioning unit,

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can actually open up the window if you're interested.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm on a second just to hear some street noises.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ah.

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, I can hear,

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
so it's pretty quiet outside, of course,

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
it's almost midnight.

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I hear my phone is,

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it's my phone about to ring here.

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know if you can hear that disturbance.

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll put the phone down over here.

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They don't have Wi-Fi in the hotel.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They do.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's kind of cold, actually.

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It did get cold outside.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They don't have Wi-Fi.

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They do have broadband.

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And it's, it's a wired broadband.

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Kind of like a little Cisco router sitting here.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So I brought the Mac and the tablet.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So I'm using the Mac as,

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
basically as a Wi-Fi base station.

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So that's connected to the broadband.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I'm roaming on the, on the tablet PC.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Nice and a roomy.

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You know, it's just, it's an old fashion.

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's a great hotel.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, it's, it's one of those New York hotels.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You just recognize anywhere.

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Once you've, once you've been in it.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So I'm sitting on one of the two double beds.

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We connect my power supply there.

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm almost out of breath.

251
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Did some email.

252
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Man, a lot of, a lot of email about these, these English disjockeys.

253
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Almost like, let me pull that up for a second.

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let me see if I can find these jibbrownies.

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There's a new site that came online called podshows.com.

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm going to go to it right now.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Probably, by the way, the, the broadband isn't the best in the world.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sometimes it's just no connectivity at all.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So hopefully I can even get this show uploaded properly.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So these, these English DJs have started a, like a, I guess a pod cast thing.

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Here, it'll probably start playing here in a second.

262
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Radio where you want it when you want it.

263
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Hello, you just found podshows.com.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
A little taste of the teacher.

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is the world's first professional podcast.

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's the only place you can find.

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So it says,

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Sounds like crap.

269
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So I'm not quite sure what to make of this.

270
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They're charging for these shows, which include shows by Tony Blackburn,

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
who was about a hundred years old.

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And, I mean, it doesn't really matter what they're doing.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's, it's a little disturbing that they're basically taking something that,

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
you know, we have podshow.com and now podshows.com.

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
They, they really think that that's going to fly.

276
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And immediately, people have jumped into help.

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Podcast Paul has, who is a lawyer has given me some advice.

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And now we're going to see if we should do anything about it and what we'll do about it.

279
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But just makes no sense to me.

280
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And also that the, what they're trying to do there, it's not really,

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
doesn't, just isn't really fitting with the vibe of podcasting if you ask me.

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You know, so anyway, check it out podshows.com.

283
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You can see Tony Blackburn's horrible rug.

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What else was going on?

285
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, I listened to Don and Drew.

286
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Their latest show on the, on the, on the plane right over.

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They've got a new sponsor, directs, condoms and lube.

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It was, it was a great show.

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Listening to, to Don command Drew to lube up.

290
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was definitely a trip.

291
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let me see.

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I've got some promos for you today.

293
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And also I selected a mashup, which was suggested by the one and only pim daddy.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's a combination of now that we found love.

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And I guess it's Shannon.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's called now that we found music.

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Check that out for a couple of minutes.

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll be back with you with some new pod save music and a hit test on today's daily source code.

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I thought it was clear the plan was we were sharing this feeling.

300
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Everything went out the house.

301
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But when the music changes, the plan has been arranged.

302
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You went to pieces on it.

303
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We started dancing and love, but I seemed to love bro.

304
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But now it's just somebody to do.

305
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're like I've got one more thing to do.

306
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm going to do it.

307
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You don't get away.

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Just get away.

309
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You don't get away.

310
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You don't get away.

311
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You don't get away.

312
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Just get away.

313
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You don't get away.

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You don't get away.

315
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He tried reading, they not necessarily just that there's what I see.

316
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
His dancing is way back to me.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's not just getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold,

318
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:27,000
it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's not getting cold, it's

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You'll get away, just get away

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You'll get away, just get away

321
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You'll get away, just get away

322
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You'll get away, just get away

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You'll get away, you'll get away

324
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You'll get away, you'll get away

325
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You'll get away, you'll get away

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You'll get away, you'll get away

327
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You'll get away, you'll get away

328
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You'll get away, you'll get away

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Just be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool,

330
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Nice mashup of third world now that we found love and Shannon let the music play on your daily source code for the 12th of April 2005, thanks to Pimp Daddy Sid for pointing that one out to us all.

331
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's just watching TV, saw George Bush an aerial sharon at the ranch and Crawford Texas Man, aerial sharon is fucking huge.

332
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I always thought he was wearing a bulletproof vest that that's why his jacket was so big but the man is just big, he's like a fucking Humpty Dumpty unbelievable.

333
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I didn't even catch the story, now I've got Joan Rivers yapping about being a guest at the Royal Wedding, I caught that actually, the Wedding Prince Charles married to Camilla Parker Bowles.

334
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I got a bad feeling about that, I really do, that just, you know, he was seeing her while he was actually, I guess they've always been in love and I'm not quite sure why he ever married Diana.

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He certainly didn't do her justice man, I mean, this thing just has, it does me a real bad taste and I think most of the, most of the British public kind of agrees, you know, they like, whatever.

336
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
They certainly will never, we'll probably won't address her as the Princess of Wales, although that is her her official title and by the way, what is the deal with her and all of her hats?

337
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Why didn't you know, can't they pin that shit down to her head? Why does she always have to hold on to it with that trembling left hand, you know, it's like, either you wear the hat and have it bolted down so it sits right or you know, don't wear it, it's just anyway.

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, I got some great promos, check this one out, this is a great podcast.

339
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
She was blonde, she was beautiful. More than 40 years after her death, she is arguably more popular today than during her own lifetime.

340
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
She is the one and only Marilyn Monroe. My name is Melinda Mason and I've been a Marilyn fan and collector for over 15 years.

341
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Join me for my bi-weekly podcast, my Marilyn, celebrating the life of this amazing actress. I'll be discussing her life, current news, collectibles, basically everything, Marilyn.

342
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So, check it out at Marilyn Monroe.ca slash podcast.

343
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I got to tell you, I'm a sucker for sounds and music from the 30s and the 40s and the 50s.

344
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
There's another podcast that I'm a big fan of that I've been subscribed to ever since I first found out about it.

345
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
PW Fenton does digital flotsom at digitalflotsom.org.

346
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I've talked to PW a couple of times over the past, well, in the lifespan of podcasting.

347
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And inevitably, married guys eventually talk about their wives.

348
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And I was pretty surprised and was gaffering and chuckling out loud on the play.

349
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,000
When I heard the following opening to the most recent digital flotsom podcasts.

350
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Okay, this is not a normal. If there is such a thing, digital platform.

351
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Every time I do a show, the wife says, oh, that was nice. You should talk more.

352
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You're so good at that. I love when you talk. Why don't you talk?

353
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, about a week ago, Adam Curry, the pod father.

354
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh, wait.

355
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It says to me, hold on a second.

356
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
When you say the pod father got a little boy in a unrelated context, you should listen to your wife.

357
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They're always right.

358
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So you're all in for it. For this week, it's the wife's edition.

359
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Lots of me talking. Longer show, maybe. Lots of wife stuff.

360
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So you really should check out the most recent digital flotsom.

361
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's the wife episode. It's got great bits in there by famous comedians.

362
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Some wonderful songs.

363
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And PW also talks a lot about the quote production values.

364
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
How he does this podcast.

365
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And how content really is king.

366
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And that it's not about the sound quality.

367
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's about the decisions you make when you go to create your podcast.

368
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And there's some really, some real good nuggets of information in there that I definitely suggest you check out.

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
There's a beautiful sound seeing tour called On the Wing.

370
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Thanks, Adam.

371
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Now we're more than a sound seeing tour. On the wing is the podcast magazine of birds and birding.

372
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We'll cover the people, places, and creatures that make birding one of the fastest growing hobbies in the world.

373
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Everybody's after looking at how he's trying to get out of dodge.

374
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Oh, look at that.

375
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You got the idea, right?

376
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's really intimate.

377
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's left and right.

378
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And it really trips with your brain when you're listening to that on the, uh, your buds.

379
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The April edition of On the Wing is available at on the wing.lipsin.com.

380
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That's on the wing dot libsyn.com.

381
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Those lipsing guys are doing okay.

382
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It seems to be a pretty simple service that's working quite well.

383
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And people are very happy with it.

384
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And in the past, I've mistakenly said, I've mistakenly talked about their pricing.

385
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But it really is not based on bandwidth, but it's based on storage.

386
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And it's got a very interesting model.

387
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't know if they're making any money on it, but I do see a lot of podcasts coming through the directory.

388
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
By the way, the directory, we're now up to over 4,800 podcasts actively tracked.

389
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
A couple new categories have come online as well, which include what we have bicycles.

390
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Also, Madge Weinstein is not doing the gain lesbian node.

391
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There's a category there of podcasts.

392
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Just all kinds of stuff happening.

393
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And of course, you may be wondering what I'm doing in New York here to meet up with a couple of,

394
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
the pod show technical partners that we've entered into agreements with.

395
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We are closing a couple of big advertising deals, which are very excited about.

396
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And it looks like the first week of May is when we're really going to start unveiling a lot of the talent that we've made investments in.

397
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Excuse me.

398
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
As Madge would say, I'm so bloated.

399
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I just got to tell you a little story, a little sidebar here.

401
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You know, Madge Weinstein's got usually has a theme song.

402
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And people just keep sending her fantastic new self-written theme songs.

403
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It really hits home about how cool all this podcasting is.

404
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The interaction you can have with your listeners.

405
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And we were at the dinner table Patricia Christina and I.

406
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And I was mentioning some of the songs and Christina loves it.

407
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
She loves talking about being bloated and yeast.

408
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Hey, she's a 14. I'm sorry. She's 14.7. She would point out to you.

409
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And we came up with a couple of songs.

410
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And we were actually going to record one of these Patricia's sister Ivana's coming over in two weeks time.

411
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And together, well, if you had heard any of the stars on 45 stuff for the star sister stuff that Patricia Ivana've done together,

412
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
their voices fits so beautifully. They do great harmonies.

413
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I think we're going to record if you're bloated and you know what clap your hands.

414
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We also came up with what was the other one.

415
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Do you remember the the floaters bloated on?

416
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And there was a Christina came up with a fabulous.

417
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, was that pilot?

418
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, oh, oh, she's bloated.

419
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You're listening to yeast radio.

420
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You can tell who's the singer in the curry family and you can definitely tell who isn't the singer.

421
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So anyway, doing some some meetings and I hopefully I'll be flying back Saturday back to the UK just in time to do some more intense flight training.

422
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I spoke to the wing commander and we're going to try and combine a couple things next week.

423
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
When I was in Iraq last February.

424
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So that was February at 2004 with the Dutch Marines.

425
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We did live broadcast with there for 10 days.

426
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
If you just look at him curry and Iraq on on Google.

427
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
If you Google that, you'll see all kinds of pictures and stuff from when we were there.

428
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It was just a life altering experience.

429
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We did is I left my transmitter.

430
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I do have a transmitter 100 watt FM transmitter.

431
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Left that there for the troops with a satellite dish.

432
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So they could listen to radio from back home.

433
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And since the Dutch Marines have now left Camp Smitty in Iraq.

434
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
They are no longer in the coalition there, which was all planned and agreed to upfront.

435
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
They want to give me, I think they want to give me the transmitter back.

436
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
They do that next Wednesday.

437
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It was at Wednesday the 20th or whatever.

438
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And I think they're going to give it to me in then five seconds later.

439
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
They're going to take it back because they basically like the idea so much.

440
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Now they want to take the transmitter to Afghanistan.

441
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So I wouldn't mind visiting them over there and actually doing some podcast.

442
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That would be very cool.

443
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I haven't spoken to them about it.

444
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But maybe I can convince somebody.

445
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
He's back everybody.

446
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's y'all.

447
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Hi Adam.

448
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
There you go.

449
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
A lot is going on.

450
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Not only here with me, but you're also on the road.

451
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I'll try to create a hit test if possible.

452
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But I think it won't be as frequent as we are used to.

453
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That's okay.

454
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But my information about what's going to happen is to be found in my own hit test podcast.

455
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And you can find it at yompolet.nl.j and p-o-l-e-t.nl.

456
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
For now, there is one.

457
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So let's start right away.

458
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Rock on.

459
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Whoa.

460
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh, yon.

461
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Come on, that way.

462
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm just going to use the rewind feature here.

463
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I have no idea what that is, yon.

464
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You may do them in frequently, but they're not easier.

465
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
This is number two.

466
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's a bit longer.

467
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's, I know what that is.

468
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's, uh, Donald Fagan.

469
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
With, uh, that international geophysical year was the album title.

470
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Bob Bada.

471
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I think it must be steely Dan or Donald Fagan.

472
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Some combination there.

473
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And the final one.

474
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Number three.

475
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Let's talk, talk.

476
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But, uh, let me listen.

477
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's my life.

478
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I think so.

479
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And it's time for the answers.

480
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And this is number one.

481
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's Phil Ferran and Galaxie.

482
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
This is Dan's in tight.

483
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, man.

484
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I should have known that one.

485
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Great early 80s, too.

486
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That's in tight.

487
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Bill Ferran.

488
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Man, that's an old, uh, decibel radio, too.

489
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
My prior radio days, an answer to that.

490
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And so number one in today's hitest is dancing tight.

491
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Phil Ferran and Galaxie.

492
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
This is, uh, a bit of a complicated title.

493
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Um, the title of this song is called.

494
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I do why.

495
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, I got it right.

496
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
International geophysical year.

497
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah.

498
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But it's also well known by, uh, not a title.

499
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And it's a wonderful world.

500
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This is Donald Fagan in the hitest.

501
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And so number two.

502
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Great song.

503
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I do what I thought.

504
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Well, this is worth it.

505
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah.

506
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Donald Fagan in the number two.

507
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And this is talk talk.

508
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Always nice to have them in the hitest.

509
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Great.

510
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
This is, it's my life.

511
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And so number three.

512
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
All right.

513
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
See what a three today.

514
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Man, whatever happened to those guys.

515
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's my life.

516
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Talk talk.

517
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Well, that's it for today's hitest.

518
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Adam.

519
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think you had a, uh, three out of three today.

520
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No.

521
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
At least I hope so.

522
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Two out of three.

523
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Um, again, I don't know what's going to happen in the coming weeks and months.

524
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We just have to wait and see.

525
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
One thing it is, uh, certain almost is that, um, uh,

526
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the high prediction values of the hitest is going to drop a bit.

527
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Because I will have to be, uh,

528
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
recording the hitest with a noble kind of simple headset.

529
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And not with all the external gear.

530
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm using here right now.

531
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And, uh, let's, that is a shame.

532
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And, uh, I'll be okay.

533
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Maybe I'll try to record it in another way, uh,

534
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
to, um, maybe I will, um, prepare the hitest, uh,

535
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
doing the week and record them all in the weekends.

536
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But I'm, I don't know if I've time for that.

537
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And I, I think that, um, my wife is not going to be happy with it.

538
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Um, listen to the digital plots of podcasts.

539
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Like I said, we have to wait and see.

540
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
More information about what's going on with my life and with, uh,

541
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
the problems I'm having right now is, so to be found in my own hitest podcast.

542
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Uh, www.yumpolet.nl, this J&POLAT.nl.

543
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Feedback is welcome with hitest at gmail.com.

544
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And I hope to see you soon, Adam.

545
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Till next time, bye-bye.

546
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
All right, young, and please take it easy, buddy.

547
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Don't worry about it.

548
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
If you can't create it, it's not a problem at all.

549
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And I will be sending you off a, uh, cast blaster, um,

550
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
beta in time so that you can, uh,

551
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
uh, create, uh, the hitest.

552
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
If you feel that you, if you feel up to it, um,

553
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
um, and you'll be able to do that, uh,

554
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
in kind of the same hokey way.

555
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm doing it right now.

556
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But it does seem to work.

557
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Even though, um, you know, this,

558
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and I'm promising myself.

559
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm going to pick up a better headset,

560
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
because not only is this microphone, you know,

561
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
so, so it's not, you know, not the best mic in the world.

562
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Uh, but the headphones are just really booming.

563
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's, uh, actually when the hitest has played,

564
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I had to remove one, um, uh, one side of the headphones,

565
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
just to, you know, get rid of the boomingness, man.

566
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's just, oh, these,

567
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
altic lancings, not at all what I want.

568
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So we're 35 minutes into the show.

569
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I want to play one more song for you.

570
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And this, um, is, uh, a piece of podsafe music.

571
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Um, and I just want to read you, um,

572
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
this, uh, this email that came in.

573
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I was really pleased to see this.

574
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Uh, shoot. Now, of course,

575
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
the connectivity here really freaking bites.

576
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't know if it's the DNS lookup,

577
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
or if it's, uh,

578
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
or if it's just purely the connectivity,

579
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
or what it is, but,

580
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
oh, on the second.

581
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's loading.

582
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Uh, see, that's what you get when you do show notes in, uh,

583
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
with your Gmail account. Oh, here it is.

584
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay.

585
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So I got, uh,

586
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
where is it?

587
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Here it is.

588
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
AWS.

589
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay.

590
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Hi, Adam.

591
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Says Alan Wence.

592
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Does that ring a bell?

593
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Alan Wence, anybody?

594
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
No.

595
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
A quick, very condensed bio for reference.

596
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I was the original bassist in Wild Cherry.

597
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Of course, we know Wild Cherry from

598
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Bob Bom, Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom.

599
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Play that funky music.

600
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Uh,

601
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I am now running an independent label production and publishing company,

602
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
our newest release,

603
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
out of warranty is both accessible,

604
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
original and we recently placed two tracks in Maryland,

605
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Mansons,

606
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
a, in Maryland, in Maryland's,

607
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Man in Maryland.

608
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm butchering this.

609
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We recently placed two tracks in Maryland,

610
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
men's a Monroe bio pick,

611
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and he wanted to know if I was interested in playing

612
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,600
didn't play something on the daily source code and I said yeah absolutely please send

613
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:07,840
it on first of all I said dude I have played a while cherry on so many radio shows

614
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,320
it's just it's great to hear from it because I think you know with that particular song

615
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,840
it is it is kind of that bass that you know really is the music cue of you know that's

616
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:25,040
the musical molecule of that song and it really really kicks it and what he sent me and I have

617
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:34,240
to look that up hold on a second totally not organized here the title of the track is

618
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:48,240
shoot oh how come I can't here it is is this it is it just titled Catherine I think it's just

619
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,680
titled Catherine isn't it I just want to double check I don't I don't want to get it wrong

620
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:00,880
this yeah I think it is just titled Catherine anyway it's it don't expect wild cherry at all

621
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,680
this is something completely different but it has a I don't know a nice vibe to it

622
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,480
so I wanted to share that with you

623
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:32,960

628
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,880
I'm of course, I'll put that in the show notes, which may be a bit abbreviated for

629
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,080
tonight, because it's, I'm so wrecked, it's almost been 24 hours that I've been up

630
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,080
and running around. And we're at 40 minutes, which means it's perfect time to end the show

631
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:02,880
for today, of course, tomorrow be back with another source code from the Big Apple.

632
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,480
As always, comments are welcome at a Maccurry.com. I may not respond immediately because, well,

633
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,080
I'm not sitting in my office at the Cottage all day, and just don't have the time to sit

634
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:19,080
through my Gmail account. Of course, the podcast feed is at dailysourcecode.com.

635
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:28,080
We can also find archives in the most recent show. So, looking forward to enjoying a

636
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:34,080
little bit of American culture. It's been a while since I've really had a chance to roam

637
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:40,080
the streets of New York, so maybe maybe maybe maybe a little bit of sound seeing.

638
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Maybe some sound seeing of Denver, who knows, and would be all over the place. So, thank

639
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:52,080
you very much for bearing with me, and thanks for subscribing to the Daily Source Code.

640
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,080
Be sure to check it tomorrow. Take care, everybody. Bye-bye.
