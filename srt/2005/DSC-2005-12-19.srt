1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
POT show.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We bring good podcasts to life.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta share a Charlie.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
3-0-1.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Come to daddy.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're my think.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But we're not ready yet.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're my think.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But we should get a pet.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're my think.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But don't think.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's have a baby.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm my think.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My hair's a little grey.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm my think.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll beat you all to play.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're a pink.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're my think.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's have a baby.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh baby.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh baby.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh baby.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh baby.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The city closed at me on max.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A million.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Children in a baby's sack.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The city closed at me on max.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
A million.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Children in a baby.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh baby.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh baby.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh baby.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My say.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We just don't have the space they might say.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The city closed at me on max.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A million.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Children in a baby's sack.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The city closed at me on max.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A million.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Children in a baby's sack.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The city closed at me on max.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
A million.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Children in a baby.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Children in a baby's sack.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Children in a baby's sack.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,640
So, candy butchers, let's have a baby!

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,520
Found that on the podcast, I'm using Network brand new, of course we know from what to do with

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,360
Michael Cooltune, from the Hang-On Mike CD.

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Hey everybody, how you doing?

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,120
It's Monday and we're getting closer to Christmas and I'm back in the cottage.

51
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,040
Good to be back home, let me tell you, the flight wasn't all that great.

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,960
Of course it was once again my favorite airline virgin, upper class, get my little

53
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,280
bed, sweeten everything but, man, it was, we sat on the tarmac for about an hour and a half,

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,320
it was completely reigned and fogged in and everything was slow so it took a while to get

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,720
off the ground and then it was just like, I don't know man, I don't know what they fed

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,520
everybody in the lounge but it's stank, people just smelling up the whole cabin and it's so

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,200
hard to sleep if it seems like someone in 49F, if they fart, it wops all the way up to

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,320
8k but of course it could also have been the person in 7k.

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,120
It doesn't matter, it's just, oh man, laying down there trying to get the some sleep and

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:56,040
then, just, oh, this is whafting, now damn, so, not a lot of sleep, add to that, just

61
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,440
before I left Patricia and I had spoken on the phone and she told me what she was going

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,560
to do to me when I got home so that of course made me rather restless, thinking about it.

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,680
Don't worry, I totally collected.

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,400
So anyway, Patricia and Christina have decorated the cottage, look great when I got home

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,240
yesterday and all the, we got a tree in the back which I'd gotten just before we left and

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,840
that's got all the lights and there's lighting inside the house and there's reaths and

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,160
there's everything, it's just a complete perfect Christmas atmosphere, just I'm so ready

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
for it.

69
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,800
And of course the weather cooperated completely, really clear day, blue skies about one degree

70
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,680
below freezing so just, you know, perfect and I haven't been to the high street yet,

71
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,000
which is where, you know, it's the shopping high street, every town in the UK has a

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,840
high street and that's where all the shop starts what they call it, and our high street

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,840
is very, very picturesque, you know, with carolers and it's a traditional English

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Christmas.

75
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,040
So maybe I should do a sound sing to it and maybe, maybe tomorrow or Thursday, Patricia

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,920
now do a quick sound sing, not a full show, which is a quick sound sing tour of the

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,240
high street in Gilford.

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:15,640
So let me see, I think I've finally have to give up completely on the Yamaha 16A W

79
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,480
workstation, 16, was an AW 16G.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,160
I don't know what the hell is wrong with it, but even if the face is off or it's just,

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,120
you have to configure everything internally with the onboard, you know, this little display,

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,360
which is, looks like it's made by Ford actually, you know, crappy little green yellow

83
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,880
display and it's hard, you know, it's, it's hard to troubleshoot it because one parameter

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,400
can be off and it's not as easy as just looking at cables and following them along.

85
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,360
So I put the sound craft back in and although I don't have the, the pre-processor on, on the

86
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,760
microphone, I'm just running everything through the stereo valve, here my voice is starting

87
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,800
to go, running everything through the stereo valve processor.

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,640
So maybe later on, I'll figure out if I can put the other preamp in and I just, I think

89
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,920
I'm getting up on the on the 16A W. It's time for just a good old fashioned analog board.

90
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,920
I don't know about these digital ones, man, that just don't do it for me. I like to follow

91
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,560
the wires so I can think about how stuff's being inserted and where it's going to, and

92
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,160
actually I think it kind of sounds better, although I don't have the reverb on now, so you'll

93
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,240
have to kind of pretend that it's in there. Oh, what else? So Christina has two more days of

94
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
school, took her to school early this morning, no traffic, beautiful, great to be back in the

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,480
jag, I have to say, as much as I love Trinity, the jag definitely has some benefits to it,

96
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:42,400
seat warmers, perfect, 400 brake horsepower under my right foot. Yeah, it makes me feel manly.

97
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,560
So today, I think we go through a couple of a couple of G-mails, of course we have our

98
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
biodesal segment, which now I've completely produced, well, I'm not going to tell you all about it.

99
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,640
It's coming up. Let me see, we were talking first about Gmail, Gabrielle, I was talking about

100
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,040
wanting Gmail on my blackberry, and so I got a whole bunch of similar emails as Gabrielle sent me.

101
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,080
A green that the labels are crucial to the Gmail experience, so there's this, you know,

102
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,400
there's this Gmail client that you can use on your blackberry, but it's still, it's basically,

103
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,040
here's the thing, all these Gmail clients, it doesn't matter what it is, it's the push email

104
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,560
that makes the blackberry so interesting. The meaning you have to, you know, wait for more than a second

105
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,520
for something to be retrieved from the network, it's just too slow, it takes too long, and it's

106
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,600
not that the network is slow, it's just the machine has to build up a screen again, so maybe the

107
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,800
new blackberries will be faster. But, you know, the idea of push email where, you know, you just

108
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,240
click on the email tab, and there's the email already sitting there, you know, I didn't have to

109
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,600
ask for it, and have to retrieve it, that is such a benefit. I just like it, you know, the blackberry

110
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,440
can synchronize, I think, what does it do in exchange server? So when it makes sense, can't we,

111
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,400
maybe that's an open protocol, or there must be some kind of protocol that we can, look,

112
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,200
blackberry isn't a Microsoft product, so clearly they know how to communicate with the exchange

113
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,600
protocol. If we can then have your blackberry communicate with Gmail the same way it does with your

114
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:19,440
exchange server, oh, man, then you have an unbeatable combination, unbeatable. Imagine setting up filters

115
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,760
in your Gmail, you know, send this off to my blackberry, don't send this off, and then the reconciliation,

116
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,960
when you delete something, or label something on the blackberry, then it would be labeled in Gmail.

117
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,080
That's what I was looking for. There's all kinds of workarounds and hacks, but I'm looking

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,240
for like a full-blown solution, and it seems to me that all that's needed really is, you know,

119
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,560
hey, what's that? Yeah, we're going to fly tomorrow, someone going by, want to see my mom

120
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,960
in Holland, so we're flying early, or not tomorrow. I'm sorry, Wednesday, we're flying early

121
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,760
from Echo Golf, Tango Fox Trot, to Echo Hotel, Romeo Delta, throughout her day. They were

122
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,960
going to get in the cab, drive off to my mom's place, we'll hang out for a while. We'll probably

123
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,480
have to leave around three o'clock, I want to make it back, while they're still light.

124
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,280
You know, that was funny last night. I must have been a re, I don't know if it was a repeat or not,

125
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,880
but top gear, which is by far. Actually, it won't in the ward, what do we, in any ward, I think.

126
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,320
Top gear is the best automobile program, best written automobile program. I don't think a single

127
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
part of it is written, but they do these great, beautiful montages and little, you know,

128
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,800
little mini documentaries that they're testing cars out. They really do a great job. It looks

129
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,200
like it's shot on film. It's just beautiful, lots of in-car camera stuff, lots of

130
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,360
drive-by shots. It's just, it's very well done. You can Google top gear on Google video and

131
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,360
there's some of it in there. So, yesterday they raised a front, was it from Northern Italy to London.

132
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,400
They raised a Bugatti. And this is the Bugatti that has 1,000 brake horsepower and has like

133
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,240
eight cylinders and some crap like that. So, the race that against, here it is, a Sessna 182,

134
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,160
not an RG mind you. And so they raised the airplane against the Bugatti and it was, it was

135
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:17,520
absolutely a fantastic, just a great montage. And I liked the in-plane shots as much as I did the in-car shots.

136
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,840
Oh, this is kind of interesting news. Apparently, comic book podcasting is the next big thing.

137
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,760
Adam and the rest of the daily source code listeners, my name's Neil Gorman and I wanted to take

138
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,360
a minute of your time to kind of make you guys aware of something which I think is some pretty

139
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,960
big news for the world of podcasting and the world of comic books. That news is that Marvel

140
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,160
comic books, which is a really well-known, very reputable company that has a lot of money and an

141
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,920
enormous fanbase, has started to podcast. And I think that this is just really, really wonderful news

142
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,480
for the world of podcasting because it shows that companies like Marvel that already do have a

143
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,680
big fanbase and already do have a lot of money, are really realizing that podcasting is a

144
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,240
viable way to disseminate information to their enormous fanbase. And actually, you know what

145
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,960
here, I'm just going to play a little clip from the first Marvel podcast so that you guys can kind of

146
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,960
hear this. And after we're going to come back and explain some of the things that are talked about

147
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,240
in this little clip for maybe some of the non comic book reading people out there. So the

148
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,360
sit tight if you don't understand everything that's being said right off the back because I'll

149
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,640
try to explain it in just a moment. Hey, that's your Lieber's Heart. It's Joke Sada,

150
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,040
Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics. And I want to welcome you all to our very very first Marvel

151
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,080
podcast. That's right, Marvel podcast. You heard it here for us. You will be here yet here first.

152
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,440
And who better to have us our guest for our first Marvel podcast, but Damon Lindelock.

153
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,840
You know, I can write a lot of little demons credits for you, but unless you've been in jail or

154
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,360
hiding under a rock, Damon is the co-creator and one of the major writers on the number one TV show

155
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,760
lost. And who is in a fan of lost? But then again, who is in a fan of Hulk and who is in a fan

156
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,560
of Wolverine and even Barrier, who is in a fan of Marvel's Ultimate Universe. So Damon,

157
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,200
along with superstar artists, L'Neal Francis, you, will be bringing you the first ever meeting

158
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,440
within the context of the Ultimate Universe of Wolverine versus Hulk at an ain pretty folks.

159
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay. Now, like I said, I'm going to try to clear up something which is going on here.

160
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,040
Damon Lindelock is a writer. He writes for the TV show lost. He is a co-creator on the TV show

161
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,120
lost. And now he is writing a comic book for Marvel Comics. That comic book is called Hulk

162
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,320
versus Wolverine. It's not out yet, but it's going to be hitting the new stance pretty soon. Adam,

163
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,080
you might be pretty interested in this. I know that you're a big fan of the TV show lost. And

164
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,320
I don't know if you read comic books, but you know, if you do, pretty sure this is a comic book

165
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,040
you're going to want to pick up. And if you don't, well, then maybe this is an excellent comic

166
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,560
book to start with. You know what I'm saying? Thank you Neil. Neil went on for a couple more minutes

167
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,680
there, but did think it was pretty interesting that Marvel Comics is doing their own podcast

168
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,000
from Marvel Comics herself. So that is, and there's lots of comic podcasts. I think I actually

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,520
have one coming up in the in the promo in a couple of minutes. Regarding that podcast, lots of echo.

170
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,680
Needed a little bit more cowbell. That's all. You know, every single time I mentioned cowbell,

171
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,920
you know, the people that immediately send me email and say, hey, man, what about the cowbell?

172
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,600
And how about the drum cadences? I don't have any drum cadences. Send me a new one. If you got one.

173
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,080
Send me a really good drum cadence. I love them. But I used to get them in the email all the time.

174
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,520
I'm talking about a year ago. We're doing drum cadence of the day. And I have them somewhere. But

175
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,200
if you got a cool drum cadence, send it off to me. I'll be more than happy. And speaking of the

176
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,280
the comic book authors who are the writers for Lost, where the hell is Lost? I don't get it. I've been

177
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,080
buying the Lost episodes through iTunes. And the last one I've seen on there for the past two weeks

178
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,280
is the Where is Kate episode? Did they stop all of sudden or iTunes, music store not updating? Or,

179
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,000
you know, what is it? It's another thing here. Why can't I subscribe to the entire series?

180
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,240
Just like a podcast. I mean, technically, it must be possible. So just say, all right, you know,

181
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,920
by every single episode, hell, I'm probably even willing to pay up front the 35 bucks or whatever

182
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,680
is for all the episodes. And then give me a subscription so that it'll just automatically download and

183
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,000
be sitting there for whenever I'm ready to watch any episode of Lost. So instead of going to the

184
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,200
iTunes music store to see if it lost as I updated, I'll just be able to look in my iTunes.

185
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,080
Makes so much sense. And again, where is Lost? I mean, I don't have a TV guide and I don't follow.

186
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,920
I don't even know what day it's on, but usually around Thursday or Friday it shows up in iTunes

187
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,960
or it shows up in iTunes, music store, and I haven't seen it for two weeks. So I guess they went on

188
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,920
some kind of winter hiatus or something, but I miss it. Email here from David Gray Adam after

189
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,800
listening to Delta Sierra Charlie 296 where you mentioned Roger Smalls and his trash can diving

190
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,000
adventures. I went to his site from the link in the show notes. Show notes work, you see.

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,240
Looking at his profile under interest are some very normal things like music computers, etc.

192
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,560
And then there are some strange ones like Jim Feet and Snow Globes. But the ones that really

193
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,720
got my attention and they should get yours too are hiding and kidnapping. I don't know, I'm not

194
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,720
trying to alarm you, but based on his previous behavior, expert caution seems to be in order.

195
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,800
I think some people have been in touch with Roger. I think he's just a big fan.

196
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't see, I've already requested he not go through my trash anymore. That kind of weirded me out

197
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,080
and he tried to put that up on Google base and they refused his entry.

198
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,360
Let me see. I saw it somewhere. I think I mentioned that to you, but I saw it on his web

199
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,800
log home. What is it? Roger. Roger Smalls.blogs.com. There we go. Let me see.

200
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,600
By the way, I'm doing this all on the on the laptop on the power book because

201
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,200
remember I set up a trisha with my iMac in her station in the kitchen. She's not given it back. Uh-huh.

202
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:22,560
In fact, I had another, another Bluetooth headset, you know, a little thing that you'd

203
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,800
hang along your ear, which I've, no, I just want to have two. One that I'd say really I

204
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,040
want to have one configured for Bluetooth for the power book and the other one configured for the cell phone.

205
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,120
And she said, oh, give me that too. So now she's doing freaking Skype calls with the Bluetooth headset.

206
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,160
She's out of control in my wife is before you know it, she'll be in chat rooms.

207
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,880
I'm trying to break out that country song, computer computer. Here it is. Roger Smalls.

208
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,200
Uh-huh. Hello. Thank you for submitting an item to Google base. We would like to inform you that we have

209
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,200
disabled your item entitled rare hair wax, which is the shitty took from my trash, because it's not

210
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,600
permitted by her program. Sales of human body parts are not allowed on Google base. This includes

211
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,400
hair follicles. This product has also not been approved by Adam Curry and therefore cannot be listed.

212
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,960
They never asked me if it was to if it could be approved. I don't know how that works, but

213
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,760
so I don't think Roger's going to be too much for a problem. He just seems like a really

214
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,920
enthusiastic guy. And we wanted enthusiastic people in podcasting. That's really what it's all about.

215
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:38,080
Okay. I asked and I received Jeff Smith. Man. Oh, you big time.

216
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,360
It's time everybody for our bio diesel segment on the daily source code. Please sing along.

217
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,120
We're going to sing your luxury. Oh,

218
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,760
Yeah, it's time to talk about the bio diesel industry. We call it our little Trinity segment.

219
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,480
Trinity is the egg nog yellow car that I purchased recently in San Francisco. It runs entirely

220
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,320
on bio diesel. It's a Mercedes 300 turbo diesel with the biodiesel conversion kit. We're not

221
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,120
even sure what that means yet, but it's got it. And it's an interesting industry, you know?

222
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,120
So today we'll be talking about throwing a granny in your tank fixing the wind shield and wind

223
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,240
signal out.

224
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,880
Yo, our first email today in our Trinity segment comes from

225
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,640
foghorn. That would be Nickleghorn from the Forensic Science podcast that Forensic Science podcast.

226
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Uni, that's uniform November, India dot CC. I just got home from a debate competition as we

227
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,200
can along Island in New York. One of the issues was on mandating more fuel efficient gasoline

228
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,000
powered cars. Thanks to you and Trinity, I successfully argued that we should completely switch to

229
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,440
biodiesel instead of for stalling the inevitable end of our gas reserves. Interestingly enough,

230
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,200
the next issue was on cutting off Medicare, a medical aid to US citizens. Someone came up with a

231
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,760
bright idea that we can kill two birds with one stone. The increased death rate would provide

232
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,800
more corpses and other matter to turn into biodiesel. However, the idea of sticking your

233
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:45,840
grandmother and your tank disturbed too many people for that to pass. So thanks Adam and Trinity for

234
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,160
helping me win my 14th debate and keep up the good work. I'll get a promo out to you soon

235
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,160
as we get more shows online. Okay fantastic. Very, very cool. Appreciate it. I'm still trying to figure

236
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,400
out exactly what I have. Do I have a conversion? Do I have a biodiesel conversion or not? I

237
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,600
know only have more than half a tank left. So it's not going to be until January. Second week of

238
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,120
January, I'll be back in San Francisco for a long haul back on the oil rig everybody and then we're

239
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,120
going to go to biodiesel oasis, Berkeley's biodiesel oasis and get the full low down and really

240
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,080
find out what's going on with the car. Then the next stop is the detailing shop. This thing has to be

241
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,040
washed. It has to be scrubbed. It needs the toothbrush detailing and then we start with the pimping.

242
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:36,480
Which would start of course with the windshields. Hey Adam Steve Webb here with the life-spring podcast.

243
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,200
So yesterday I'm listening to Delta CR Charlie number 297 and you're talking about this

244
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,720
beautiful example of automotive engineering. The beautiful yellow Mercedes Ben's biodiesel

245
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,000
beater. You're talking about how ugly it is and things like that. And you really got my attention

246
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,200
when you mentioned the windshield and the fact that it had a star on and a crack on and stuff like that.

247
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,800
Dude that's right at my alley. That's what I do for a living. That's what I do to put food on the

248
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,160
table is I fix those things on windshields. I don't replace windshields. I repair them. The name of my

249
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,320
business which started in 1988. I've done tens of thousands of windshield repairs. The name of the

250
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,440
business is Stargon. Stargon.com as a matter of fact is where you can look it up. But man, call me

251
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,800
a man. I can help you pimped that right out and make a pod show proud. So give me a call. You got my number

252
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,880
and hey, thanks for listening. God bless you man. I've got bless you Steve. Cool man.

253
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,360
See the problem with Steve is that he doesn't live in San Francisco. I think he lives a Southern

254
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,400
California. So I'd have to bring him up with his kit. Which I'm not against. But you know,

255
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
we really, I want to set it all up. So we do a whole bunch of things. Christina of course immediately

256
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,000
said, Dad, you got to me. You got to pimped out. So it bounces up and down. I don't know. Are there

257
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,680
hydraulic servo kits for Mercedes 300 turbo diesel? If there are, I'll put them on. And then we need

258
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:04,160
the paint job. I put a really cool one on my curry.com weblog the other day. Which would look,

259
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,200
what does that say? Curry West Coast Curry Cruiser, I think is what it read.

260
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,520
And so we'll just plan this a bit by bit. The first test of course will be when I come back

261
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,360
in a couple of weeks and see if she'll actually start. If we get that far, then I'll be totally

262
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,400
amazed. And then from there, we're going to start getting everything done.

263
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,160
Daniel Davis says biodiesols have a solvent effect on natural rubber hoses and seals. While newer

264
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,360
diesel engines have polymer hoses and seals such as deposits of the Tom brand, older engines may

265
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:44,560
need to be outfitted with new hoses and or seals made of viton, viton, viton. Since most diesel

266
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,400
injector pumps don't have rubber parts directly in contact with the fuel. It's usually easy to replace

267
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,560
hoses and seals without an image or disassembling. So I might need that. As long as nothing's

268
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:59,600
spewing out of any hoses, then I'm good. I mentioned Andy White, who sent me an email about

269
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:07,280
Winston. And that means it's a synthetic oil made in Wisconsin, duh. And he's happy to sell it to me

270
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,320
at cost. Which is cool. I guess that's not a big good. That makes it totally green, you know, a total

271
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:21,600
green experience. No petrochemical diesel oil at all, I guess. And he goes on to say, I look to

272
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
your photos of Trinity, but what you say is a biodiesel conversion kit looks like the air filter.

273
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,560
Yeah, a couple of people have said that. The tube in the top of the positive crankcase ventilation

274
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,720
hose, the tube in the top in the PCV, the positive crankcase ventilation hose. You don't need

275
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,800
a kit into car to use biodiesel only to make it. If you want to run stretch vegetable oil,

276
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,400
you do need a kit. Maybe I have a kit on that for straight vegetable oil. Christ, I really don't know.

277
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
He goes on to say, you should check out this band called road trip. They have two lead singers

278
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,600
so depending on which song you play, that kind of depends on who sings. Okay. So that's from Andy White.

279
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,040
Andy, I'm going to look into that. As I said, when I get back to San Francisco,

280
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,960
I may be all I'll shell. I'm not going to do a Trinity report every single day, obviously. But keep

281
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,120
comments coming in. If you can tell me what a conversion kit does, other than I think heat up the

282
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,080
the SVO, the straight virgin oil, so that it so doesn't gel. I think it makes, yeah, I think that's the

283
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,480
only thing that really needs to be put in there. Anyway, if you're listening to serious stars 103,

284
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,880
Pacific Coast, Hellway is next followed by Madge Weinstein and John Andrew have fun with that.

285
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,280
And back here on the podcast, the real fun continues because of course I'm going to hit you

286
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,920
with that song that Andy White suggested. If you got suggestions from the podcast,

287
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,280
say music network, please drop in to me. You know what I like. Here's two days in road trip.

288
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:18,160
You will handle with love as I'm as bad with respect. You'll you think you can love me.

289
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:31,280
Oh, why? Oh, come on. Yeah. I've been living for such a long time. You know what? No, I

290
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:43,280
don't know yet. I've been living for such a long time now, I know.

291
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:53,280
And I'll be good, that's right, I feel like I'm falling

292
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:59,280
And I can't see the land on the ground, on the moon

293
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,280
I've only got two days to get with it

294
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,280
I gotta get with it, I gotta sing it

295
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Can you give me the answer?

296
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Can you give me the answer?

297
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,280
All right, and will you please forgive me?

298
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:27,280
It's all I want, all right, I gotta be all right, all right

299
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:35,280
I've been living for such a long time, and no one knows where it is

300
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Now it's too easy for me to go out, yeah

301
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:14,280
And I can't see the land on the moon

302
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:20,280
I've only got two days to get with it, I gotta sing it

303
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Can you give me the answer?

304
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,280
All right, and will you please forgive me?

305
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,280
I gotta be good, good, good, good

306
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,280
Two days that I'll be good

307
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,280
I'll be good, I'll be good, yeah

308
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Two days that I'll be good

309
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,280
I'll be good, I'll be good

310
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,280
I'll be good, I'll be good

311
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
I'll be good, I'll be good

312
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Oh, got out of me

313
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Two days that I'll be good

314
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Two days that I'll be good

315
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
I'll be good, go to your family

316
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Hurry up and find my way

317
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,280
I'll be good, I'll have to pick you

318
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Nice.

319
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Totally digged out.

320
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Thank you very much.

321
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
I was cool.

322
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I liked that a lot.

323
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
They had a couple other songs and some other guys singing.

324
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
So I'm not exactly sure who this is.

325
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Hold on one second.

326
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Oh yeah, I got to start the week off just right.

327
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
You know what I'm saying?

328
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,920
Well, sources on some Matthew Ebo press, Matthew Ebo, of course, another star from the

329
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Podsaic Music Network.

330
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
It was really interesting.

331
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,760
He did an interview with the Tennessean, a big newspaper in Nashville, as a part of the

332
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,160
money makeover feature.

333
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,280
Matthew says that he really pressed hard to try and get some press for the Podsaic Music

334
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:11,680
Network, which I totally appreciate and actually have the article here.

335
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:19,680
It does actually say, well, it does mention something about the Podsaic Music Network.

336
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,160
But really, this article is really interesting, and of course we'll have a link to it from

337
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
the show notes page.

338
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,440
You can find the link to the show notes at dailysourcecode.com, show notes for each

339
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
episode.

340
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,400
And if you go to show notes.info, it's a week easy.

341
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,000
So you can go in and mess with it and take credit for my show.

342
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,600
But it talks about all about Matthew, who has completely dedicated his life to making music.

343
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,880
And he really clearly wants to quit his day job.

344
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,240
He pays his bills with a day job, answering phones that a Brentwood mortgage company.

345
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,520
They pays about $11 an hour.

346
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,440
But he does say, he nets an additional $1200 a year from other sources such as selling

347
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,800
CDs and working on websites.

348
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,960
But his goal is to be self-employed to standing himself entirely as a performing musician.

349
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,200
My brother, keep the dream alive.

350
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,840
We've been working behind the scenes.

351
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,440
The Podsaic Music Network to get the purchasing up and running.

352
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
We've already selected our vendor for that.

353
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:25,960
It's got some great ways that'll make it even easier to pay and to get the music that

354
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
you're looking for.

355
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Straight to the Podsaic Music Network.

356
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,880
We have a meeting also set up with Google the week of the ninth in San Francisco for

357
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,360
the indexing of the Podsaic Music Network in the Music Search on Google.

358
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,920
And I see no reason why it wouldn't happen.

359
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,760
But yeah, I definitely want to take a meeting with him about it.

360
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
That's very cool.

361
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,920
So, keep you up to speed on that.

362
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:54,160
Something else that we've been tracking is the Music Publishers Association of America

363
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,560
who are going after sites that publish lyrics to songs.

364
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,800
And there was this one little widget.

365
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,520
I guess it's called confabulator.

366
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,560
Or it was originally called confabulator.

367
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,520
Then widgets appeared in OS 10 and confabulators what you can use widgets for on Windows.

368
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,960
Let's see how this is made.

369
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,720
Facing an ups well of protest, Warner Chapel, Music on Friday, formally apologized

370
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,840
to Walter Ritter, over a letter it sent to the software program.

371
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,600
Her early this month targeting a helper application that'll be the widget for Apple's iTunes

372
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,960
called Pearl lyrics quote, the goal of Warner Chapel's prior letter to

373
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,840
pair works was to gain assurance that pair licks operated according to copyright

374
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,360
principles.

375
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,480
However, in both tone and substance, that means that letter was an an of inappropriate

376
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,920
manner in which to convey that inquiry, Warner Chapel apologizes to Walter Ritter

377
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,760
and pair works.

378
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,680
In other words, I said an asshole letter fucking asshole letter.

379
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,120
Anyway, they apologize.

380
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,040
That's very cool.

381
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,280
But of course, the whole point of this article, it's a wired article that talks about

382
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,280
this is that, you know, here, I think even Ritter says it to himself here.

383
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,360
I'm concerned with how I should go on with software development because this will be a potential issue.

384
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,400
Every time I cope with something that people like someone might say, you can't do that.

385
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
It's illegal.

386
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,960
It infringes copyright.

387
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,680
It's getting really difficult to be innovative as a small developer.

388
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Absolutely true.

389
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,160
Well, I think that's a good start there for for Warner Chapel to realize their

390
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,200
mistakes and to apologize and just I guess be, you know, think a little bit more.

391
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
That's all.

392
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,640
Just before you fire off that season to Swiss Lighter, just think for two seconds.

393
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:47,320
Because it's clear the webloggers and the podcasters are watching you.

394
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,480
It's the crank cast starring crank and mic.

395
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,120
A weekly look into the minds of two comic book professionals as they discuss their

396
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,120
favorite comics, movies, music, and pretty much all the stuff you like to hear

397
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,800
when you're not talking about it yourself.

398
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,600
This is a really sharp middle America.

399
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,200
There was so much better before he went to read.

400
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
My part is the lack of teeth as there has been no time.

401
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,040
It's got the popularity of Garfield.

402
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,800
It's not as evil as a kid, like I couldn't draw muscles, but I'll be damned if I didn't know

403
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
what to help pack an absolute life.

404
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,360
This is the most revealing crank cast.

405
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,720
Yeah.

406
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Jefferson Cranging.

407
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,200
I started very, very come back to mic.

408
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,840
You can see dolls, other ones make it ass.

409
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,160
Okay, pants sparkle.

410
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,480
Hello, this is Cranging Mike and this is dead air.

411
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,160

Listen to Cranking Mike because every time you get a crank cast,

413
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,760
it's an angel gets its wings.

434
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
shot.

435
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Well, you know what?

436
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:51,040
I'm a podcaster now, and because I'm at a furry and podcaster, I can quit my day

job.

448

We're in the ghost of Tech Christmas present.

459
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,420
Ghost. Tech Christmas future.

460
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,500
Blah, blah, blah.

461
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:24,380
A geek Christmas Carol presented by friends in Tech. Friends in Tech.com.

462
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,100
So I was asked to participate in the Geek Christmas Carol.

463
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:34,860
And of course I missed all deadlines and I just got an email now that says I can still do my

464
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,340
bit so I'm going to do it. I haven't read the whole script. I only saw a side as we call it in

465
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,460
the biz and it involves real acting. I'm going to have to really get into it. But I think the whole

466
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,700
idea is cool. You know, then I guess I can do it in episodes. I don't know if it's going to be a

467
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,820
if it's all going to be in one go or if it must be episodes I guess. So you can check that out

468
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,900
friends in Tech. I think it's friends in Tech.com. But I'll make sure to let you know all about

469
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,820
it once once it's done. Particularly if they use my bit, it'll be cool. And if you have an

470
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,460
eggnog recipe since there's like no eggnog here in the UK is something that's simple.

471
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,540
Yet and I want an alcoholic eggnog so I want to know exactly how much rum or whatever to put in it.

472
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,340
Just drop me a mail. Adamaccurry.com. Talking about the razors and shaving,

473
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:23,100
which I'm getting a whole bunch of feedback on. And I guess I am the ultimate metro-sexual

474
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:29,180
in this particular case because, you know, guys really don't talk about this kind of stuff.

475
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,900
You know, beauty and health care, health beauty care.

476
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,940
Hey Adam, are you sure? You've not been spending too many nights away from Patricia,

477
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:46,380
says Leo Vagoda. I have a feeling that you're talking about a badger hair brush. Not a beaver hair brush.

478
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,420
The dude, it is a beaver hair brush. I remember when I bought it, it said original

479
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:58,700
beaver hair. Not badger beaver. You know, beaver from the dams. In any case, I can confirm that

480
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,980
Gillette's M3 power razor is excellent. I'd be using it for months and wouldn't change. Even though I'm

481
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,060
unhappy using a blade, even though I'm unhappy using a blade more than twice. No greeny me. Yeah,

482
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:15,820
okay. So you throw a blade out after two uses. Okay. Shit. Patricia already left for Sainsbury's.

483
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,220
Later this week, I'll pick one up. I'll give it a try. Who knows? I might change my life. I'm still

484
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:26,540
really digging that Wilkinson for blade. Brand Bradley says you've always said that when you

485
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:31,100
burped on the ball of loss and say, oh, thank you, we go. Use kills shaving cream. That's

486
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:37,820
kilo India echo hotel Lima. Brushless shaving cream. It's the best. Just put a dab on your hand, rub

487
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,740
your hands together like you're washing your hands and put it on your face. Okay. But isn't the

488
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:48,300
whole point of the brush is to get your hair like raised up and raise up the bristles? I thought that's

489
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,100
what the brush was for. I mean, if you can do with your hands, then why do I run stupid brush?

490
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,460
There must be a real reason for it. Matt's not grass to wind it up. I was listening to Delta

491
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,020
share Charlie 299er and heard you discussing razors. Like the one listener you mentioned, the

492
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:07,100
Gillette M3 power razor. I too, an avid Gillette razor fan. Never want to fall for the

493
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,860
micro marketing hype. Let me tell you, these Gillette razors just keep getting better. The latest

494
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,260
one out, the M3 power is the one that Paul says has a chaves. It's like rubbing the back of a

495
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:22,700
soup spoon across your face. Excellent endorsement. Next year, early 2006, Gillette will be releasing

496
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:29,180
the fusion and fusion power. This will have five blades plus an extra precision blade on the back

497
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,660
for under your nose or your sideburns. That's fucking six blades. That's nuts, man.

498
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:43,260
Okay, now I'll have to something else. Dustin Moat just got the Tvo update that plays podcast on

499
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,700
his TV. I'm listening to you right now. Totally loving it. Excellent. He says, I've been a bad

500
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,020
podcast. I pulled the needle two months ago. I will rectify this immediately. Thanks for the shame.

501
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,540
I guess you'd stop listening. I don't know if you stop listening to this show or all

502
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:04,540
all shows all together. But that is kind of cool. I wouldn't mind. We don't have Tvo's here.

503
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:09,180
They have sky digital. I don't think there's any openness to them, which is too bad. The whole

504
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,780
Tvo thing is too bad. You know, people often wonder why the content is relatively restricted.

505
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:20,060
And that's because the investors in Tvo are the television networks. Go look it up. The investors

506
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:26,380
in Tvo are the television networks. I think it's actually a consortium of ABCMBCCBS. I know

507
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,900
a whole bunch of broadcasters are invested in it. So that's why, you know, there's a agenda there.

508
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,900
And that agenda is not necessarily to let all kinds of cool shit in. Rumors still that Rocket

509
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:43,180
Boom was purchased by Tvo, and Amanda has been making all kinds of insinuations about stuff.

510
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:49,260
So maybe conversations are ongoing. Love the Rocket Boom. Love it. Right up there with lost,

511
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:56,540
if it were on. Let's see. James E said, oh, this is regarding tattoos.

512
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,420
Okay, I think the bear in mind is you won't regret having a tattoo later. You won't. The

513
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,660
thing to remember about a tattoo is that you won't care about it later. How does that mean?

514
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:12,380
Just a thing on your body. No, I will care about it. I'm already have some very cool

515
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:19,020
ideas, tattoo ideas, which have been sent in to Adamaccurry.com. So definitely the pilot's wings.

516
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,780
Now we have like a musical key, the clef. I think it's called clef, a G.K.

517
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,540
Whatever in the middle. And then very to us, litter us, or some Latin word like that, which

518
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:37,580
could mean you suck bottom. I still have some stuff. You know, I have this whole thing about

519
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,740
performance, right in all different countries. I'm going to save that for tomorrow, because

520
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,420
I can't just do one. I've got five different stories to talk to you about. So we'll do that tomorrow

521
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,940
in the podcaster portion of the daily source code, which is always kind of the second half if you

522
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,260
will. We're already at 41, what almost 42 minutes. I want to play one more song. And this is what

523
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,460
came to me in the in the Gmail. Hey, Adam, thank you for being a voice for podcasting,

524
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:06,940
make it reality blah blah. I met you back in the MTV days when I was the base player for Vixen.

525
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:14,060
Remember Vixen? Currently, I host my own podcast. I like video podcast better, actually.

526
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,380
And play guitar and sing in bubble, who are on the pod save music. Now, where bubble is receiving

527
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,900
daily, daily airplay. That would be pod play through the PMN, which is fantastic. The video podcast

528
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,300
is called Rock and Roll TV, and we're currently getting over 16,000 downloads per episode.

529
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,220
After only one month, and we're very excited about it. That's fantastic. This is from Share

530
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,820
Ross, which used to be Share Peterson. And I had heard about bubble. I can't remember who I

531
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,780
heard it from. But then I checked out a couple of songs and I picked out one that I liked the most.

532
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,340
And definitely take a look at the video at the Rock and Roll TV podcast. This got

533
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:53,100
something good going on there. So here it is. This is, uh, oh, wait, man, this is completely wrong.

534
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,380
Fuck. The hell is that? I had something else cute. Oh, okay. I understand what I did. I skipped

535
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,780
over a piece of feedback for the performance rights. Okay. So that'll be tomorrow. As I said,

536
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,780
here's bubble. This is Sparkle Star.

537
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:47,100
Just smile in my heart. I always walk away. Every time I look at you, I can't believe I'll

538
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,340
love again.

539
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:05,340
Didn't mean to make you cry. But make you love so hard. But didn't mean to make you say goodbye

540
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:16,140
or find a fine try. Yeah, shaking on the floor. Come on, still not so. The world just get out

541
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:30,540
of them. And we're seeing I can't make you understand my song. Yeah, I always walk away.

542
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:38,780
But every time I look at you, I can't believe I'll love again.

543
00:44:38,780 --> 00:45:08,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

544
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:38,780
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, free,, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,, do

545
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:45,780
Just let it always get inside my head

546
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,780
I don't want you away

547
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,780
Cause every time I make it true

548
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,780
I can't believe I'll ever love again

549
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,780
I don't know

550
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,780
Maybe I'm just for you

551
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,780
Why will we stop your star?

552
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:24,780
Yeah, I'll be your big star, your star

553
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,780
Just like you

554
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,780
Didn't mean to make you cry

555
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,780
I'm making you fall so high

556
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:42,780
Burn it down and turn you crazy

557
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:48,780
Never think I'll make you feel

558
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,780
All I wanted you to feel

559
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,780
Bubble

560
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,780
A lot of safe music network

561
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,780
Music.potcho.com

562
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,780
More pot safe music network.com

563
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,780
Very cool

564
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,780
Just looked up a couple of pictures of Vixen

565
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,780
Yeah, yeah

566
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,780
Yeah, I was cool back in the day

567
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,780
Back in the old school days

568
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,780
All right, that's it for the daily source code for today

569
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,780
I'm gonna wrap it up

570
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,780
Be back tomorrow, Wednesday

571
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
Probably won't have a show

572
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,780
Since I'm gonna be off to see my mom

573
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,780
But then, of course, we'll have a show for the rest of the week

574
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,780
And I guess I'll do something on Christmas too

575
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,780
Cause we can figure out something fun to do

576
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,780
As always, daily source code.com is where you can find out

577
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,780
The latest podcast and the feed to subscribe to

578
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,780
Just copy the link that's attached to that orange

579
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,780
On white XML icon

580
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,780
And you can drop that into your iTunes if you want

581
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,780
You can search for it on iTunes as well

582
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,780
But iTunes doesn't always update regularly

583
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,780
So you may want to choose to subscribe to it directly

584
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,780
Or, of course, in your juice receiver

585
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,780
Absolutely, to mom

586
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,780
Feedback, adamantcurry.com

587
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,780
And still, in the works for this week

588
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,780
I've gotten some feedback for the strategy cast

589
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,780
If you have questions about pod show

590
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,780
Or what we're gonna be doing

591
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,780
Or if you have observations or any suggestions

592
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,780
Regarding pod casting stuff we can do

593
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,780
To put into the network

594
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Email it to strategycast at podshow.com

595
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,780
All right, everybody

596
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,780
Oh, this is a Sue's lighter than I stole

597
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,780
Hey, that's it. I'll see you tomorrow

598
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,780
Bye bye

599
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,780
Pot show

00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,780
All you need is a podcast and a dream
