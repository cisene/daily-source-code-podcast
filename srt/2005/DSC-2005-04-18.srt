00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Daily source code April 18, 2005.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
$16 million worth of airplane strap to my ass.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey, everybody.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
How you doing?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A brand new week.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's Monday the 18th of April.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We are back at the cottage.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Sheel and out in the big green thing.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I've got the cast blast of Roland.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I've kind of extended all the wires.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So I'm sitting in the reclining green thing.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's a big ass chair.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
With a laptop with a pen and a microphone.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the infamous words of back what more do you need than two turn tables in a microphone?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ah, good to be back with you.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Good to have the microphone.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The big setup, which of course is plugged in through the little box.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
My father-in-law made to give it the perfect signal into the microphone in.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I got all kinds of stuff lined up for you.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We've got a mash-up, a young pull-out is sent me another hit test.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And of course a couple of tunes.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As always, I'm going to play for you here on the source code.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So trippy to be using the pen on the screen.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't have this tablet.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It basically is a laptop where you can do as you can open up the screen and swivel it.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And then twist it backwards and fold it up over the keyboard.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Which gives it that distinct tablet feel.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But basically I'm just using a combination out of the mouse and the pen.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Because with the pen I can just point to the screen grab the fader and crank it up or crank it down and hit the microphone button.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A beautiful system.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, lots of stuff to talk about today.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Maybe the first observation I have to make is that I am getting a little discouraged with Gmail.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Although I still totally dig what Gmail brings to the party with search-based email.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I really am enjoying using that and you're able to open up your email on a browser anywhere and keep all these browser windows open.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Great way to synchronize of course across multiple machines.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And I have three now that I'm using full time.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I've got the power book which is hooked up to the sound system and to the mixer of course.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's what I use.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's what I use my iPod or on.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I can listen to podcasts and actually schedule them in a different Mac program called Megaseg.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So that can kind of format them.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So I have different shows playing in different.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I kind of arrange the order in which they come in based upon some rules.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have a lot of fun with that actually creating my own radio station here at home which just runs continuously.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And even if I walk out of the room and come back later, you know, I have it scheduled so certain things repeat after a while.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If it's a real short podcast and if I might not have heard it then it'll just play later on.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And if something comes up that I've heard I hit a key and then it identifies that I've already heard it moves on to the next one.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's something I'm playing around with something that I think will be effective for home, car and personal walking around uses as we move podcasting into even more convenient ways to listen.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So to Gmail, I don't know but I'm getting a hell of a lot of spam.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And here's the disappointing part.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You know, you have this.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What does it? What do they call it? Reports spam? Let me just see.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm just take a quick look at my Gmail here.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If it's spam, they call it.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm on pulling it up here.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, report spam, right?

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I report spam all the time.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And what you'd think is that by hitting the report spam button that essentially, you know, Gmail would know,

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
okay, this is spam. We won't show that to you anymore, but it just keeps on coming back.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The same forms of spam, the same, you know, from the same spammer, basically.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And then you have the report fishing and fishing spelled with PH is a form of tricking users into thinking that you're getting an email from.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Typically, it's PayPal or Amazon or, you know, one of these big services that you probably actually have an account with.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And they fake it so that it looks like it's real only if you were to click on these links.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And usually it's like, you know, we need to verify your account or, you know, provide us your password.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Of course, you're not supposed to do that anyway.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But, you know, you have this, all these dialogue boxes so you can report this fishing activity.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And I don't know, do these guys do anything with it? I'm just literally, if I look at one full page of Gmail.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So that's 50 emails, what I have it set to, at least 60% is spam.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And it's, and yeah, you can navigate through it pretty quickly, but it's not, it sucks.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And then you have this creative filter.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And that would be another great way to do it.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know, it's just creative filter based upon this email, but the creative filter still forces you to fill out, you know, the fields,

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
what you want to be filtered out.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So it's not working for me that well anymore.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And, you know, I like my adamantcurry.com, which forwards to my Gmail account.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I want to keep that, you know, I want to keep my Gmail account.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't want to switch accounts. I want to keep it all as it is.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But the spam is just becoming cumbersome and a big burden.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So the question to the guys over at Google is, what the hell are you doing about the spam?

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hi, Adam, this is Greg in New York.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I want to tell you about my new podcast, celebrityvinylheaven.com.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's the only podcast devoted to records made by your favorite TV and movie stars.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
People like William Schatter, Telly Savolis, Mr. T and more.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Whether you love him or you love to hate him, we always have a good time at celebrityvinylheaven.com.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
As another thing I've really been missing out on is playing the promo.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And people, I guess the MP3 feedback at gmail.com isn't working anymore.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I get a whole bunch of reports that email is still getting bounced back.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So the best thing to do is, you know what we should do?

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I could set up a filter for this. This would be great.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If you want to send me a promo for your podcast, send it to adamantcurry.com.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And in the subject line, put dsc space promo.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because I'll filter based upon that and then don't attach the file.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Just put a URL to somewhere where I can pick the file up so that my gmail account doesn't overload.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Even though we have two gigs now, hold on, let me grab my tea.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not drinking a scentsato today. I'm having a nice cup of tea.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I had already like three scentsails this morning.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I'm buzzing.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So let's do it that way.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And then I'll set up a filter so that it'll be easier for me to manage the incoming promos.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And they're getting really cool.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
People are putting some real thought into the promo,

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
they're sending and I appreciate it.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I love playing them for you.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm here for the gang bang.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Wait, what was that?

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm here for the gang bang?

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, well, listen to that again.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm here for the gang bang.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hey Adam, it's Kevin Crossman from the Frat Pack podcast.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You know the Frat Pack, Ben Stiller Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Ben Spawn.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
All those guys in this comedy movies,

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
will we cover it all on the Frat Pack podcast?

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Including this little ditty that you might recognize.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So fun, Adam.

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This isn't really a hit test, but see if you can recognize this.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I know what it is.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, yes.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, yeah.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, yeah.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How could you ever forget David's soul?

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't give up on his baby.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't make them seem right.

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If you choose and just get it, Adam.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's David's soul.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The original Hatch from Strasking Hatch with his version of Don't Give Up on Us Baby.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That was a number one hit in 1977.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You and your listeners will want to check out our recent Strasking Hatch musical special,

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
including a version of that song from Owen Wilson.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Alright, cool.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, we cover all the weird wacky fun with the Frat Pack on our Frat Pack podcast.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Just go to www.capedo.com, K-E-V-D-O, dot com to learn more about the Frat Pack.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Check out the wedding crazier starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and the summer.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And that's it, thanks Adam.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, it was a Frat Pack.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Get another podcast.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Let's check in the iPodr.org directory.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now, well over 5,000 podcasts listed and actively tracked in the directory.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
iPodr.org.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We are really kicking some ass with this stuff.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So I'm going to play a song for you.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is something that I wanted to play on Saturday when I did my last podcast from Central Park.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think I even mentioned it at the end of the show.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It would have been nice to have had the cast blaster with me to kind of like fade this one in.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
While I was sitting there listening to the birds chirping and the kids playing.

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A man-son ice cream singing Italian song Chicago Saturday in the park.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I like the night in the morning.

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think it was the fun of July.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
People can't see people laughing.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A man selling ice cream singing Italian song.

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that they can't even say that.

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
One other day, you're the heart.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think it was the fun of July.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
One other day, you're the heart.

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I think it was the fun of July.

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
People can't really smell it.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm happy singing for a song.

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Will you help me change the world?

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Can you take it?

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, I can.

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I've been waiting so long time.

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I will take it.

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Slow motion riders.

166
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Fly the colors of the beat.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
A crowd's man still can't tell stories in some way.

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
These children all have lost.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
All have lost all have lost.

170
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:19,000
For the day, you're the heart.

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think it was the fun of July.

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
For the day, you're the heart.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think it was the fun of July.

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
People can't really smell it.

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
People can't really smell it.

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
People can't really smell it.

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
People can't really smell it.

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
People can't really smell it.

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
People can't really smell it.

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
People can't really smell it.

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
People can't really smell it.

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
People can't really smell it.

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:12,000
People can't really smell it.

184
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Chicago Saturday in the park.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think it was the 4th of July.

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Actually, I'll be spending this 4th of July in the United States.

187
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll be in Portland, Oregon.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Here's the deal.

189
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm doing a keynote at Nomdex.

190
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What is that somewhere around the 23rd, I believe, 24th?

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, 23rd through 25th, the thing is Nomdex 5.

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Instead of flying straight back from Seattle, which is where Nomdex is being held,

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm going to go to Portland, Oregon.

194
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's where I'm going to hook up on the 27th, I think, with the Wing Commander.

195
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Wing Commander William, my flight instructor.

196
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He will be going to do some training for a couple days.

197
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
On the 2nd or 3rd, I'll be getting my fixed wing ticket,

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
my PPL, my private pilot's license.

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Of course, if all goes according to plan.

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Lots of training between then and now.

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's actually cranking up tomorrow.

202
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We've got the airport right nearby tomorrow.

203
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The Wing Commander will be showing up.

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I guess somewhere between 8 and 9 a.m. he'll be flying over from Antwerp with the Cessna 182 RG.

205
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
RG stands for retractable gear.

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Then we're going to do some training all day Tuesday and then check this out.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Wednesday, we're also going to do some flight training Wednesday, but first at 11 a.m. on Wednesday.

208
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The Dutch Marines, I think I told you the story when we did a weeklong broadcast from Iraq

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
from Camp Smitty. I was all live on Dutch radio.

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We were there in the compound and also went all over the place with these guys

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
to different camps, different cities, different towns within South Western Iraq.

212
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What was cool about that broadcast wasn't so much.

213
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Of course, it was great that people back home could hear what we were experiencing

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and we were talking to Marines and they were giving shoutouts back home.

215
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I still get parents coming up to me saying thank you so much for building that virtual bridge

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
between me and my child, which was just that really blew me away.

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It still does when people come up to me and say that.

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But I had a 100 watt FM transmitter, a professional transmitter that I somehow acquired somewhere along the line

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
in my broadcast days. I used to use that at the castle so that you could just put a tuner on or a CD

220
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and put one sound source and hear that throughout the entire place just by tuning in the FM radio.

221
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't need that so much anymore now that we have streaming iTunes and all that stuff.

222
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But I had taken that over with me and we set it up at the base camp so that the Marines,

223
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
at that point, had listened to all of their CD collections at least 15 or 20 times and were pretty bored.

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I could actually listen to our broadcasts, not just our broadcasts.

225
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Excuse me, but we also had a satellite dish with a downlink.

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So they could also listen 24 hours a day to the radio station radio Veronica is the station that we did that for.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And I remember distinctly walking around through the tents and the prefab units and seeing groups of people

228
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
huddled around the radio just listening, listening to the radio, doing nothing else but looking at the wireless.

229
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The way it used to be when back in the day before television you'd sit down.

230
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Martha, Martha, I've got Pittsburgh on the wireless, you know, the green hornet show.

231
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And so we decided right then and there, I wouldn't leave this transmitter, you know,

232
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and Veronica was also kind enough to leave their downlink and their satellite dish.

233
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And so for the god how long have they been there a year and a half now or a little, yeah, but a year and a half I guess.

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You know, they were able to follow along with everything going on back home and it really boosted morale, which of course was the whole point in the first place.

235
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And the Dutch marines have now left.

236
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think the English are pretty much now.

237
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The English and Japanese are now in the camps MIDI, keeping watch.

238
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And the Dutch marines are back.

239
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And so they want to, you know, obviously return my transmitter.

240
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Now, you got to know that, you know, we built up quite a relationship with a number of these guys.

241
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And as does happen when you're in fricking desert, you know, surrounded by potential danger.

242
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Certainly, we were making friends left and right.

243
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And so they decided to do something rather unique.

244
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And I'm supposed to show up on a field in Holland, in Nardin, which is near Hilversum at 11 o'clock.

245
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I guess they're going to show up with a cougar helicopter.

246
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And four or five marines are going to repel down with the transmitter and give it back to me.

247
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So they're putting on a show.

248
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I'm really looking forward to that.

249
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And of course, I'll be doing some sound seeing over the next few days.

250
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And I, oh, that's what I wanted to mention.

251
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I picked up when I was last day in New York, Ron and I went to RCS Experience, which is the store on,

252
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
it's like, it's across from Sony's building.

253
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So it's like Madison in 55 to 56.

254
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And it's just a store with cool gadgets, all, you know, laptops, hand-held,

255
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
satellite radio receivers, and everything you could need to go along with that, you know, like headphones.

256
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
In fact, I got a new headset.

257
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I got a a send-hizer headset with built-in microphone, which is built specifically for gaming.

258
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And I'm very happy with the quality of it.

259
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm not using it now, obviously, I'm using my regular microphone, I'm sure, through the,

260
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
through the, the processor so we get the sound that I want.

261
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But it's really very nice headset, particularly for Skype.

262
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And the main reason is that it doesn't go over your head, but it goes behind your neck.

263
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You know, it's one of those types of headsets, which is great because I wear it.

264
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
My glasses almost all the time since I discovered that glasses give you much better vision than contact lenses.

265
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And if you're a spectacle where you'll know that putting the headset on really after about 10,

266
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
15 minutes, just want to kill yourself from the pain because, you know, the,

267
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
the feet of your glasses start digging into your head because of the pressure from the headphones.

268
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And of course, I could take them off, but then, you know, I'm basically, you know, blind, I can't see anything.

269
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And in the store, there was, I think, oops, sorry, I think I have, I'm going to put it to my back here somewhere.

270
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This, of course, is the drawback of sitting in the big green thing with the laptop.

271
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm not very mobile. I can't just hop up and go somewhere here. It's my bag.

272
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a brand new belkin. I started in high belkin.

273
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Griffin lapel microphone.

274
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And it's, uh, because the only drawback really is that it's white.

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So, you know, you can pretty, you can really see that I'm wearing a microphone.

276
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But it's a stereo mic, and I tried it with the eye river, and I'm really pleased with the sound.

277
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And particularly because this is a stereo mic, you get a whole different vibe than the stuff I've been using.

278
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And the microphone only costs like, yeah, I don't know.

279
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Do I have the, I don't have the receipt, but I think it was maybe like 19 bucks or something.

280
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And, you know what, I recorded a short test, a sound seeing test.

281
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh, this is not going to do something dangerous here. I'm going to see if I can open.

282
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Now, this is true integration, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to open up in the cast blaster on the windows tablet.

283
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm going to my network places.

284
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And it should say, let me see, I should be able to open up my, yes.

285
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I can open up, I can access my Mac because it has windows sharing enabled.

286
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm going to go to the desktop now, let me see if I can find it.

287
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I think this is it.

288
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, let me just select it.

289
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So, you know, the big benefit here is that it, it's just a microphone.

290
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So it doesn't have a preamp or in the case of the stuff that I have.

291
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It doesn't, that I've been using with my wireless mic set.

292
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I have to carry these two black boxes with me.

293
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And this, well, hold on a second, let's see if this is it.

294
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah.

295
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay, this is a, a test of the new setup.

296
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Hold on a second.

297
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Right, so I was in the lobby of the, the Waldorf Hotel,

298
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
while I was, while I plugged it in.

299
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So basically all I have is just my eye river.

300
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I've got my, my little iPod headphones plugged into listen to it.

301
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And then I plugged the, the griffin mic in and listened to the quality.

302
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And listen to the, particularly the stereo sound.

303
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
With the brand new microphone, stereo microphone.

304
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And I think I'm digging it already, this listening to what's on my headphones.

305
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's so dynamic, you can hear.

306
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's really popping out my, my ear buds here.

307
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I put my bag on walking through the lobby of the Waldorf Historian.

308
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's just completely cool.

309
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Lots of intelligent talk there, curry.

310
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
stereo system.

311
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
stereo mic.

312
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And you can really hear it's by Norl recording, even.

313
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Not quite sure about sounds a little bit nasal perhaps.

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But wow.

315
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Getting a great stereo.

316
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Soundscape.

317
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And I got the headphones on.

318
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And we just, for this, focus a little bit this.

319
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Come on.

320
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Wanted to help.

321
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Well, I think we shouldn't do too often.

322
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Probably like health, style, microphone.

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I can already tell that I probably need a.

324
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Probably need a wind screen to make it work in all situations.

325
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I plugged directly into the audio in.

326
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay, the idea.

327
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What do you want to say, actually, about my I River, I had a 799.

328
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So there's no windscreen at the package.

329
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay, there you go.

330
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So you get the idea, what we've essentially now created is the perfect sound

331
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
scene to were set up.

332
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So that's the I River, IFP 799.

333
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And using the Griffin lapel stereo microphone, which I haven't

334
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
been able to find it online, actually.

335
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Maybe it's brand new or whatever.

336
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm very, very pleased with it.

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The sound is, it's good.

338
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It sounded a bit nasal, but also it was just clipped onto my, onto the collar

339
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
of my, I was wearing a light sweater.

340
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So it was underneath my mouth and I could have positioned it in a different place

341
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and we'll probably get better audio.

342
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And I do need a windscreen for it, because of course I've already heard this

343
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
15 minute test or whatever it is.

344
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And the other minute, the wind hits it.

345
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It really hits it hard and it's a bit much.

346
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So I'm going to try and figure out a way to create a little windscreen or something.

347
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Maybe piece of panty hose that I'll cut from one of Patricia's nylon.

348
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh man, you know that could end a marriage right there.

349
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That's a dangerous thing to do.

350
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
People who listen to jump cut radio with Devon and Nathan are experiencing a breakthrough.

351
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm full!

352
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That's right, they're full.

353
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
All of new movie reviews celebrity news and info on overlooked classics in cinema.

354
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Here's just a sampling of what you can expect.

355
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's become ridiculous.

356
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I was over at Best Buy yesterday.

357
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And the ocean swells the only days out.

358
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Really?

359
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So the DVD's 20 bucks, 20 bucks.

360
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That's a little steep for one desk.

361
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That's almost as ridiculous as guess.

362
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's copy protected on the back.

363
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It has a big old X or something.

364
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It says this disc will only play on certain players, which usually means it won't do shit on a Mac.

365
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But here's the clincher.

366
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No special features.

367
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's really getting on my nerves.

368
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Nothing.

369
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
For 20 bucks, you get the movie.

370
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Then that's for inch subtitles.

371
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So my advice to everyone out there,

372
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
wait until you find a copy of Ocean's 12 and some like bargain bins.

373
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
If I'm not getting any special features, damn it.

374
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Why in about it, William?

375
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah, well.

376
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
After listening to just one episode of Jump Cut Radio,

377
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you will have lost 10 pounds.

378
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
guaranteed for your money back.

382
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
as long as they're views match our own.

383
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Jump Cut Radio.

384
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Movie banter for people with nothing better to do.

385
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Bloded Lesby and welcome.

386
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So let's talk about two things there.

387
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
First, Ocean's 12.

388
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I think I mentioned that that was the movie on the flight back from Denver.

389
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And it was very disappointed by this movie.

390
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It was cool because parts of it were filmed in Amsterdam.

391
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And there was a big, you know,

392
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
it was a big to do to have, you know, Brad Pitt and George Clooney and Julia Roberts all

393
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
walking around Amsterdam.

394
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So that was cool.

395
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The movie was just, I don't know.

396
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It was like, you know, who cares?

397
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It was a thin plot.

398
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah.

399
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It was just, I don't know.

400
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It wasn't for some reason.

401
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It just didn't work as well for me.

402
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And also I think once you know the location that a movie is shot at,

403
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and if you know it intimately,

404
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
then you know, you really,

405
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't know.

406
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It loses a lot of the magic for some reason.

407
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And a lot of it was shot at the Pulitzer Hotel,

408
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
right across my office on the canal.

409
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I've stayed there a couple of times myself.

410
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's the hotel with the ceilings that are too low

411
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and the struts, the beams that you keep banging your shoulder into.

412
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So that was, you know,

413
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and then also heard in the Jumpcut promo,

414
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'll talk about copy protection.

415
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I was planning today.

416
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And I was, you know, I'd done all my homework.

417
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I wanted to play a couple of these CDs that Harvey leads it give me from Sony music to play

418
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
or from Epic actually.

419
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And one of the missozi su, which he was crazy about.

420
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So I slipped it into my,

421
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
into my Mac, you know, obviously,

422
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
to create an MP3 or an AAC or whatever to play on the show.

423
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And guess what?

424
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's copy protected.

425
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You can't play it.

426
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I tried it on my windows machine copy protected.

427
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You can't play it on either of these machines.

428
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So I'm like, well,

429
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
you know, what am I going to do now?

430
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I don't have, I'm going to have a regular CD player anymore.

431
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yet somewhere downstairs,

432
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
but I'm not going to start stringing cables, you know,

433
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
so that is clearly,

434
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
you know,

435
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
that's all the whole copy protection idea works, I guess.

436
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I mean, if I really wanted to copy it,

437
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
then I just get a cable and, you know,

438
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
put it into the input of my Mac,

439
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and I'm going to be able to record it just fine.

440
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But I'm not going to go through all that trouble.

441
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I just shoot.

442
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I just wanted to listen to CD just to sample it.

443
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I can't even copy it legally into my iTunes.

444
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So such a shame.

445
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And it was funny.

446
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
There's this, I have a DVD with like a 10,

447
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
10, 12 minute.

448
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Piece of video that we cut to show to different people,

449
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
you know, what podcasting's about.

450
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's really, it's a, I'm pretty proud of it.

451
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's very well done.

452
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Katya actually edited that Katya,

453
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
who did our Adams family reality show.

454
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And we burned it onto a DVD,

455
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
you know, so that you can basically play it from laptop,

456
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
or, you know,

457
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
lots of people have DVD players in their conference room these days.

458
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And at, at Epic,

459
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
they have a beautiful conference room,

460
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
you know, just like the, you know,

461
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
the really nice shiny wood and the leather chairs,

462
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and the huge screen, of course,

463
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
all this Sony gear.

464
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And we put it into the DVD player.

465
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And it went,

466
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
cannot play wrong region.

467
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So here's something I didn't know.

468
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Even if you burn a CD on your European base laptop,

469
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
you will not be able to play that DVD,

470
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
even though it's your own content.

471
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You won't be able to play that DVD on a different player

472
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
in a different region.

473
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You know how it's split up, right?

474
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That's like if you get a DVD from the state,

475
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
so you put it into your laptop,

476
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
it'll say,

477
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
you know,

478
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
this is region one,

479
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I think it is.

480
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And you're currently on region two,

481
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
which is for Europe.

482
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I think those are the right codes.

483
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know if it's one or two or whatever.

484
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And you have like five chances to change that.

485
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And you know,

486
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and each time you change it,

487
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
it drops down one,

488
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
then after those five are up,

489
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I guess you're stuck in the region that you're in,

490
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
you know,

491
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and you can't play DVD from any other region,

492
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
which is just,

493

708
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,160
mashup done by Ed Hago Pian. I think I hope I pronounce it that right. Here's a

709
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,960
email. He says, you've reached out and converted another soul and you're

710
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,720
quest to smite the shit out of that relic we call classic radio and to

711
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,040
break the ice I bring an offering of a mashup I did an able to live in an

712
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,640
hour and effort to find two unlikely bed fellows that actually might work

713
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,080
together. No one else other than my closest friend of her this so it was the

714
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,880
most intimate gift I could think of for a complete stranger. Thank you very much Ed

715
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,720
and just know that you're amongst friends here and keep them

716
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,800
coming. That's that able to live stuff is good. I actually I learned some

717
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,280
stuff about this program called Reason Have You Ever seen That Man That's an

718
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,320
awesome awesome it's a sequencing program but you can you can do mixes with it

719
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,400
and it's not a really appropriate for recording podcasts but I also saw

720
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,240
someone actually operated and it's just blown away by the stuff that you

721
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,600
can do with these types of programs. Yes my friends it's a whole new world of

722
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,440
audio. Do you think Ann Colter's an idiot Rush Limbaugh's a hypocrite

723
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,040
George Bush's evil and perhaps stupid. Republicans are running a mock. The

724
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,720
rich should not own the government lock stock and barrel. The environments

725
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,840
actually worth protecting in this country should have this thing called the

726
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,920
democracy and not be run by a theocracy of right wing radicals. If so come

727
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,840
on over to lowlife.com that's L-O-L-I-F-E.com. Listen to my podcast, check out my

728
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,840

734
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,840

737
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,040

741
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Ah, you know what? I have missed. I have really missed. I have missed the test.

742
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
Yeah.

743
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Hey, y'all, come on in.

744
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Honey, Adam, I haven't got any idea where you're right now.

745
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,040
At the cottage or when you're gonna play to hit this but today.

746
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,040
There's one for you and we're gonna start right away. This is number one.

747
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Alright, kick it.

748
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Uh, don't waste my time.

749
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
No. Is it don't waste my time?

750
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,840
Okay, I know you're sitting there yelling at your iPod, and this is number two

751
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,840
That's uh, SOS fan

752
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,600
You are in my system, you're in my system. I like that. You

753
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
I'm talking number three

754
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:57,840
Yeah, I'm kind of recognizing the bass line, but not doing too well today. I'm afraid young and times up and these are the answers

755
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Number one

756
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:07,760
It's Karen white and the way you love me. Oh, yeah, I was close

757
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,240
All right, number two

758
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,680
Karen white and to number one in today's hit test and this is enter number two

759
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,960
That's the best right loose ends. Oh, and this is hanging on a string. Oh, she's this

760
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,640
I should have got this

761
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Yeah

762
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Yeah, you got me hanging on the street now

763
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,120
I guess I can give myself a boing for sucking

764
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,120
Hang in on a string answer number two

765
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,120
And this is answer number three

766
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,600
It's the right of Michael Walden. This is divine emotions. I never would have guessed that one

767
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
I think I've ever heard this before

768
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
It

769
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
Man this brings back memories

770
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,280
Not for me, but way back when I used to do a dance show on the radio

771
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
This was all music. I used to play

772
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,520
Because it was all a UK and US imports

773
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,960
Okay, there's a long time ago

774
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,320
Well, that's it for a hit test number 33 with whose counting

775
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,360
I am as always feedback is welcome and hit test at gmail.com

You can find information about the hit test and hit test podcast at the ampulet.nl

777
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,280
That's J-A-N-B-O-L-E-T-D-T-N-L

778
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,360
All right, yeah, but I don't have a safe trip you and see you next time for the next edition of the hit test

779
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:52,240
All right, buddy. Thank you very much. I'm glad everybody with the hit test number 33 is already made 33 of those and we've never even met

780
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,600
The live from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This is electronic entertainment bringing you the best of space music

781
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:35,360
You know, I'm not really one for house music and

782
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,360
Techno and stuff like that, but I did check out this space music.nl this podcast and it's really cool

783
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,520
It's kind of trippy. It was the kind of thing that you can put on the Sunday morning and a particularly with the like they have soundscapes and

784
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:56,160
Their version of sound seeing yet. It's not bad. I kind of like it and man. There's just so much

785
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,040
There's so many podcasts so many diverse creative ideas that are out there. I'm just

786
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:07,280
Lated with everything that's coming in on a daily basis trying to keep up with the the workload on the ipodder.org

787
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,520
Just all of the the new shows that have to be categorized and put into spots and the

788
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:18,160
The no-dead editors are doing great great work on that and we all should be pretty happy that we've now crossed that

789
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,640
5,000 podcast milestone. It's absolutely awesome

790
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:29,520
Okay, so that puts us at 42 minutes for today's source code. We're gonna wrap it up. Of course, I'll be back tomorrow

791
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,400
As I said with a sound seeing tour with the new setup

792
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,240
Which now is actually become kind of affordable. You know, I think you can get an i-river 799 for somewhere around

793
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,680
Was it 65 or 70 bucks and then this microphone for under $100?

794
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,000
You could be done and you could be rolling with your very own sound seeing tour setup. I love this stuff

795
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
