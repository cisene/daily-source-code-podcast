00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Daily source code February 8th 2005.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,640
Transmeters? We don't need no stinking transmeters.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,680
Autastic! It's Adam Curry.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,600
Hey everybody, how you doing? It's Tuesday, February 8th.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,800
The power of the door.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,680
Once again, coming you from Curry Cottage, it is the Daily Source Code.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,840
Well man, I've got some stuff lined up for you today.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,560
I could not be happier about a couple of bits of news that I received today through email.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,360
Time here in the UK and Gulford is 1224.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,080
Once again, I'm back in the big green oversized ugly chair.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,560
I've got everything all set up.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:51,880
I actually have my second mic standing my just in case Patricia decides to come in and give me some shit about yesterday's hit test on.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,240
Man! Thank you very much for all the great emails that I've received about not even recognizing one of my wife's biggest hit

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:07,560
songs. I figured out what the problem is right away. It was 1981 and I was either in between doing pirate radio broadcasts

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,840
or I think I might have been in college for that lost semester in West Virginia.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,120
Okay, coming up today we have some technology stuff to talk about about iPodder and about

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:31,960
a podcast recording tool, have some pod save music and also some not so pod save music.

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:40,040
Why you might wonder why why well it was brought to my attention today and then I'm so excited about this.

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,360
Oops. That was me bringing up Firefox. It was brought to my attention today

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:56,840
that ASCAP which of course is the American Society of Composer's author and publishers have

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:09,400
put out a license for podcasts. Yes, this is apparently was effective as of January 1st. I'm not sure when this

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,560
license agreement came out. Of course, a link to the license agreement you can find in the

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,120
show notes for today. I'm going to read you a couple of parts of this because I'm just so excited to see

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,640
a word that didn't even exist barely half a year ago. Now show up in legal documents and

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,280
good legal documents, not the kind that say we're suing your ass. Here it is. The ASCAP

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,080
experimental license agreement for internet sites and services released 5.0 was designed for sites and

27
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,360
services that perform ASCAP music in a non interactive manner. What does that mean? You might ask.

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Well, non interactive means that users cannot select individual songs or posted songs,

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,600
song collections unless the performance is not more than 60 seconds in duration. So first of all,

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,360
if you play anything for instance, young poet with his with his hit test would be less than 60 seconds.

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,680
Although I think the answer sometimes it goes a little bit longer than that. But he would not have to

32
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,840
pay a license. Okay, almost second. I'm going to have to sit with my T here because we're going to

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,920
talk about this for just a couple of minutes. This is exciting shit. Okay, examples of non interactive

34
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:25,480
music, that music uses that qualify for release 5.0 include. Here comes music that is embedded

35
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,960
on one or more pages of a site or service such as a flash intro. Okay, that makes sense. By the way,

36
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,320
you know, if you have a podcast and you're using an opening theme song like you just heard my

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,520
rock money enough. Now, rock money enough. I don't think I think the copyright is pretty much

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,080
inspired on the rock money enough. But it's a remix, right? So someone else performs a music and

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,560
if they're an ask cap member, they deserve to get paid for it. Second, webcasts of live performances

40
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,240
and here comes. Here's the one. Radio broadcasts or podcasts. Now, they hi-finated podcast. I'm

41
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,280
not quite sure why, but I'll just read that again. Radio broadcasts or podcasts that do not

42
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,440
offer a playlist program guide and do not make advanced lists of the songs contained in the programs

43
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:19,000
available prior to their transmission. And finally, song samples are excerpts that are not

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,800
more than 60 seconds in duration. So if I reread this one piece, okay? Radio broadcasts or podcasts.

45
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:33,400
I love seeing this show up on the ask cap site that do not offer a playlist program guide and do

46
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,600
not make advanced lists of the songs contained in the programs available prior to their

47
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:46,680
transmission. So I think what that means is show notes can't contain the title or any

48
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,880
information about the ask cap song, which is kind of makes it, I understand what they're doing

49
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,840
this. So I guess you can't search it and then apparently pull out that one particular piece of music,

50
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,600
would be quite an interesting technological feat actually if you could do that with a podcast.

51
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,920
I think, yeah, I guess technically it is possible if you had the time codes and everything you

52
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,000
might be able to suck it out, but that's I think that's kind of a technicality, but okay,

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,520
so that means you would not be able to list the songs in your show notes. And of course,

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,920
you have to pay some money. Now, this is where it broke down for me because I immediately was like,

55
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,280
whoa, give me the license. Let me see what's going on. I downloaded the non-interactive 5.0

56
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:33,480
license agreement. Hello lawyers. I know that you listened to the show. I've received many

57
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,720
an email from you and had conversations. Some of you, my friends, some of you aren't. Some of you

58
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,360
were my friends before you lit a gate on the other side. We need some help from lawyer. Hold on,

59
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,240
what's that? That's the neighbor. What is he doing? Is he sharpening his throwing knives?

60
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,640
Hmm, lawyers. Yes, I know that lawyers listen to the daily source code. Please help me out,

61
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,480
help me understand what this license is. As far as I can tell, if you have no revenue on your show,

62
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,160
that means you have no sponsoring or advertising, no money coming in based upon the show,

63
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,760
you pay $250 a year and that's it. You can play any ASCAP license music on your podcast.

64
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,840
If you do make money, then you have to pay a percentage of revenue and that's where we've got

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,520
really complicated. They have like three different schedules and examples and my eyes fucking glazed over

66
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,080
when I saw that shit. So they're far from understanding what we need as podcasts, which is just a

67
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,240
fairly simple license. If you're a lawyer, please, I really, I would appreciate so much if you could

68
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,800
look through this document. Again, it's linked from the show notes. I think it is legal actually

69
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,520
to point to the license from your show notes and see if you can figure it out. What does it mean?

70
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:58,120
What exactly do we have to do? And I'll say right off the bat that I think I saw like 15% so if I

71
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,640
understand just in general terms, if I say I make $100 a month in advertising on my podcast,

72
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,000
I would have to pay $15 to ASCAP if I played music. Now the question is, if I just have an opening

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,040
tune, which presumably would be more than 60 seconds, of course, that's your way out, right?

74
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,200
If you do it list less than 60 seconds. Or if you play maybe one song of the day,

75
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,800
do you still have to pay the full amount? I mean, the scheduling, as they call it, the schedule

76
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,000
of how you pay for this performance ride is just fucking complicated, you know, and I'm not a lawyer

77
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,600
and I plead all lawyers who are listening, please help us out. And as easily as possible,

78
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,320
please record this in MP3, send it to MP3feedback at gmail.com. So we can all understand and we can do

79
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,160
this in a fair and safe manner because wow, you know, I'm not looking forward to playing Britney Spears

80
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,720
or anything like that, but I totally would love to share some memories of old tunes with you guys.

81
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,080
And I know that you would love to do it as well. And I think it would be really, really good for

82
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,040
podcasting. It would be great for artists who have big back catalogs who are selling them

83
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
through their own website, for instance. It could just be really, really good for the music industry in general.

84
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,360
And, you know, the terms are, of course, debatable, but the fact that it's shown up now,

85
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:24,040
hold on. Oh, yes. The fact that it's shown up as, as podcasts on a license just is such

86
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,000
such good news. I'm incredibly happy about this. So today I'm going to be playing a couple of

87
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,320
what we would deem non-pod-safe tunes. And I'm just going to think that it won't be a problem

88
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,600
for me to, you know, add this on to whatever payment I'm going to make. Because of course, I'm

89
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,480
going to pay the $250, right? So as of today, I'll just consider myself licensed,

90
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,960
licensed, armed, and licensed is what I think. And it's good because I was talking the past two shows

91
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,040
I've been talking about Michael Jackson and how I believe that he's being framed in this particular

92
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:07,640
case. I've met this man a couple of times. He comes across this very polite, although freaky individual,

93
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,000
but, you know, what's normal? I'm normal sitting here, smoking, drinking, yapping into a microphone.

94
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,480
And it's just whatever you consider normal. But I think he's totally being framed and what's worse.

95
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,840
What's much worse is that we're completely forgetting about the musical profit that Michael Jackson

96
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:32,120
is. He said something really interesting on that Haraldo interview on Fox News. He said,

97
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,400
I think Haraldo said, well, you know, these days it's hip hop, it's rap, it's, you know, there's all kinds

98
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,600
of different musical styles. And you're still kind of what Haraldo was basically saying he was

99
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,120
being nice about it. He was saying, you're kind of still stuck in the 80s and 90s, Michael.

100
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,560
You know, you haven't really upgraded your sound or whatever. And Michael said,

101
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,880
you know, Haraldo, cultural change, style will change, fashion will change, but music stays the same.

102
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,720
The songs always remain. And that's kind of the theme of today's podcast, but I also want to

103
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,360
make sure that we don't forget the musical genius that Michael Jackson is. So let's kick it off

104
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,440
today with Don't Stop till you get enough. This is your daily source code for February 8, 2005.

105
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,680
You ready? Crank it off.

Good luck tonight.

176
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Hey.

177
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Hey, Adam.

178
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
It's Richard Land全warchorid.com

179
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,440
I'd like to point your listeners on something real special,

180
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
On February 15t.

181
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Then it will be possible to listen to you in real life

182
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,440
on the topic of nero costing and also in storage media.

183
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
But I think the nero costing part

184
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,640
part in combination with podcasting can be quite interesting. As far as I know, the first

185
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,800
opportunity for weeks or even months that people can see you live and there's something

186
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,800
interesting as well. The conference is for free. So I'll suggest your podcast listeners to

187
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,800
sign on and there's this special website which can be found on November in the

188
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:07,720
Mike-congress.nl. That's November in your Mike-congress.nl. And I think it's quite

189
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,640
interesting conference and I suggest the podcast listeners who live in the

190
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,280
Netherlands Belgium or maybe even Germany can join this conference on February to

191
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,920
15th and the location is called Happy Days. And what I did see but I'm sure that's

192
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,280
just a coincidence that the founding partner is Grandmasterview. You see you on the 15th

193
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,440
I will be speaking there as well and I will speak about business models for podcasting and stuff

194
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,440
like that.

195
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Richard that was created completely with Nick's cast live. Sounds good although it's just looking at the

196
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,200
meters here at my output meters. Looks like the left channel was a little bit lower than the

197
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,720
right channel. I don't know if that's a problem with Nick's cast live or not. You can hear that

198
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,880
Richard had all these little bits mapped keys and he was firing him off and the sound actually

199
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,400
was really good. I don't know if there's any processing sound in Nick's cast live but it's pretty

200
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,840
impressive. Nick's cast live.com download that sucker. If you're looking for something to create

201
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,600
live podcast with on the fly this is not something you record you used to record and go back and

202
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,560
edit this is for kind of life performance version of the podcast which is the way I do the

203
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:35,080
daily source code. Adam Bloom sent me some tunes. Yes he's related to Ron and I just wanted to

204
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:42,360
share this with you because he's so fucking crazy to hear this version of an ACD C2. Here's Hasing Dixie

205
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,240
on the source code. Oh by the way you're allowed to sing along if you know the words.

206
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Probably the first time you could understand that. I'm not going to plug in your own electric guitar

207
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:05,240
and the jamblers are fast with scenes. She kept motorclaims. She was the best damn woman that I've ever seen

208
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:13,960
she had decided that I still and we no lies out in me out in America that I've eaten more than

209
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:21,480
their share. Had me fat for a year. She told me to come but I was already there. The walls were

210
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:30,120
shaking. Earth was a curtain from mine. We were shaking. We wasn't making it in here. She made

211
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:45,240
all night long. Give me a tear you made. She made all night long. Working double time must have

212
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,520
looks in the light. She didn't want to catch it. She kissed mine all night long. No lies just

213
00:26:52,520 --> 00:27:00,120
a matter of health. Made a meal out of me. Come back for my own. Had to come down to taking

214
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:08,520
movies around. Now I'm back in the rain to take it. Let the swing and the walls was shaking. Earth was

215
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:19,800
a curtain from mine. We were shaking. We wasn't making it in here. She made all night long. I have

216
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:32,760
mercy on the years. She made all night long. You're able to make it in here. She made all night long.

217
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:42,920
Got it now. I'm standing here. She made all night long. Yeah, you should make.

218
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:31,080
You're able to make it in here. You're able to make it in here. You're able to make it in here.

219
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:44,840
You're able to make it in here. You're able to make it in here. You're able to make it in here.

220
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:52,680
Yeah, you should make it in here. You're able to make it in here.

221
00:28:52,680 --> 00:29:01,640
Oh, god, oh. Hey, Adam and all the daily source code listeners. My name's Travis Hoffman

222
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,840
and I'm the proprietor of the Ponderplace podcast. What's the Ponderplace podcast you ask?

223
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,520
It's a place where I take a look into the tales of the odd and moronic found in everyday life.

224
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,080
So exactly. What kind of tales of odd and moronic behavior am I talking about?

225
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,800
Well, there's always like how we just own cheese. How come you never see any metal sports?

226
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,160
How can you get 130% vitamin C in the orange juice? Why do they always hide the Valentine's day

227
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,360
candy and health information underneath the candy? Is it impossible to blow your nose well driving?

228
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,760
Do those blizz greens of death on one nose machine? You'll have to be that annoying.

229
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,800
Is lots of hair pigment threes on old people with their web turned signal on well driving?

230
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,000
Does everything need a four-none date these days? Why do charming compare toilet paper to pillows?

231
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,400
How come in Walmart? There's a mirror for your car that has a rhinoceros in it.

232
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,000
They show on your love by spinning or doing your pets really showing love at all. How exactly do you puff?

233
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,920
Puff rise and pump bleak. The secret service just hasn't blown anyone anymore. It's really not that big of a secret.

234
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,640
I think it'd be funny to put strawberry milk on an empty petal business model and just drink a lot.

235
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,000
How come mallwalkers are so dangerous? I think it'd be funny if that grocery store had sales on can do it.

236
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,880
And then hung up from the ceiling just out of reach two words, nerped car.

237
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,880
How come scientists have kept calcium and sodium yet? Why do you need a careful of your own?

238
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,840
Sorry. I get kind of carried away sometimes.

239
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,240
If you're curious about these pondering and many others, be sure to check out the Ponderplace podcast at www.

241
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Yeah, I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired.

242
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,080
Oh, I'm tired.

243
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,120
Oh, I'm tired.

244
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,400
With your own polo.

245
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,680
I know.

246
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,040
Hi, Adam. Hey, young polo, I take you with a hit test number seven.

247
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,080
Alright, buddy. Again, I've lined up three tracks for you.

248
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,880
I bet you have.

249
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,680
I hope you're ready.

250
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,040
Yes, this is number one.

251
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,800
Don't forget to buy my wife in there, okay?

252
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Oh, Charlie Wattley.

253
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Oh, it's Chalamara, Charlie.

254
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,840
It's, I think it's Charlie Wattley.

255
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,040
I'm looking for new.

256
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,480
Look. Listen to that cow.

257
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Do I hear a cow though?

258
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,640
And this is number two.

259
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,440
Yes, this is a Dutch group.

260
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,880
Frog with your fruit.

261
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,440
Swine bits.

262
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,760
No one else will know that outside of Holland or Portugal.

263
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Your Dutch, you probably guessed it. Big hit.

264
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,040
And the last one. Number three.

265
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,200
Hmm, yeah, I know this one.

266
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
This is uh, Alice and Moier.

267
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,080
Oh, my head. Alice and Moier. It's all sung out.

268
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,240
Oh, cry.

269
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,680
I'll cry it out, I think it is.

270
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
And these are the answers.

271
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,600
And so number one.

272
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,760
It's Charlie Wattley.

273
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
And she's looking for a new love.

274
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,600
I hear a cow though.

275
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,400
I need a cow though.

276
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,320
I'm really, yeah.

277
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,640
Charlie Wattley.

278
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,000
The former singer of Schalemar.

279
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
See, I see a lot of people.

280
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,400
I knew love. This is number two.

281
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,280
We're going extra points.

282
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,320
It's a Dutch track.

283
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,640
Yeah.

284
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,640
It's Frank Weier.

285
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,080
And the song is titled, The Swatch Vits.

286
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,520
I should tell the listeners that this guy married

287
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,640
Amanda Redington.

288
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,880
She's a UK TV presenter and his hero wondering.

289
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,600
It's a nice guy, Frank.

290
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,920
So really good lyric in this.

291
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm not white. I'm not black.

292
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,080
I don't think white. I don't think black.

293
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,160
I think in the color of your heart.

294
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,520
I don't think white.

295
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,760
No, it's Frank Weier.

296
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,720
And Swatch Vits.

297
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,360
Black and white.

298
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,840
Something in line of don't think black.

299
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,640
Don't say white.

300
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,240
But think in the color of your heart.

301
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,280
It's answer number three.

302
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,600
All right.

303
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,360
Allison.

304
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,640
It's Allison Weier.

305
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,800
And she's all cried out.

306
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,520
I'll cry it out.

307
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:31,240
The grass is gone and you'll be

308
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,240
baby.

309
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,560
I'm gonna keep it as I run

310
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,840
and hear the short and the narrow.

311
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,240
I'm not thinking anything.

312
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,760
I'll be yeah.

313
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,640
Also a great lyric to this listeners.

314
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,400
Oh yeah.

315
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,280
You took a whole lot of love and for a handful of nothing.

316
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,840
It's great.

317
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,560
Great young.

318
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,200
Excellent.

319
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,160
Oh my favorite songs.

320
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,360
Man, they made some good music in the A.E.

321
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,800
It's a bad hair.

322
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,560
Crad out with answer number three.

323
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,000
And this hit test.

324
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,080
Number seven already.

325
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,040
It's going fast.

326
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,320
Well, I'm still still working on the air checks.

327
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,720
You can't have too many of those.

328
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,120
Still searching for a piece that I can use in the hit test.

329
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,600
If you've got one, please send it to hittestatgmail.com.

330
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,760
And that's also the address to send your feedback to hittestatgmail.com.

331
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,640
If you want to download this edition of the hittest

332
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:45,320
or earlier episodes, you can find them at www.helpat hands.nl slash hittest.

333
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,920
So that's www.helpat hands.

334
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,560
That's an L slash hittest.

335
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,280
That's it for today.

336
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,080
See you next time for another

337
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,240
edition of the hittest. Bye-bye.

338
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,360
Thank you very much, young.

339
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,160
Excellent.

340
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,240
As always, the hit test.

341
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,040
And I forgot to put the site in there.

342
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Yesterday in the show notes, it's in there today.

343
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,680
Hi Adam.

344
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,640
This is Kevin.

345
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,280
And if my voice sounds a little bit familiar to you,

346
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,600
but you can't quite place it, let me give you a hand.

347
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,720
It's time for Adam Curry to take the hittest.

348
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,440
I'm just one of the fellows that post over at radeogaddy.com.

349
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,440
And I just wanted to drop in and clarify

350
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,360
key things because I've noticed a few people have heard about the site

351
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,880
through you and other places and have come by and made requests

352
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,760
and been a little bit disappointed and not understood why.

353
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,480
And so I thought I might just drop in clarify

354
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,800
key things and help people get a little bit better response perhaps.

355
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,440
I first think to understand is that radeogaddy.com builds itself

356
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
as free voiceovers and more.

357
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,840
The original intent was to help low-power non-profit radio stations.

358
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,200
Exchange voice work so that, you know, if I have a station in the mean guy,

359
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,840
you know, you don't hear my voice all day long.

360
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,400
I'll have other people do voices like I have an Australian fellow

361
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,960
on my little home station that you'll hear.

362
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:18,760
A few clarifications on what things are voiceover talking.

363
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,520
If you ask for a voiceover or a dry read,

364
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,600
you'll probably get that filled pretty quick.

365
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,720
Somebody will just read what you type in and do give them a script.

366
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,320
Tell them what you want.

367
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,840
Just saying drop by my website and check it out and get an idea what I want.

368
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,320
That's not going to get a good response.

369
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,600
So say clearly what it is you're looking for.

370
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,880
And what style?

371
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,040
Upbeat, newsy, mellow, laidback, however you want to phrase it.

372
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,480
Next, a jingle.

373
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,760
Jingle has singing.

374
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,520
We do not do jingles.

375
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,960
You don't want to hear me sing.

376
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,000
That's all there is to that.

377
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,800
A sweeper or a produced element is what a lot of people are asking for.

378
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,880
And I want folks to understand that you have to have the stuff to make those.

379
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,760
And a lot of guys do not.

380
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,440
And you have to have the time to do them.

381
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,360
There's a lot of work involved in that.

382
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,000
So occasionally somebody will find something they think is a challenge.

383
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,600
Like this one I did for a game's podcast.

384
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,080
I'd rather like it and just kind of proud of it and enjoy doing it.

385
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:36,680
We're not talking your dad's video games.

386
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,720
So that's an example of a produced sweeper.

387
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,840
But as I say, not everybody's time to do that.

388
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,720
So if that's not what you get, please don't be disappointed that nobody answered.

389
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,520
Sometimes your post gets knocked down the list and just gets missed.

390
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,840
I hope this explains things a little bit and that folks will drop by and check things out.

391
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,600
And I enjoy doing the stuff for Yon and for you and for the hit test.

392
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,760
And I did not know about your podcast before, but now I'm enjoying listening.

393
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,680
Take care and I'm sure you'll be hearing me often because I don't think Yon and the hit

394
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,280
test are going anywhere anytime soon.

395
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:29,240
So this is Kevin, known over at radiodaddy.com is power FM saying now back to Adam Curry and the

396
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,360
Daily Source Co.

397
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,560
Awesome. Awesome. Thank you very much, Kevin. That's great.

398
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,400
That's clarification because I've been sending people over to radiodaddy.com without really

399
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,520
thinking too much about what the implications of that could be.

400
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,560
And perhaps we need to do something specifically for podcasts for that.

401
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,640
And I'd certainly contribute and you're right, creating sweepers and bumpers and jingles and stuff is hard work.

402
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,840
And usually I wound up paying people significant sums of money to do that for me is a guy in

403
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:04,520
New York, Dave Fox, WX Fox on the run.com is his site and he does, I actually have an exclusive

404
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:11,000
arrangement with him for for Europe when I do stuff on, you know, traditional radio and television.

405
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,280
But if you have a little bit of a cash and you want him to produce some stuff and he has the

406
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,040
time too, he is absolutely the best. But when it comes to a community-based thing like this,

407
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,920
yeah, I'd be happy to, you know, happy to cut some liners. Maybe, well, you know, we should think

408
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,840
about that where we can do if we can come up with some kind of central resource because the idea is

409
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:38,280
great. But, you know, maybe radiodaddy.com should be for a little, you know, for a different audience

410
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,680
than the podcasters. But the clarification was excellent Kevin, I really appreciate. And of course,

411
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,760
I appreciate the sweeper and the bumper for the hit test. As do I appreciate,

412
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,760
young pull-out putting that together every single day, I really appreciate that. Don't forget,

413
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,120
on Thursdays, we have our trivia Thursday, I have, oh man, I have such a big,

414
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,680
yeah, I got a big, you know, I was big. I have this Beatles-based trivia, I've got another

415
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,640
lost in translation trivia, I've got him here, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

416
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,560
five, seven, yeah, seven different trivia to us so far. And of course, there'll be, so let's

417
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,160
make that eight with young pull-outs Thursday edition. All right, almost, well, actually, it's

418
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,400
40 minutes, so I could end it here, but Christine and I were in the car this morning. What I,

419
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,800
when I tend to do is, I got my iPod running overnight and the iPod has plugged in, so, you know,

420
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,520
true to form, I pick up the iPod, jack in the iPrip and on the way to school, which is about a

421
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,640
15 minute drive in the morning, sometimes a little bit longer. Then we listen to whatever's come

422
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:49,560
through, whatever the latest podcasts were. And this morning, we heard this awesome mashup,

423
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,560
which I just wanted to share with you. So, you know, you can end if your walk is over,

424
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,480
if your commute is over, you're at the 40 minute mark, you can save this for later,

425
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,920
or you can listen to it right now, but I guarantee you, I guarantee you're going to want to crank

426
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:08,360
this one out. YouTube versus lyrics more, it's called calling on a Sunday.

427
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,120
And I told every group you go make it all happy night you're right next. I'm on a walk from the other house

428
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:44,040
and who the hell he is. And it's called a joke, I make it to my new meet in. So take your time, grab a take a week, I'll move to see you.

429
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,840
And I will now make you introduce me to my new people, see my name is Leverich's mom, baby, and I truly mean it.

430
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,080
For the past, I'm the future from the new women's and you can't help but leave it, you can read it, pay to it,

431
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,440
and you'll need to live a life, or see it's won't be in this more baby.

432
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,680
I'm a blessing, I'm a girl, see you, and I think, oh, that's time to get your dinner, baby.

433
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,480
I'm never running from a challenge ever, bitchy, bitchy, you know, rap, all the time we got that can't move in.

434
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,280
You have to see me do my best, son, I'm two fingers, play it too, not the two, show the wounded man.

435
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,400
I have a rumor, you may begin to feel the music, your feet may never be true, the music ain't love, be the screamer, baby.

436
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,960
All in a zone, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

437
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,680
Call it up to all, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

438
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,560
Call it up to all, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

439
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,200
Call it up to all, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

440
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,600
My life's a combination of my past achievements,

441
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,560
with a lot of heavy lifting, a lot of teeth breathing, a lot of courage,

442
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,520
a lot of times, a lot of mixed feelings, a lot of love, a lot of love, a lot of love,

443
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,040
you throw a lot of reasons, hang, bring out, I'm about to paint it on the mistreatment,

444
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,680
hang, bring out a little backstage, try the wiggle, me, you, hang,

445
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,520
forgot about the flowers, you underneath the crowded streets, drop in between the crack team,

446
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,560
a chap, hey, hey, fallin' like I like it in the kind of signal,

447
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,960
and you can pass it to my ticket, you're in the Masaliga,

448
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,280
you think I'll never hang head up for money, stop dreaming,

449
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,600
you think I'll never stop, hold baby, now you're richer.

450
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,000
I won't stop till I feel my known stop breathing,

451
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,400
I won't stop till I feel my heart stopped beating,

452
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,800
I won't stop speaking this weekend next weekend,

453
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,040
I won't sleep singing, I don't stop singing,

454
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,960
buy a freeze and I keep the fireball free,

455
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,440
no, man, won't break this from the metal times,

456
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,040
swimming, baby, call it up to all, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

457
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,400
Call it up to all, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

458
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Call it up to all, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

459
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,040
Call it up to all, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

460
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,440
Call it up to all, every group you go make it all happy night you're right next.

461
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,560
Call it on Sunday, it's, uh,

462
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,240
YouTube versus lyrics born at the end of the Tuesday source code.

463
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,480
Alrighty, oh, man, so, uh, 10 after one,
