1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
POT show, you press play, we do the rest.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:35,000
With the share of Charlie, two nine or seven.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a science formula, not too far from me.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know how many years I've done right there.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
One out of all could have seen me.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Made I couldn't cause, like vampire bats different,

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'd have brought you to your city that way.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And you've got a funny way.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm showing off you, bathroom surgeon.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You said you were just cooling down from the bathroom.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There's something I should tell you for me.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Me and I have much time in my life.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've never had a life yours.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Stars at night are big and bright to thin your eyes, music.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't know what's on me as my old grown-up, damn well I did it.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not much of a gesture, but I just poison food for you.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You might just see all your food.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm royalty my king of fame.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's a lot of info in this world.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000

You're at it, it's cool.

You're at it, it's cool.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're at it, it's cool.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:57,800
The Alcaline trio

98
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:05,040
Queen of Pain from the podcast, music, knitwear, musicgrotpodshow.com.

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,720
Michael Buttler today is Potshoe HQ, and he says, do gaboricorzers know

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,120
And so I went looking for it, lo and behold,

101
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Alkaline trio, it's from 2002 and I'm pretty sure

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Christina will even totally love this song.

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,920
She's probably familiar with them.

104
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,720
Again, J.J. Records, lots of independent record labels

105
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,120
are now coming online, coming onto the Pod Safe Music Network,

106
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,120
offering up a selection of artists that they have signed

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
to the label.

108
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,520
This is so cool.

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
This is just beautiful.

110
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I've had a great day.

111
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,120
You have no idea, well, I'm going to tell you

112
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,320
how great my day was.

113
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
I started off very early.

114
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,920
We started right now with this morning at 8 o'clock.

115
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,920
And oh, man, I got some cool stuff for you.

116
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,320
Even though I got to say my stomach's a little bit upset,

117
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,520
I know if that was, it's probably from the flight,

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
or I don't know.

119
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,720
What did I have for, after I think what I had,

120
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,520
I had a croc mushy, a cock, mushy, cock,

121
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,120
cock, cock, cock, cock, cock mushy.

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
They was the bean soup.

123
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120
I could have been it.

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,920
But my stomach's a little bit upset.

125
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,520
But otherwise, at a great day, we just have all kinds

126
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
of fantastic meetings.

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,520
We're getting so close to really start to unleash

128
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,120
some things.

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,320
It's almost not funny.

130
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,720
And I had another long chat with the Chris Rockwell,

131
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,720
better known as Mr. Poop Caster, who is leading

132
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,320
development in the podcast, music network.

133
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,720
And yeah, I really do think that we're going to have

134
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
our purchasing.

135
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,520
He says by Christmas, so I'll give him until the new years

136
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,720
before I start bitching and moaning.

137
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,720
But that means that you'll be able to, as a podcaster,

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,920
of course, to still be able to play songs in the podcast,

139
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
music network, you put your link in your show notes,

140
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
you report back into the network.

141
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,720
And your listeners will then be able to follow the link

142
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,320
from your show notes, go straight to the artist's page,

143
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,720
and then actually purchase the track on a track by

144
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,520
track basis.

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
And the purchasing, I'm not going to tell you anything

146
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,320
right now, but I'm really excited if we can get together

147
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,920
what we discussed today.

148
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,720
That's going to be awesome.

149
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
And what's that?

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
40 tracks went up today.

151
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,720
It's just unbelievable.

152
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,920
If you want to know more, go do music.podshow.com.

153
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
And if you need help or have any questions,

154
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,120
give Michael Butler a ping.

155
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,520
He is the original Rock and Old Geek from Rock and Old Geek

156
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,720
podcast at Rock and Old Geek.com.

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,520
So have had a major Gmail problem

158
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,720
for the past shoot.

159
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm going to say more than 30 minutes.

160
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,220
I keep getting server error.

161
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,320
Gmail is temporarily unavailable.

162
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,520
And here comes, cross your fingers and try

163
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,320
getting a few minutes.

164
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,720
We're sorry for the inconvenience.

165
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,320
That's a typical, that's Google culture for you right there.

166
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,720
No, I'm refreshing.

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,420
I'm going to Gmail again.

168
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,720
And I still get the error, which is a real bummer

169
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,720
because I've become so dependent upon Gmail.

170
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,320
Not just for the regular email stuff,

171
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,520
but I have a whole system set up with rules and filters.

172
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
And if I forward something from the Blackberry

173
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,320
with a certain code in it, I can tell you

174
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,120
because it only works from my Blackberry's address.

175
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,120
I put in DSC in the subject and then I just

176
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,320
forward it and it gets put into a special folder.

177
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Actually, a label is what they call it.

178
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,520
And then I just want to prepping the show.

179
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
I just go through the entire list and I got all my stuff.

180
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
So I've been diligently forwarding things into my Gmail.

181
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,120
And there you go.

182
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Gmail has screwed up my podcast today and try one more time.

183
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,320
See if we can get anything going here.

184
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,920
Hold on.

185
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Let me see.

186
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,320
Let me see.

187
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,920
I can go to Google itself.

188
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Let's see if all of Google is down.

189
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,120
Oh, man.

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Hey, if you're listening to this podcast on serious satellite radio

191
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
stars, 103, welcome everybody.

192
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
This is a podcast.

193
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,720
And you're going to hear probably most of it.

194
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,120
If we go over the a lot of satellite window past our time,

195
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
of course, that means that Pacific Coast Hellway will be coming in.

196
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,720
You'd have to download the podcast to listen to the rest.

197
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,920
OK, so Google works.

198
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,120
Now let me try Gmail again.

199
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Loading.

200
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,520
It's contacting.

201
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
It's waiting.

202
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
It still says loading.

203
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
God, this sucks.

204
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Man.

205
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Oh, this pisses me off.

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
OK, well, waiting for that to load.

207
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I want to tell you that there's a new podcast for one-one podcast

208
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,520
that's a Rob from podcast for one-one.

209
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,720
He's kind of the, it's really like the, he talks to people

210
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
the people behind the podcast.

211
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,120
Shit.

212
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
No, it's still broken.

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,920
Goddamn.

214
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,120
Temporarily unavailable.

215
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
I am crossing my fingers.

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,720
I'm standing on one foot.

217
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,920
I'm praising Murphy.

218
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,320
All that good stuff.

219
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,520
So you can find podcast for one-one podcast for one-one.com.

220
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,720
And as promised, Rob interviewed Madge Weinstein on the podcast.

221
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,120
And you definitely want to check that out.

222
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,520
Particularly because Madge is celebrating her one-year anniversary.

223
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,920
I think the one-year anniversary show was yesterday, or was it, yeah, it was yesterday.

224
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,620
And it's cool to listen to this pioneer of podcasting and get to know a little bit

225
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,120
more about everybody's favorite, bloated Jewish, extremely angry lesbian.

226
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,520
And I'll tell you what.

227
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Let me get it.

228
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I can't, I can't stand it anymore.

229
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,920
OK, I have something to show you guys.

230
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,120
As you know, those of you who are unfamiliar with this podcast or just start just tuning

231
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,120
into podcast now, we have something we call sound seeing, a sound seeing tour.

232
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,520
So let me just say that again, because people often don't hear it right.

233
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,920
Sound seeing tour.

234
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,520
So what we're going to do is we're going to take a little trip.

235
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,920
I got my mobile microphone.

236
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,120
I have a wireless microphone set up.

237
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,840
And I connect that to my I-River, I-F-P-799, and with that I can record virtually anything

238
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
anywhere I go.

239
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm really happy with the sound quality of this thing.

240
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,240
And so if you have an opportunity, you might even want to close your eyes because all

241
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,840
of the ambient sound is really going to add to the experience.

242
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,600
I want to take you on a little sound seeing tour because I have something to show you

243
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
that I'm very, very excited about.

244
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,440
Something to be talking about for many, many months here on the daily source code.

245
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
Have you figured it out yet?

246
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
OK, hold on.

247
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Let me just switch mics.

248
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
OK, let me turn this on.

249
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Hold on a second.

250
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Let me see if I get this.

251
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Here we go.

252
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Oh, I am so excited when I'm going to demonstrate to you.

253
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,840
OK, hold on a second.

254
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Right, I got my code on.

255
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,840
We're going to, the sound seeing tour is a very specific one.

256
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,840
It's something that I've been wanting to share with you for a long, long time.

257
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Just get my keys here for a second.

258
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,840
We're going to go on a little trip.

259
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,840
We've never actually done any sound seeing in the condo.

260
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
How are we?

261
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Yeah.

262
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,840
OK, let me just make sure I got everything here.

263
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
I want to take my digital camera.

264
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
We're going to need that.

265
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Let me just make sure what is this set to.

266
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Portrait.

267
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Now we don't want portrait.

268
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,840
We want scenery now.

269
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
The hell though I want here.

270
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,840
All these different things on my camera.

271
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Night scene, night scene.

272
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Why don't we do night scene?

273
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
No, that won't work.

274
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Are you curious to know what we're going to take a look at now, aren't you?

275
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,840
OK, let me set this to, I'll just set it to Portrait.

276
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
That should work.

277
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Right, turn that off for now.

278
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
OK, let me see.

279
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Just double check, double check of the keys.

280
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
You know, living by myself here in the condo.

281
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Pretty damn important.

282
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
So make sure that you got your keys with you.

283
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
All right, let's go.

284
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Hold on.

285
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Ah, some trash.

286
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm going to take care of that first.

287
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,840
There we go.

288
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Right.

289
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Now hopefully, won't meet anyone on the way down.

290
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Because of course, I'll feel like a total idiot talking to myself as usual.

291
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Let's just go to the trash shoe here.

292
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Hello.

293
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Coming down at you.

294
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
24 floors.

295
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
OK.

296
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Let's, uh, I'm never actually taking the elevator to where we're going today.

297
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Oh boy, that was fast.

298
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
OK.

299
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Now, let's go.

300
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Great.

301
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
No one in the elevator.

302
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Perfect.

303
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Let's go down to that one.

304
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,840
So we're going down to P4.

305
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,840
The, uh, the elevator I'm in is actually set for, uh,

306
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
for, uh, for a move.

307
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Somebody's moved day.

308
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
It's got the, you can hear the dull sound.

309
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Oops.

310
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Someone says coming in.

311
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Hold on.

312
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Let's stop here at 60.

313
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Good evening.

314
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Good evening.

315
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Good night.

316
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,840
OK.

317
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Sorry about the radio silence there for a second,

318
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
but I didn't, I forgot.

319
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
I didn't have my cell phone with me.

320
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
So I couldn't pretend that I was talking, uh,

321
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I was going to actually reach my pocket.

322
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,840
I was going to pull it out and start talking.

323
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,840
But, uh, realize I didn't take my phone with me

324
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
because it really interferes with the, the I River,

325
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
which I'm using to record.

326
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
OK.

327
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
We are here at P4.

328
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Let me start telling you about, uh, the story.

329
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
P4, of course, is for parking.

330
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
So yesterday, I told you about,

331
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,840
ah, excuse me, since say I only wish.

332
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,840
I told you about this, uh, car that I saw.

333
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Parked right near our brand new office.

334
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,840
And, uh, that I put a note underneath the, uh,

335
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
windshield wipers saying,

336
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
will you sell me this car?

337
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,840
And today I got a call, uh, this morning from Isabelle.

338
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
And she said, uh, Adam, I said, yeah,

339
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,840
she said, well, you left this note on my car.

340
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,840
I just want you to know that I've actually had it up on Craigslist

341
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
for a couple of weeks.

342
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Um, and, uh, yeah, it's for sale.

343
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
And ladies and gentlemen,

344
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,840
I present you with Trinity.

345
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
That's me kicking the rear bumper.

346
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
This is without a doubt.

347
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Exactly. This, this car was meant for me.

348
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,840
It was, it was built for me to purchase.

349
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Um, it is a, what color is this?

350
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,840
I'd have to say it's kind of like, um,

351
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,840
like a really old banana yellow color.

352
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,840
And, um, someone else in the garage.

353
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,840
It's a Mercedes turbo diesel 300.

354
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Actually, it's a 300 TD.

355
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
I'm just getting the key here.

356
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,840
And it has a bio diesel sticker on the back.

357
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm going to go to the front here.

358
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,840
It is without a doubt.

359
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Let me just get in the car.

360
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
It is without a doubt.

361
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
The ugliest.

362
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,840
The ugliest car I've ever seen in my entire life.

363
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Uh, so I'm in, I'm sitting in the driver seat right now.

364
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,840
There's, um, it's a little, uh, crack here on the windshield

365
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
down, uh, almost in the middle.

366
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Another star here on the left of the windshield

367
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
where, uh, stones have clearly hit it.

368
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,840
So, uh, I get the call from, uh, is a bell.

369
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
And, uh, she, uh, lives in the neighborhood,

370
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
or she's staying in the neighborhood.

371
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
It doesn't really live anywhere right now.

372
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,840
She said, and as she had purchased this car,

373
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
which, by the way, has a name.

374
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
The car's name is Trinity.

375
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,840
And it's a she, uh, and that's been explained to me,

376
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,840
um, is a bell who, who sold me the car,

377
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,840
is a yoga teacher.

378
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,840
And, uh, definitely, um,

379
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,840
uh, she was just like a young, cute hippie chick.

380
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
But she purchased a Trinity with a girlfriend of hers

381
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
who then, uh, bowed out of the deal

382
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
and so she really couldn't afford to keep it herself.

383
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,840
She bought it for, I think she paid $6,000 for it.

384
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
She was asking for $7,000.

385
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Of course, I said, uh, yeah, I'll pay you five.

386
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Uh, and we wound up kind of, uh, in the middle there.

387
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,840
And, uh, and it is already completely outfitted

388
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,840
with a biodiesel engine,

389
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
or with the biodiesel conversion on the engine.

390
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Now, it's a turbo diesel.

391
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,840
And this thing, uh, currently,

392
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:23,840
as of today, rides on 99.9% vegetable oil.

393
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,840
It is a, I mean, this is not a blended thing.

394
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Um, she usually fills it up in Berkeley

395
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
at the Berkeley biodiesel gas station,

396
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
which, of course, will be a sound seeing tour

397
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
for this week.

398
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
You know, we're going to go over there and fill up.

399
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Um, and it, and it runs like a charm.

400
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,840
It's, it's just the most unbelievable experience.

401
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
I've already, of course, driven it around town

402
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
with a little bit from office to office.

403
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
It's, uh, manual.

404
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,840
It has a wonderful, um, uh, radio and CD player in it.

405
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
And that's about all the luxury you're going to get.

406
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,840
I still haven't exactly figured out how to get the seat to go down.

407
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
I don't know if it, the seat can go down.

408
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
I got to go back and I've got it.

409
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Everything tilted.

410
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Uh, let me just see where the, uh,

411
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,840
I'm going to open up the, I want to open up the,

412
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
the bonnet.

413
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
That's what we all saw.

414
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Let me just check here.

415
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
This, uh, hmm.

416
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Where is that thing?

417
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
It's got to be around here somewhere.

418
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Hmm.

419
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Well, B, maybe it's in the glove box.

420
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Oh, shoot.

421
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Now I got to see if I can, well,

422
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
maybe, uh, there's no inside class.

423
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Here's what I'm going to do.

424
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
I'm going to start rough.

425
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Just so you can listen to the engine.

426
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Now you have to let the coils pre-heat first.

427
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Uh, otherwise you can burn those out.

428
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Okay.

429
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
It's done.

430
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
So let's crank her up.

431
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Listen to that puppy per hour.

432
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Come on.

433
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
Let's go look at the engine.

434
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Wait.

435
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
I'll take my camera.

436
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
It's going to take some pictures of.

437
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Alright.

438
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,840
I think there's, uh,

439
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,840
somewhere there's a thing here to open up the,

440
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
good.

441
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
There we go.

442
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Pull that out.

443
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Isn't that it?

444
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,840
It should be it.

445
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Damn.

446
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,840
It opened perfectly this morning.

447
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Oh, let me do that in a second.

448
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Hold on.

449
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
You just take the picture of it.

450
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,840
So you get a perfect view.

451
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Okay.

452
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
That's, uh, front view.

453
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
I can't really do it.

454
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
I can try and do a side view.

455
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,840
There's another part, part next to it.

456
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Okay.

457
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm going to take that picture.

458
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Right.

459
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Now let me take a picture of the back.

460
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
You hear?

461
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
This is running like a charm.

462
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Just beautiful.

463
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Okay.

464
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Shot of the back here.

465
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
And, uh,

466
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
Oops.

467
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
You just got a lighter shot there.

468
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Beautiful.

469
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
The back seat.

470
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
It actually has a reverse seat in the back,

471
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,840
which I think I explained, uh,

472
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,840
on the show yesterday.

473
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
So you, uh, literally can see six people in this.

474
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,840
I'm going to take it to the office tomorrow because, uh,

475
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
I'm moving in.

476
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,840
It's a perfect automobile to move shit with.

477
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,840
Now let me find the, oh, here it is.

478
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,840
That's, that's the.

479
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,840
The release for the bonnet.

480
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Okay.

481
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Now let me get the little thing here.

482
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Hop.

483
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
Ah, there she goes.

484
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Listen to that engine per, huh?

485
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Okay.

486
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
I'm going to take a picture of the, uh,

487
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
the biodiesel conversion.

488
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Which is basically a filter,

489
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
and a bunch of tubes.

490
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
And I'll take a shot of the entire engine.

491
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Which looks kind of like a junkyard.

492
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Ha ha.

493
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Hold on.

494
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
There we go.

495
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Boom.

496
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Perfect.

497
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Got it.

498
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
So you can hear.

499
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
And it is a turbo diesel.

500
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
So let me, uh, rev up the engine.

501
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
We can listen to our wine.

502
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Hold on.

503
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Listen to this.

504
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
You can still listen to that.

505
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
One, two, three.

506
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
And it's still on this.

507
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,840
One, two, three, four, five.

508
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Now I can't be five, seven, this.

509
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,840
One, two, three, four, five.

510
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Huh?

511
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Well that's interesting.

512
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Maybe you don't want to have five series.

513
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Or only.

514
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I mean, it's four plus one.

515
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Brand new battery.

516
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
All right, listen to this.

517
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Listen to that engine.

518
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Maybe listen to that.

519
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
You can hear the turbo.

520
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Listen to that.

521
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Ah, so sweet.

522
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Okay.

523
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Drop the boner again.

524
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
So.

525
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Oh man, the smell was perfect.

526
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
You can.

527
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
Ha ha.

528
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Let's see.

529
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
There's a radio in here.

530
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Oh.

531
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Oh man.

532
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
The smell was perfect.

533
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Ha ha ha.

534
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's see.

535
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
There's a radio in here.

536
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Oh man.

537
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
Oh man.

538
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Let's see.

539
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
There's a radio in here.

540
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
But I don't think the.

541
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Oops.

542
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Fader.

543
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Volume.

544
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
Source.

545
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
CD.

546
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
I don't think there's a CD in there.

547
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
FM.

548
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Now we're done in the bottom of the garage.

549
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
So this is also a power.

550
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
What if I hold that?

551
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
We'll return it off.

552
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
If I just hold that down.

553
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Yeah.

554
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Perfect.

555
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Okay.

556
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
So.

557
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
This is it.

558
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
This is Trinity.

559
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
This is going to be my experiment.

560
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
While in San Francisco.

561
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,840
This is supposed to be a daily source code listener participation project.

562
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Okay.

563
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,840
If you live in the Bay area and you're inclined to help out with this project.

564
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
I'm looking for people to help me with two things.

565
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
One.

566
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
We've got to clean this puppy out.

567
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
We've got to paint it.

568
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
We've got to you know.

569
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
We've got to pimp this bitch out.

570
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
That's what we've got to do.

571
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Oh, it's I'm just looking at the.

572
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,840
At the Odom and 145,253 miles on the block.

573
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Wow.

574
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
But speaking of clock.

575
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,840
It's internal clock is right on time.

576
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
I've got a.

577
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
What do I have here?

578
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
I've got.

579
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Shoot.

580
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I should do an interior picture.

581
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
Now shouldn't I?

582
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Hold on.

583
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Let me do that.

584
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
There we go.

585
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
So he's me.

586
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Take my glasses off.

587
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
So I can look a little bit more.

588
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
You mean?

589
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
You see how that turned out?

590
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Oh, cool.

591
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
It looks very good.

592
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
So I'm going to need some help on the artwork.

593
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
I definitely want to turn it into.

594
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
It's almost the perfect.

595
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
It's almost the pod show colors.

596
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,840
So it's a perfect ugly yellow, which we have to turn into kind of like a line green.

597
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Besides that, what I need is I need help in making biodiesel and learning how to do it.

598
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,840
And also I guess just getting into the whole culture.

599
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,840
And I think that when we do our sound seeing tour to the.

600
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,840
Biodiesel gas station in the Berkeley biodiesel place that will probably meet some interesting people over there.

601
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,840
So I'll be sure to.

602
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Oh, there's also a check this out.

603
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
It has a sunroof.

604
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
A completely.

605
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Oh, man.

606
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Completely manual sunroof.

607
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
What was that up?

608
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
This thing is awesome.

609
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,840
It's got everything I ever could dream of in a biodiesel clunker.

610
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
I'm so proud.

611
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
I'm so happy with this thing.

612
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Okay.

613
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Let's, you know, the pipe there.

614
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
And turn it off.

615
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Good.

616
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Alrighty.

617
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,840
So make sure that you go to daily source.

618
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Lock this.

619
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Make sure you go to daily source code dot com.

620
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,840
And I'm or curry dot com, I guess probably.

621
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,840
There will always be a link somewhere on the show notes so that you can.

622
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Take a look at these wonderful pictures of this absolutely wonderful automobile.

623
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
And it's not just mine.

624
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,840
It's yours as well because we're going to really experiment on this puppy.

625
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
And let's see what kind of fuels we can get in.

626
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
We're going to throw pure vegetable oil in.

627
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
We're going to do all kinds of stuff.

628
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,840
We'll go to San Francisco restaurants and pick up vegetable oil and cooking oil.

629
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,840
And we'll measure it performance.

630
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Well, it feels like it has about 80 horsepower as I drove it home from the office today.

631
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
So it's great.

632
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
I'm totally in love.

633
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
My, the new woman in my life is Trinity.

634
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Okay.

635
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
I'm not going to bore you with the ride back up the elevator.

636
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,840
I'll catch you there in about four minutes.

637
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,840
Right now, let's crank up some drive in music.

638
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:49,840
music.

639
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
I'm on a dead end street.

640
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Like a dog in the rain.

641
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I'm lost the sand.

642
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Where I'm headed is a memory.

643
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Where I'm going looks like where I'm feeling.

644
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,840
This could be a scene of a whole lot of miles.

645
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Of the world in the wrong direction.

646
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Let put in my youth.

647
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
These past me back.

648
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,840
And I wish somebody else would drive.

649
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I could stop at the station and ask the red chunks.

650
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,840
But you know that ain't cool.

651
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Come by, man, for a dollar and a half.

652
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,840
But I'm way too confused.

653
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Little friends, I never met.

654
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Said I know the way you go in.

655
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,840
I'm through the keys and said, get down.

656
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,840
And we can take my car.

657
00:26:48,840 --> 00:27:01,840
But only if you don't drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive.

658
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:34,840
music.

659
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
music.

660
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
music.

661
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
music.

662
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
music.

663
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
music.

664
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
music.

665
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
music.

666
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
music.

667
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
music.

668
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
music.

669
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
music.

670
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
music.

671
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
music.

672
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
music.

673
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
music.

674
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
music.

675
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
music.

676
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
music.

677
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
music.

678
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
music.

679
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
music.

680
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
music.

681
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
music.

682
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
music.

683
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
music.

684
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
music.

685
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
music.

686
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,840
music.

687
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
music.

688
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
music.

689
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
music.

690
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
music.

691
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
music.

692
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
music.

693
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,840
music.

694
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840

695
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,880

running on fire down the sunset street and the zerg skip from the glitchcast so

753
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,260
out of me that it's not working okay let's talk about something else that I wrote

754
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,540
down on my list of things to discuss with you I have recently changed I've

755
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:56,380
made a life a very important life decision and there's been a big change in

756
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,020
my life and I think most men will be able to understand what I'm talking

757
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:09,060
about when I say that I have switched from the Gillette Mach 3 Razor to the brand new

758
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,620
and I picked this up at Sainsbury's in the UK the brand new well it's not really

759
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:18,900
brand new I guess but it's the Wilkinson 4-bladed system and I've got to tell you

760
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:25,100
I am really digging it now we were actually a part well Ron and I with our previous

761
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,340
company think new ideas so this is a pre 2000 we were a part of the launch of the

762
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,620
Mach 3 the Gillette Mach 3 Razor campaign it was the most I mean this was like

763
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:41,060
you know that's a multi billion dollar business this Razor business and we went

764
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:47,060
to all the you know to the labs and we got the whole speel and whole low down on how

765
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,540
many times a man actually pulls the blade across his face with each shave which is

766
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,460
over a hundred times and we think about you start counting it you're like yeah

767
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:00,500
that's easily a hundred times and how the blades were made of you know little diamonds

768
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,620
shits on there and and the one and actually I remember someone from another advertising

769
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,580
agency raises hand and said oh can we you talk about that the blades last much longer

770
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:16,340
and I'll never forget the look on it was a VP on on this face it went completely dark

771
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:29,860
and he said we never ever ever talk about the life time of our blades so they

772
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,780
actually do not even tell you how many times you could shave with it I found with the

773
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,980
Mach 3's you could you could you could last almost a week with one razor with the

774
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,540
disposable or you know with one of the click things that you throw out I've had about four

775
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:48,420
shaves on the Wilkinson now I'm definitely a wet shaver I've tried the you know the

776
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,620
the dry electric razors and that how it just burns my face up so I'd love to hear what you're

777
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:58,260
using and what you think of the Wilkinson this is not a paid advertisement this is just me

778
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,260
purely out of interest you know it's interesting to switch once in a while it's almost like

779
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,180
when you smoke a different kind of weed you can get really used to to some kind and then you

780
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,460
smoke a different kind and then it really makes a difference by the way I'm down the stems here

781

00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:23,780
we can get the song as well uh oh man uh it's fantastic you know it's uh the something I've

817
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,620
been meaning to talk about and I don't really have all that much time left before the satellite

818
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:35,300
window closes everybody um it's about the levies that are special taxes that are put on a blank

819
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:42,100
media i think they started with the cassettes blank cassette tapes where the r i a a a would actually

820
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:48,340
there was it like a special tax that was put on top of the price of blank media blank cassettes

821
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,620
is when it started and that money went to the um I don't know if I went to the r i a a a or to ask

822
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,500
have b m i now that I'm not sure if it's probably the r i a a and they then of course distribute

823
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,780
that completely fairly amongst the artists who are of course being ripped off because home taping

824
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,300
remember that home taping is killing the music hmm seems to me like they did pretty well

825
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:18,420
um same goes for blank CDs now let me post this question to you because this happens uh in fact

826
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:26,340
I heard that um in some countries I don't know if I think it was an australia there was a 25 dollar australian

827
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:34,660
currency uh levie or tax put on the sale of iPods which recently I believe the owners

828
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,380
through a class action lawsuit now can get their 25 australian bucks back but I know that many

829
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:47,620
countries have considered this and I'm sure in the future the r a is gonna push that through that there's

830
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:59,060
going to be a tax on iPods and other MP3 devices now here's my question okay what right does the r i a a

831
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:07,060
have over podcasters for getting a piece of that money think about it for a second is there any

832
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:12,020
difference I mean they're they're talking about people putting MP3 files on these players

833
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:21,220
my shows an MP3 it gets put on the player you know I do work I'm creative uh there's absolutely no

834
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:27,940
difference in fact my uh file is much bigger so maybe I should even get a higher percentage of that money

835
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,860
and how will that work and how can the r a a defend that they're the only ones that should be

836
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:41,700
receiving the cash think about that for a second think about that and if you live in a country where

837
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,460
there is a tax on MP3 players please let me know I mean you know what screw that forget MP3 players how

838
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,660
about CDs I definitely know that are most countries in the world CDs there's a special tax on

839
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:59,220
CDs that goes to the r i a a a and to record companies I mean there are so many people who burn

840
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,340
podcasts on the CDs to listen to them in the car I think that we deserve to get a piece of that

841
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:11,540
if you're a lawyer if you have any uh special knowledge of this please feel free to

842
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:20,020
to jump into the conversation here so anyway um I don't really have time for another so

843
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,420
man I want to play another song but I really don't have you know what I think I can just fit this

844
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,980

846
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,860

857
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,980
Cause I just got paid

858
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,980
Get sick, get sick, get sick

859
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,980
Get sick, get sick, get sick

860
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,980
From a dad and take a fuck

861
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,980
And let a loser get lucky

862
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,980
Damn, girl, you look so fine

863
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,980
Don't you wanna get shoved

864
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,980
And I gotta get mine

865
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,980
Everybody would drink

866
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,980
And let's get it on

867
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,980
And go back to my place

868
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,980
Cause the three in the morning

869
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,980
Drop damn pennies

870
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,980
To lose their skirt

871
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,980
To let something to my bed

872
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,980
To do a little work to turn that

873
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,980
Cause I like it like that

874
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,980
Give me 10 minutes

875
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,980
And I'll call with you again

876
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,980

927
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:32,900
Some hot land at the prou 99 bottles of beer on the walls where you would find them

928
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
and you'd find that at the Podsake Music Network.

929
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,900
That's it for the Daily Source Code for today.

930
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:46,900
Let me see DailySourceCode.com is where you can find the latest show and the Podcast feed.

931
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,900
If you want to, you can subscribe.

932
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,900
Actually, the best thing to do is copy the link underneath that orange on a white XML icon.

933
00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:01,900
And they go to advance an iTunes and then subscribe to Podcast from there and just paste in what you copied.

934
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,900
Oh man, I got to fix this compressor.

935
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,900
That's really, it's a shitty ass sound.

936
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:14,900
And subscribe to it that way because sometimes the iTunes feed gets caught up and hung and you know, then we just, it's no good.

937
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,900
Adamacrate.com for all of your feedback.

938
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,900
And I'll be back here tomorrow for the Home Day Edition of the Daily Source Code.

939
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,900
Thank you very much for listening.

940
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,900
For those of you who are subscribed, please stay subscribed.

941
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,900
And I'll talk to you guys soon, bye.

942
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,900
