1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, here we are.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Just finishing up my touch interview.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Excuse me.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The one on a sec.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
At the infamous Groucho club in the UK, London.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
On a moment, let me just get my, who's the paper here.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a beautiful, beautiful day in London.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I mean, you could not believe how nice the weather is.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I mean, I brought my leather jacket with me, which is really too warm, actually,

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but just leave it, leave it dangling open.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm on Dean Street, and I need to go to my next appointment for today,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which is the TV Center, BBC TV Center, Wood Lane,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and that's W12.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not quite sure where that is, but what I'll do is I'll grab a cab.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So I'm going to see what the best place is.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm crossing Old Compton Street now.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hope that we're good on the sound.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It should be okay.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I cranked up the mic output a little bit.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And just walking down everyone's in a good mood today.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Lots of people on their cell phones as well.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Maybe they're all the week sound scene tours.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
By the way, today is Friday.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's the 18th.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is it the 18th already?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Friday the 18th of March, 2005.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is your daily source code for the weekend.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You see, I'm going to go over to 2005.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I thought someone was correcting me on the date, but he was just confused in the digital.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's see, Shafsbury Avenue.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let me see if I can grab a cab here.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is that the interesting?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think they should cross the street and get on the near corner.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Holy moly.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A little bit confused in Guilford.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We don't have as much traffic.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And I haven't really gotten used to the look right, look left thing.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, and there's a cab.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's see.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wow.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a great source here.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's...

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I forgot how hard it was to find a cab in London.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's take a look.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is that a cab coming up?

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Nope.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
See, dropping someone off or is he picking someone up?

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
See, come on over here, buddy.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Shoot.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think I'll just stand on the corner here for a second.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You see, if I can pick up a cab,

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
there's three cabs coming my way.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
See.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Nope.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
All full.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The time is three o'clock, have half an hour,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
to get to my destination.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It might even be within walking distance for all I know,

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
but I really can't be bothered.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You know, just stand on the corner here.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
See if I can grab one coming from the cross street.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nope.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Good.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's just difficult.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And everybody's full to the max.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So anyway, I just did this interview with the Dutch news program,

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
today from Dough, which means basically two today.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Channel two today.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think I explained that earlier.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It was a long interview, but it was really nice

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
because the interview or case, the reporter,

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
who had come over to interview me,

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
had really done his homework.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And he had a lot of really good questions.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He'd really thought about it.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He didn't ask me as many questions about Holland

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and the Dutch podcast scene as I thought the key would

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
or that he could have done.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think mainly because it was interested in all the bits of pieces,

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
because he once put together his own podcast,

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but it seemed like the name.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay, this is not a very lucky corner.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm just going to cross over.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Two.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Cross the street.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We're crossing.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What is it?

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
War, door streets.

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
War, door streets.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Nope.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's not all a man.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Every single cab is full.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It gives two cabs to come up.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Looks like one of the maybe empty.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, that gives the one.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is my man.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hello, TV Center.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's wood lane.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a beautiful weather today.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a lot better.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, it's great.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is it going to stay this way or?

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Can you stay slowly?

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Can't wait.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh yeah.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But you have the knowledge.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You have the knowledge.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, it doesn't acknowledge encompass everything.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, it's beautiful.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now I have to follow you on.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let me see if I have any more information on the TV Center wood lane.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, I'm going to the studio.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, fantastic.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I appreciate it.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Wow.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You have the radius that is very tight.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm already.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How much is that?

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No, it's okay.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Can you find that?

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Thank you.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay, here we are.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Did you see television center?

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Interesting.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Great.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Thank you.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's your table.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hello.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Adam Curry for Richard Taylor.

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Taylor.

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Thanks, though.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's look online.

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's the name of the program.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm not very helpful, Emma.

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Thanks, though.

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It is BBC World.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I have a cell phone number.

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Adam Curry.

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I said send him away.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Right.

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know, actually, it's not bad.

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But thank you for the compliment.

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
My wife just bought this for me.

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And I was planning on being shit weather today.

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So now it's just a style and fashion statement.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's all.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is it working?

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So I went one of those Beckham jackets.

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sign my name.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah.

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No kidding.

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And it's gonna be beautiful this weekend, I've ordered it.

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I know, just, I'm just a, I'm so tired.

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm working overtime.

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why are we, do you want me to make it rain, then, and that course?

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Will that be better for you?

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes.

181
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll talk to the man.

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Thank you very much.

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:04,600
Okay, I've pulled out the trusty cell phone again to, so I won't be so obvious

184
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:12,840
than I'm doing something to another, like talking to myself, and so I'm in the waiting room

185
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:19,240
here. It's actually pretty modern. It looks very cool. The guard, by the way, is half asleep,

186
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,920
standing there with his eyes closed. Whoop, they're just open, man, this guy's tired. So

187
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,440
it seems like there's a lot of people waiting here, a lot of young people, sorry. It's probably

188
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,520
like, maybe there's auditions going on today. It's funny to have a cappuccino of cart here in the

189
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:44,520
lobby. It's not really up for right now. Honestly, I could use a bit of food, but I think about it.

190
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:54,520
I haven't really eaten since breakfast. Let's see if Richard will show up to pick me up.

191
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,160
Yeah, I think there's some kind of auditions going on here for sure. What kinds of young

192
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,360
energetic people looking pretty bored, waiting, waiting around for God knows what.

193
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:17,960
Yep, watching TV, buzzing you here is the locks on the doors from the lobby.

194
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,200
Okay, I bet you this is Richard, he's coming down and it looks like a producer. I'm going to put

195
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,200
the cell phone down. Let's see if this is it.

196
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,360
Yes, Richard, how you doing? Nice to meet you. Likewise, I just got your voice

197
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:50,680
emails that you sent me. Well, first of all, I try not to get my past here.

198
00:13:52,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Yes, in here. Whoa, okay, this is an experience. I try not to be tied down by the mobile too much

199
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,440
to be honest, and I was actually at an interview for Dr. Television today, so I had it on silent.

200
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,080
So I understand what you want. Yeah, you certainly have something to speak to about the past

201
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,520
and we're having some visuals and what we can do. In fact, something else has come up. So anyway,

202
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:26,680
we've got news interactive people seem to use our lives. Who is a no-doing podcast? I'm interested

203
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,280
in doing some interview with you as well. Okay, so the way I thought I'd like it. And you're

204
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,720
told on the price and everything? Oh, yeah, we'll figure that out. I have to take our cut. Okay,

205
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:44,040
right, exactly. I said, they can nip in first, and she can ask all the questions and give

206
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,280
me the only one who knows how to do the camera work. I'll kind of be listening and just make sure

207
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,640
the frame is okay. Okay. And there's stuff that they don't cover, like the real basics,

208
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,520
which for our viewers, you know, they don't know. They're nip in after they've gone and asked

209
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:05,000
some, okay. Perfect. But are you up for me or one of us coming down and seeing you do the podcast

210
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
well, here's, no, but let me tell you why, because for the drink, oh, I'd love a drink there.

211
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,480
For the past, yeah, for the past nine months, yeah, I've done it at least ten times. My house

212
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,440
has been trampled on ten times. Really tired of doing that. So they come with a kiss of

213
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:31,160
smaller hours, like literally a small dv kit. It's not talking like three man, five man. No,

214
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,640
I understand, but also, to be quite honest, let's say what I said, I was like, what do you like?

215
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:43,800
Uh, a coffee, a cup of chino? Yeah, be great. I find it quite fake. Right. And the last time

216
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:52,280
I did it with CNN, I was like, it's just, it's not, it's, it's so contra to what podcasting is about.

217
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,360
And it looks so silly. If it's real, it looks so fucking silly because I sit there in front of a

218
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,680
laptop talking. Right. It's like this. However, what I did do for you, I have to notify you.

219
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,480
I'm doing a sound scene tour of the BBC. Okay. So if you want to talk about that, or if you

220
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,600
want to do something with that, I'm happy to do a sound scene tour outside, which is a big part of

221
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,280
podcasting. Okay. Well, that's a good interest to you. Okay. Uh, we might like this, um,

222
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,440
see what we need is pictures. I understand. Well, I'm so pretty though.

223
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,040
Well, probably this podcast doesn't bring that out enough. Well, here's what we could do.

224
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,680
Here's a podcast and we video. Oh, we'll get that. What we could do is, in a beautiful thing about

225
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,720
podcast, when you can do it anywhere, I brought my entire kit with me. Okay. So if you want to say,

226
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,040
hey, we'll go and do a podcast or a piece of a podcast somewhere else, other than my house,

227
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,480
and we can even do it today. Okay. That might be, that might be a fan. I'm glad you're

228
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,040
going to need to help us with that because if I'm going to be, you know, yeah, we can maybe

229
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,120
work because that is the beauty of it. Yeah. I got my laptop. I'm going to do anything.

230
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,920
Uh, the chinos. Okay. So what we're doing is we'll do the interview with them upstairs.

231
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:13,880
Mm-hmm. Dark room. It's fairly dark. It's quite creative. Dark room.

232
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,280
It answered them. A dark room has a whole different meaning. Yeah.

233
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm like, have those here in London as well? Not the BBC. Oh, I'm worried. Yeah.

234
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,960
BBC. It's on to. I like the BBC. Yeah. Now you must know. I'm thinking about this. You must

235
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:39,160
know Ken recounts you. Yes. He's a WBVH. Well, no, Ken, he may have been. I mean, Ken,

236
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,400
have you checked out Ken radio? Do you know about Ken radio? I've heard of it. I haven't

237
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,000
listened to Ken radio. I've got in touch with me. I mean, I've been doing this job

238
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,760
about four or five years now. And Ken got in touch with me about four years ago. And he said,

239
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,160
oh, you've got to check out Ken radio. What he got was in a sense was, he's not hot casting,

240
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:04,280
but basically he was, you know, getting his own radio station. Right. He was on the road. Right.

241
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,720
Right. Right. Streaming. Right. Streaming. Yeah. To the next. I do a number of this.

242
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,160
Thank you. I think he has a show every single day. And he's a podcast.

243
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,880
Well, now. Right. I think it's, yeah. I haven't checked out. I mean, he has daily Ken's

244
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,000
daily tech news, you know, feedy hands. Right. Yeah. I'm thinking, I haven't. I saw Ken

245
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,600
of C. S. briefly. I thought I would have thought I just thought he must know of him. I don't know

246
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,360
in person, but I have definitely heard of him. I think I've seen Ken's radio go through the

247
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,800
directory somewhere. I saw something like that. Sure. And basically he was in a sense.

248
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,360
I was thinking about podcast. I was thinking what you did was not necessarily anything hugely

249
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:50,120
technologically revolutionary, but you just saw that. Yeah. That's exactly right. I'm not a programmer.

250
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I'm not a, I'm not a, I'm not a technical guy. It took me a year. I asked program, please,

251
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,480
you make this program for me. I want, you know, to, to download shows that are in as

252
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,920
enclosures in RSS file and put them on my iPod. That's all I want is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not

253
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,520
how difficult can it be. But asking a software developer to do something is like asking someone

254
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,960
to do your homework. You know, so, and, and it's right, you know, as I went through that from month

255
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,520
and did it myself. But yeah, people like Ken and, oh, man, there's a, what's the guys up in the

256
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Alaska, a whole week radio? We've been doing this stuff for years. This is where the kind of

257
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,520
genus, at least on this level. I mean, so you're right. This stuff has been going on for years.

258
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,000
How much is it? Yeah. Creating the final, the final part of the distribution mechanism was what I really

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,400
did. Yeah. So, I stand on the shoulder of giants. That's basically it.

260
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,000
What you did is it's very clever in the sense that you just saw that that really sugar here, over here.

261
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:03,400
I told the people about the things they did. So, you picked it right on. I didn't invent.

262
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,720
People are bloating in the trees. I mean, I suppose it's creating that community. Well,

263
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,040
yeah, I would, I would place this for people to go and, you know, we're still kind of the, the, the

264
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:27,160
Pied Piper, um, in respect to, you know, this is my, my show has been a podcast, you know,

265
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,320
as one, you know, as long as this is as any of the podcasts has been out there. And so you kind of by default,

266
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,160
you get a lot of people tuning into you. Yeah. Um, no, but you've, you've, you've picked it. I mean,

267
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,760
this was, this was no, not brain surgery. Let's put it that way. I didn't need it. It's

268
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,520
someone with a 10, I mean, I wouldn't have been doing a 10, I would just say four, five years. I wouldn't have

269
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,360
a clue about programming. I mean, it sounds like you made a pretty decent crack. It's actually once,

270
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,800
once you get into it and you get into the zone, yeah, it's like doing a big ass spreadsheet, you know,

271
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,640
where you kind of know what, what's going to happen in cell F39, but you still got to kind of put

272
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,360
the little bits in there. So once you're into it, it's just like a different language. You know,

273
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:19,000
it's an, and I did this apple script, which is intended to be English, um, the kind of weird

274
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,080
sort of type of English. But yeah, so, and you know, you Google, you say, okay, iTunes apple scripts.

275
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,240
Yeah, I was like, oh, you got all bunch of scripts, you look at it, you stare at it, and you're bang

276
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,840
against it. Yeah, and then stuff starts to, and you know, you put something on the mail list,

277
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,400
or my weblog, hey, I'm stuck, and then people will gladly help you out. So, yep.

278
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm loving it already. Thank you. Beautiful carpet. Hello. Hi, Adam Curry. Hi, nice to meet you.

279
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,880
And this is our dark room, which isn't very dark at my moment. I was excited about the

280
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:05,880
dark room idea. It's a cold room as well. Mm. Right. Um, if you want to just throw my stuff on

281
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:19,240
not one of them. Oh, totally digging the temperature. Very nice. No, it's cold. It's

282
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,360
eaten. No, it's not really warm, but it's just, it's perfect. Oh, here, I want to be cold.

283
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:31,800
Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, my office, we don't get to see much of the outside. I'm sorry.

284
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,280
I'm sorry. I'm way in the other side of the room. I don't get to see much of the office,

285
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,880
you know, I'm like, you're not nice though. That's a nice one. Exactly.

286
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,640
From where the students dressing them. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just, are you a couple?

287
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,040
Are you okay? That would, like,

288
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,120
liberal here at the bases. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, making some.

289
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,040
Yeah, let me just decouple. So you can, uh, okay. Thank you.

290
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,080
Yes? What's the name of the show?

291
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,920
The blunt cast.

292
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,720
Be. L. U. G. G. Oh, that's you guys. I know, I fucked it up. Did. No, no, no.

293
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:23,400
Yeah, he did the bow-coder thing whatever. Yeah, I'll bring this up on this one. Yeah, sure the blood cast sure

294
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
That's cool

295
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Excellent

296
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,920
It's outside of the BBC's with me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right good power to you

297
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm just gonna put this up because you got my mic too, right?

298
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,920
You don't think I'd come to the BBC without doing some form of some form of sounds seem to order you

299
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,320
It wasn't rogue. I was telling him that I was doing it

300
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:16,680
Yeah, and he and he and he was yeah, it was like you guys got a stop swearing and

301
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,960
Now just do this this is what I was talking about

302
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,360
Yeah, so check this out so we they came for eight hours. It's a to Belgium and I said now

303
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,200
I'll do a little show for these guys. So I got the helicopter out did the whole thing, you know

304
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,440
And it was just like you know everything was stayed everything was set up, you know do that again the whole podcast that we did was

305
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,960
Basically fake, you know, so it's kind of perpendicular to what podcasting is about and then they called me like two days later

306
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,440
This would drop out on all the tapes

307
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,480
We got to come back and like I don't think I can handle it. I love you got. I don't think I can do another eight hours

308
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I think they finally fixed it, but

309
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,480
Wow, so the blood cast. Yeah, all right

310
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,800
I love it. Oh, it's so nice to meet you guys

311
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
That's it that's trippy for me, too

312
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,560
You know to put faces to the sounds and this is

313
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,600
The blood cast only been around for we've done four we made it all right

314
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Life got in the way

315
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Man, it's art. I love it

316
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
It's

317
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Whoops crunch

318
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
We'll just record over that another interview

319
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'll promise

320
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,480
It's an outrage but it's taken so long. I can't believe it. I watched click on left click on yeah, yeah several times sure

321
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Yeah

322
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,720
You know, it's very hard to explain simple concepts. It's just hard work and luckily I've been doing it for

381
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,520
I said I was gonna ask you dude that's a long story okay well we actually met years before we met

382
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:29,040
I was 17 and she was 23 and something like that and I was doing a pirate radio

383
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,920

384
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:44,320

386
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,440
and they had hired this British guy to play the lead role and he had the equipment but they didn't have

387
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:03,600
the voice so they wanted like this uh you know rough tumble American voice

388
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:11,120
and so I was basically I oh did the whole oh they're oh yeah baby so I was in studio two

389
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,040
in this because it was a big budget you know it's a real it was a real movie

390
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,480
when you were 17 yeah so I was so I was in the studio doing the other ooze in the eyes

391
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,360

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,960
and I got my my stogi it's I had no idea that I thought we actually walked out of a gate and it

412
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:20,800

413
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,520
current first I've come out of there uh huh well we were as TV sensors which is far more

414
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,160
impresses what were the studios are for the news is um and as various BBC sites dotted around

415
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,560
this part right so this is this is the new kind of media center areas and it's really far away from

416
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:48,320
waterloo station yeah that's what I'll be doing on my way back okay actually while I'm here it's

of a uh a nice Starbucks which is kind of on the grounds here at the BBC and yes they have Wi-Fi and

421

422
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,240
this is one thing I wanted to play for you guys this is a guy named Hank and he's got a site

423
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,480
called podrazer.com which has been the source of a lot of controversy recently on some of the podcast

424
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,880
so this about the way he's been providing a search results and he actually put a promo on an

429
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,120
during the uh during the uh interview I figured I played a little bit listen to these bitties

430
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,720
one of my favorite tracks I want to be famous. I want to be famous I want to win minks and

431
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:33,360
sattens and pearls. I want to be famous more than just any old girl.

432
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,880
I have to pay a license for this you know.

433
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:04,400
I want to be famous. Go to Paris on private flights. I want to have lovers by school.

434
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,120
How I love those girls I tell you. Let's see uh what else they come across today. Oh you know there was

435
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,920
a new raster web that came out. I haven't heard anything from Pete in such a long time. Let's see what

436
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,800
he's doing. He's always got something funny going on. This is the now-see here edition of the

437
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:28,720
Raster web audio for 2005-03-17. Okay folks well tonight we're going to be a very special

438
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,960
bit of I believe they call it a sound seeing tour. There you go. Of the office here in

439
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:42,480
really building. So first thing let me look that chair out of the way and now I don't have a

440
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,280
portable device so I'm just going to leave a computer recording and I'm going to have to let

441
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,280
us see. Of course you carrying the computer around.

442
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,640
There's a furnace back here and there's a lot of boxes and the next thing is some

443
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,120
more computers and it's like that and again back at the desk. If I go over here

444
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,320
there's our first right right here because we've got required right now to have the next night.

445
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,520
Over here like this is around the light. There's uh open the door and let's

446
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,480
go in here. Yeah you can always count on Pete to put everything into perspective. Can't you?

447
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,440
That's perfect. Okay let's go from that to uh what is it? A sound of the day. That's always

448
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,960
fun to hear what the sound of the day is. Let's see what Hans has got going for us today.

449
00:39:45,840 --> 00:40:06,480
So what is the sound? Oh okay. All right the sound of the day.

450
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,360
Something else I like to check in on by the way since podcasting is pretty much

451
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:21,920
international at this point. It's kind of cool. You can listen to Virgin Radio. They podcast

452
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:32,560
their morning show. Pete and Jeff. I don't really like that too much because it's just a rehash

453
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,200
of what they're doing already without the songs because well obviously licensing issues.

454
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,280
But I always like to keep in touch with what's going on back in the Netherlands radio station there

455
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,040
has a called North Sea. They have a a show biz report which they do every single hour and they're

456
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,040
podcasting that as well.

457
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Yeah just what I thought boring but then again we've got my buddy Rev Tim for the

458
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:20,160
inspirational message of the day. He's even stalled on my rant while not my transmitters.

459
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,800
He'd use the transmitters bit. It's great.

460
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,480
Sorry. Can you just talk me through what you've got on here with a different set? Sure. Well actually

461
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:48,800
a couple of things. Let me just get rid of this. Okay the way I record actually is quite simple.

462
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:57,760
You know I'll open up my, oh this is no one's really seeing this. Okay this is how I prep my show

463
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:06,240
that's why it's called DSC Daily Source Code Temp. It's an outline. Some things don't change at the top

464
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,880
so I've got my my show details that may change just the date so that's clearly an old date.

465
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,960
And these are all individual files. I usually start off with one of these. Now what's cool about this

466
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,160
is all I have to do is hit command and a comma and over to the left. You'll see

467
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,800
or it's starting up. You'll see that it opens up a quick time window. Do you want to do that again?

468
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:38,400
Yeah sure. Sure. So I could either double click this or I could just hit a keyboard command

469
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,400
which is the Apple key and a comma and immediately opens up right there. It opens up a quick time

470
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:54,160
player. So what I'll do is now open up my sweeper and then I'll open up my power of pure intellect.

471
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,600
So I kind of line these up in a row and then I've got a mash up here as an email about it.

472
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,160
So I haven't actually downloaded or put that one in so I can go to my

473
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,880
my tools menu over here. I'll say load new files. Now it's going to load up new files and bring

474
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,960
it my file library. Oh this is no one's ever really seen this. I'll tell you this is a

475
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:40,160
fine. So what this program does is it basically scans through a folder of MP3 files and pulls

476
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,560
out the ID3 information and puts it into my playlist. So a young palette which a lot of you have

477
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,960
heard of, he has his hit test. So it's basically there's hit test groups. There's hit test number

478
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,560
26. So these are all the new files that I haven't played yet. So what I'll do is I'll see there's

479
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:03,120
also an unknown folder. I don't know what Burger King is but I put it into for a reason. So we'll take

480
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:12,080
all these, we'll just copy them, close that window and we go over to my rundown. I paste them in

481
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,680
and I just put those in a line up. Usually I put the young's hit test a little bit later.

482
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,400
I don't remember what the Burger King thing is. Let's see what that is. So I'll just

483
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,800
click that. It should then open up a player window. There you go. So just as an audition, let's see,

484
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,840
what is that? Yeah, I'm over here. I'm over here at Burger King. I haven't done for many.

485
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,600
It sounds like a sound scene tour or something I wanted to let people here. So anyway,

486
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:46,160
so I'll take this mashup, which is called, they got an email about it. The drop system

487
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,560
versus Adam Curry. So that's digital interference. So I'm going to bring that over.

488
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,480
So you see, so there's the song. I'll open that up. So the way I would do it,

489
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:08,000
it's I start usually with, I hit that and then I hit that and then I say, hey, I think I

490
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:16,880
got it's right everybody. So anyway, there's this great mashup that came through. It's called

491
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,800
the drop system versus Adam Curry. Let me let me see what that's all about. This is something that

492
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,440
came through. I haven't listed as a TSA mashup. I'm not quite sure what that means. Let's check it out.

493
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:37,600
This is a digital interference. Oh, it's about, it's a mix, it's a mashup of me complaining

494
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,280
about airport security in the States. It's really cool.

495
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:58,480
It's really funny, actually.

496
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,160
Not protecting. I won't do a PML, not this.

497
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,800
OPML, oh boy. OPML was the language that this outliner talks. So,

498
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:21,600
if I want to export this, it actually is exported as a version of XML. So it's structured data,

499
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,920
even though it looks kind of kind of unstructured. You can make these nodes all kinds of

500
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,200
exciting things. So as you can see, in this case these nodes, when I click on them, they open up a

501
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:40,000
sound file, but a node can also just have other stuff behind it. So for instance, pod safe is

502
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,040
like a collection of pod safe music that I haven't played yet. It's only one or mashups,

503
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,320
for instance. I got several of those. So, and it's all cut and paste and you can move stuff up and down.

504
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,880
It's just a way of organizing stuff. It's, you know, it's what we do in the broadcast world, right?

505
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:04,960
We have a rundown of stuff. So every day, young polette, blesses heart, sends me the hit test,

506
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,800
and I think I can play it right now.

507
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:21,920
Want to play? Ready? Ready? Okay. Okay. Because then you got to play along. You got to guess the song.

508
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,960
Now, your eye tag here doesn't actually, is not playing any role root hall. No. You're recording

509
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,280
your podcast and I need some shots of that. Yeah, yeah, you can do it with that. I agree with her.

510
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,880
So have you been continuously recording for the last 4-8? You just left it running, can you?

511
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,560
Yeah, I remember. Two and a half hours. How long is the battery?

512
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,800
Well, it's still full. So, I put a fresh one in before I, before I started.

513
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,800
Haven't found out yet. This is the longest I've actually done this.

514
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,920
But I'm to edit this down because there's no way, you know, there's absolutely no way this feels.

515
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,240
That's okay. I mean, the cab ride was half an hour of nothing. I talked to the cabbie for like

516
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,640
10 minutes. You know, it's like, and then I'm just looking for anything that you could put into your podcast.

517
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,520
Yeah, sure. Just hear aware of this. No, no, no. So I felt really self conscious of the back going,

518
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,640
I hope he doesn't hear me. All right. But he'll think I'm an idiot talking to myself.

519
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,320
All casting star of dishes is basically taking anything you want from the world around you.

520
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,320
Yeah. I know you can put it online without having to ask anyone to mention all. Well,

521
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:46,320
No, I don't know. I think the BBC is covering me on this one. So come on, play along with the hit test. Let's see if we can

522
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,120
We're going to get you all the time for the hit test.

523
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,840
Hello, yeah.

524
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:04,080
Oh, it is a footstep edition footstep edition. I did the five, the next three trials by the footsteps.

525
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:10,560
Okay, Michael Jackson's thriller. That was easy. That was easy.

526
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,120
How are we get it again?

527
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,720
Okay, and this is number two.

528
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,760
No, no, you know what that is. That's, um,

529
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:38,720
rocks your music. Love is the drug. I think this is a good one.

530
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
What is that?

531
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,120
Very good. Very good. You don't know if it's right. I mean, but I'm pretty sorry.

532
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,240
Okay. Time's up. And these are the answers. This is number one.

533
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:04,240
That was easy. If anyone in the world would recognize that one. Yeah.

534
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,640
And this one's legendary. And what else could it be? The Michael Jackson.

535
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Sorry to miss this guy. He's a young pull-up. He's a Dutch guy who just does this every day.

536
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,480
And he has his own hit test podcast. It has really interesting guys.

537
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,760
All right, on the number two.

538
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,000
It's really different. There's just a few seconds to

539
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,680
15 minutes to 45 minutes today somewhere in there. Yeah, love is the drug.

540
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,720
That's a good idea to do this story.

541
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:15,360
I'll tell you though. He did a hair band guitar solo hit test.

542
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,640
I didn't know one of them. I didn't know one of them. It was horrible.

543
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,760
Now, now it's a few seconds or three.

544
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,680
I think you're right. Yep.

545
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,000
That was the bass. The bass line gave this one away.

546
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,600
And club chopper canna.

547
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,440
Extra points for knowing the lyrics. Yeah, very good.

548
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,160
I think you just did.

549
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,120
It's not me.

550
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,080
Did you get? Yeah, he came out. He used to come out dressed in his dressing gown.

551
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,520
Well, the first time I showed him the scar I went with my friend and we were actually there with a tape recorder.

552
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,200
In fact, this was 20 years before you were doing this. Yeah, sure. We were on the tape recorder.

553
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,160
And we said that as a school project, we were doing, we need to do some interviews and stuff.

554
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,680
And we were amazed. We got his number from the phone book. He's a dress.

555
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,920
And the phone book. That was great. I found it from two years earlier before he'd become famous.

556
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,480
Right. We didn't go to see. We went down to Chilton Avenue where we knew his parents did.

557
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,760
Not to install and learn. But hold your hands as the door and it's dressing calm. That's great.

558
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,400
And we're standing there, two, 14 euros. Can't take a good one.

559
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,960
Yeah, that's what he's like. I'm going to help you. I said, yeah, we're doing a school project.

560
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,600
Yeah, I just want an interview. I said, I've made this scrapbook and he was so taken with this scrapbook.

561
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,480
He said, do you mind if I keep it for a couple of weeks? And he said, yeah, he was picking through.

562
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,480
He said, I haven't seen half of these photos. Wow. So he goes, come back in a couple of weeks.

563
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,600
And I re-went back and he asked the door again. He gave us a little interview on the door set.

564
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,400
Yeah. And he gave me this scrapbook back and when I was at that, I guess in a cab or something on the way home,

565
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,880
I looked in the scrapbook and he'd cut out piece of paper and he put some blue tack on the back of it.

566
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,600
Put it in the scrapbook and he put two Richard, thanks for supporting us. Andrew and she

567
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:35,600
got George sign up as well. Wow. That's great. And I met him again years later.

568
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Did you remember it? Yeah. Well, I said to him, I was the kid. And then I kind of struck up a bit of

569
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:45,120
relationship with him and I had a remiss one after the team. And my parents, very cringe-worthy,

570
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,960
asked Andrew, turned out that Andrew's mum, you might want more something. And so my parents asked

571
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,200
Andrew and George to my profits. Did they both come? They didn't come. They sent me the biggest card.

572
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,760
And I've still got it to stay. It says to Richard wishing you every happiness and life

573
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,200
at Andrew and George Michael. So you're later when I met up with Andrew and George didn't remiss and

574
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,360
really met him. Andrew, I said to him, I was the 14-year-old that came in. Yeah, yeah, I remember.

575
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,200
And he was still as friendly as ever, a very humble guy. I mean, you know, I don't know what he's up to.

576
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,200
You just gave me the best part of the whole sound seeing towards the bed. That was a great story.

577
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,280
It was fantastic. I mean, I was literally, it got some of it. Andrew is the best guy in

578
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,080
George. It was a very, very strange look at the bed. Yeah, I met him a couple times at the height of

579
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,880
the, you know, like, see, it was, um, I'm talking about it. It was the faith CD. Right.

580
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,480
Well, I met him in 88. 88. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he was struggling with a lot of personal issues. He was.

581
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:45,520
Because I knew his manager, Michael Lippman. Yeah. Um, because he managed trying to

582
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:53,440
countner Gray Slick's daughter who was working on MTV. And, uh, yeah, George was very, and he's

583
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,680
pretty open about it now. He's got all men. I was such an asshole back then because, you know, he,

584
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,560
he really knew his sexuality was taking one way. His career was taking another way. And he was,

585
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,600
then he got a little messed up there for a while. Absolutely. And, um, because it is saying,

586
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,600
I mean, basically, we're all staying at hotel in Hawaii. This is where he kicked off his faith for

587
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:18,160
an 88. Yeah. I remember that. Yes, sure. And it was at the Kahali Hill in Hawaii. And, and he didn't

588
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,480
bite an Andrew to do it. Dude, I was there. No, so was so as I. And, uh, Andrew was there.

589
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,600
Elton was playing. Yep. Yep. Elton John was there. John Reed, Elton's manager. Yeah.

590
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,360
Uh, and George Michael and Andrew Richie. And we, um, I'd rather than I started talking to Elton

591
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,880
John on the way to the tennis courts as you know. Of course. And, uh, and then Elton says,

592
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,320
I want to come with us to the, uh, come with us to the concert. Uh, he's right. He was like, hey, Richard,

593
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:53,920
you look pretty hot. Well, yeah, maybe. Come on. And, yeah, I was 17 at the time. And,

594
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,520
Brian, but not that naive. Where what might be happened. Um, but he said, how are you?

595
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,280
That's what I said. I said, but somebody here for us said, we're all over the country. So,

596
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,040
one of the things in the concert, I'm playing there. Cut long story short. He ended up taking

597
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,080
to the concert. Really? That's cool. Uh, stropping out before he actually went into the concert.

598
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,840
Stripping out, stropping out. He had a fit. He had a hissy fit. Oh, okay. Really? Yeah, because

599
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:23,840
he was walking in with my brother and I into the backstage entrance of this, uh, blood. And

600
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,080
uh, of the, uh, of the concert venue and the concert didn't recognize him. And he pushed him

601
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,160
up. He said, uh, so you actually use another, you know, drums, like, right? Do you know I am?

602
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,960
And I go, sir. I don't care who you are, right? Yeah. And he kind of nudged it. And Elton has

603
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:43,440
a freak out. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I mean, this story just goes on and on and on. And, um, it's great.

604
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,840
But it was an unbelievable time. And anyways, I said to Elton, just get back to you. I said,

605
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,040
what's the deal with George White? There's a guy who's not okay. And what he said,

606
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,520
she doesn't know what she is. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. I found out how they would reach

607
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:04,720
all these quick, these weird, great names. Oh, yeah. But you were there as well. Yes, because I was

608
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,600
working for MTV and we were covering the tour, which I know kicked off in Hawaii. In fact,

609
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,400
that was, uh, I'm going to tell you the date. It was, uh, the cool ATA, I reckon.

610
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:21,600
No, I think it was later. Was it? I seem to remember it was April, ACA. Oh, seven seconds.

611
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:29,120
No, you're right. It was, uh, I think. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because,

612
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,240
and, uh, no, it was April. I'm sorry, you're right. April,

613
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:44,160
because April fifth, Patricia and I got married at Town Hall, the City Hall in New York.

614
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,200
Literally, it was like, hey, how about today? Yeah, good idea. Because otherwise,

615
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,520
she would be deported, right? And she wanted this contract with me. Right. So what happens if you

616
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,480
don't like me anymore? I gave up my career and everything and you can kick me out and I can't even

617
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,680
stay in this country legally. So what we can make, like, you know, some kind of a green, but

618
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,520
say, well, why don't you just get married? That's a lot easier. And she said, you better get down

619
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,120
in your knees, boy. So, and literally, uh, so we had agreed to do that and it was a beautiful Friday

620
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:15,200
afternoon. Um, and, uh, I called her for MTV and I said, how about today? She said, yeah, sure,

621
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,000
you know, and so I pulled Steve Leads, uh, the talent managers, and you're a witness, went down,

622
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,000
got married. And the next day, um, I went off, uh, to cover the George Michael tour. Was that flashing?

623
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,120
That means I have about an hour left on this flashing, depending on how long it's been flashing.

624
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:41,760
So the next part is I'm building this little box that, uh, I just want to be able to mix this in

625
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,000
so that while I'm talking, I could, you know, hit a song and it would report as well.

626
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,360
So I don't, so, uh, I don't want to, I don't, yeah, it's an iPod.

627
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,680
Well, how many gigabytes? How many gigabytes? 400. Isn't it a wonderful question?

628
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,760
This is a 30 gigabytes. How much is it in the book? I'm not selling it.

629
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:06,320
I'm not selling it. I'm on camera. Yes, you are. Sorry. This is mine.

630
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,640
Why are you, what are you doing? Is that beautiful?

631
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,760
Oh, I'm just, it's not an advert. That's, isn't that horrible? It's not, hi, buy this iPod.

632
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,160
Why are you doing something from the ads? You like that, huh?

633
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,200
Why the side? Is it just a game zone?

634
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,080
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no games. I'm not a gamer.

635
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,800
You heard, have you heard of a podcast? Yeah.

636
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:32,720
Yeah. What, what make is iPod? Yeah, but listen, let's, uh, that's, uh, I river is what that is.

637
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,680
What's that, what? Run, that was you. So, you think you could run away then?

638
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,840
You could run far around here, mate. You could run far around here, mate.

639
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,240
There's a security guard. It's about 300 meters.

640
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,680
You guys work for the BBC? No. Yeah, we're the time.

641
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,840
Careful. It's recording. Careful.

642
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,360
Oh, so you're saying, you're about why you shouldn't be for that purpose in there.

643
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,080
Because, hey, you think they could run faster than me? Yeah.

644
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,080
I don't know, but you were saying, I mean, I'll hold on to everything.

645
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,080
You guys look pretty dangerous to me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

646
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,120
So, it's just, is this, is this the BBC grounds?

647
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,680
Uh, you just calling me. No, this is technically right.

648
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,240
No, this is like three there. This is like the plot where the bomb is going to go.

649
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,720
Oh, this is the spot? Yeah.

650
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,960
And when does that happen? When does that, uh, scheduled?

651
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,600
About five seconds. Yeah, I love these kids. Yeah.

652
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,960
Two guys. One, get the record.

653
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,160
Grab the iPod. What? Get set.

654
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,400
Better not. I'm holding on to it. And these guys are worrying me.

655
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,080
But I'll see you. Okay.

656
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,000
What are you doing this for?

657
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,680
Oh, I'm doing it. Just a little interview. So, you actually have heard of podcast?

658
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,920
Yeah. Have you listened to any? No.

659
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,760
No. Do you have an iPod? No, no.

660
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,000
Do you have an MP3? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

661
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,960
Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to sleep there.

662
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,960
I was going to get you an iPod. Which one do you have?

663
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,960
Um, so you didn't just go get it.

664
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,480
Okay, it's on. Is it on? Is it on? Yeah.

665
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,280
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I'm just going to go get it. How much?

666
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,160
How much? 512. Yeah, that's good.

667
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,160
I'm going to do a lot with that.

668
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,800
Cool.

669
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,600
That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.

670
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,600
It's good. It's good. It's good. Is it fake? I'm pushing you.

671
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,240
Yeah. That's good. That's good, actually. Yeah.

672
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,000
Okay. So, it's a mock. I'm just going to watch you now.

673
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,120
It's a, it's a cold cappuccino. That's it.

674
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,120
These looks like cigars.

675
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,880
Whenever I can, I'll play something for you guys. You'll love this.

676
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,120
This is what DJ you don't want to fuck with.

677
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,160
Go heat on and radio very often. Do you?

678
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,000
What are you guys listening to? You listen to radio?

679
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,600
You listen to what?

680
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,880
You said. Sorry?

681
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
You said. I didn't.

682
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,920
You got on the on that sound swore.

683
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,800
Didn't that horrible? No. No. It's.

684
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,080
Yeah. This is what DJ you don't want to fuck with.

685
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,280
I'm corrupting Britain's youth. I'm so proud of myself.

686
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,480
Yeah, we got it.

687
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,480
Okay, guys, take care.

688
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,400
Oh, seriously, were they going to nick something and run off with it?

689
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,520
You handle that pretty well because they did it in another world they might not.

690
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,880
They might have. Oh, yeah, they might have.

691
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,640
They're just kids. Yeah, and they're just kids.

692
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,240
Kids who like making laptops.

693
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,480
But he's right. There's someone around here actually.

694
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,080
This is not a nice part of town.

695
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,920
Around here, it would be known to literally grab open passenger doors.

696
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,680
Take bags. Yeah, sure.

697
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,680
Doesn't, I mean, okay, this is London a bit.

698
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,880
That's happening right. This isn't really.

699
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,200
This isn't really.

700
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,480
It's not really up above like the real.

701
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,480
Yeah, and there's comfortable stages around there.

702
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,040
Mm-hmm.

703
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,880
And they're occasionally close to London.

704
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,880
Sure. This is London. This is like.

705
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,720
Yeah, that's, that was pretty real.

706
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,160
And, uh,

707
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,120
What, the, uh, the underground? Yeah.

708
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,160
You think? I don't know.

709
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,640
I was going to take a cab because they're on the ground much faster

710
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,000
or probably a little bit faster to be honest.

711
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,520
At this time of the day, the best way to get to Waterloo.

712
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,160
Yeah.

713
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,240
It's, this goes straight through town on the central line, uh,

714
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,680
Waterloo is on the Jubilee.

715
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,080
So you basically just change up on the street, it's two stops.

716
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,240
It will take you from here to get to Waterloo

717
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,600
maximum half an hour.

718
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,120
If you're trying to get to Waterloo, um, at this time of day,

719
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,440
you'll take you close on it three quarters an hour an hour.

720
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,280
By cab, you're there. Okay, it's it.

721
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,480
So I want to hop on which you want to go, um,

722
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,960
eastbound, yeah, into central London.

723
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,600
Yeah.

724
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,720
A bond street, yeah.

725
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,480
Which is about eight and nine stops a minute.

726
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,640
Okay. Southbound and it's about three stops.

727
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,520
Okay.

728
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,800
Couldn't be easier.

729
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,600
It's been a pleasure.

730
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,800
I like that.

731
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,520
And, um, I think, you know, this isn't going to go out immediately.

732
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,120
It's going to go out probably next month or so.

733
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,560
It's got some editing work to do out there.

734
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,720
But Joe is going to want to be some, uh, on, uh,

736
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,520
news and subtracting.

737
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,640
That's right anyway. So cool.

738
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,560
And that's going to go, you know, hundreds of thousands of

739
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,760
getting to Waterloo.

740
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,840
Lovely. So, um, okay.

741
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,040
Well, let's, uh, let's stay in touch.

742
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:25,600
Okay.

743
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,320
I think, uh, anything going on or whatever just let me know.

744
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:28,960
Definitely.

745
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,440
I hope you do.

746
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,720
And I have a nice whole day as well.

747
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,600
Thank you very much.

748
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,720
Uh, we're going, uh, 12 days, I think.

749
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,440
Yeah, oh.

750
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:35,920
Whereabouts.

751
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,560
Miami.

752
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,120
Nice.

753
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:37,920
Yeah, down the south.

754
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,120
You're my partners down there.

755
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,120
So, uh, we got infrastructure.

756
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,160
Okay, I'm walking.

757
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,120
All right, take care of you.

758
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:45,680
Right.

759
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,120
I'm actually going to do this with the, uh,

760
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,400
underground, the tube.

761
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,160
I mean, the tube.

762
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,960
Um, uh, let me see.

763
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,880
What's the time?

764
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,680
I got it.

765
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,160
Yeah.

766
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,480
Six o'clock.

767
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:11,040
Oh, I'd like to go to Waterloo Station.

768
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,560
Can you tell me how to get there?

769
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,880
You go to Bonds 3.

770
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,200
So, okay.

771
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,160
But it would be a lie.

772
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,720
So, uh, can I purchase tickets for that trip here?

773
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,040
Okay.

774
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,120
So, the barn street, and then I change on to what?

775
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,560
It should be the light.

776
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:31,440
The?

777
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,240
It should be the.

778
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,080
Yeah.

779
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:34,240
Yeah.

780
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,560
Yeah.

781
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:45,840
Thank you.

782
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,080
Okay, okay.

783
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,080
Like I fucking know what I'm doing here.

784
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,080
Okay.

785
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:14,800
See, he's down.

786
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,280
It's about three and four.

787
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:20,960
Okay.

788
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,200
So, they're going for me.

789
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,000
They've got to put them.

790
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,760
I think I've been in a subway in 20 years.

791
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,080
Okay.

792
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,400
I love you so much.

793
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,200
I love you so much.

794
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:49,680
I love you so much.

795
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,320
I love you so much.

796
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,680
I love you so much.

797
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,120
I'm the cell phone here.

798
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,560
So, I'm at White City.

799
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,520
Station, White City station.

800
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,920
And, uh, taking these subway for the tube to

801
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,760
on street and then hopping on the

802
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,200
Jubilee line, which should take me to

803
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:16,960
water station.

804
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,400
Boy, now the real adventure starts.

805
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,440
It's a busy one.

806
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,760
Welg.

807
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,920
I might start coming in a bit earlier.

808
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:32,560
This is the first time I've ever seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my

809
01:08:32,560 --> 01:09:02,560
I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a woman in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I have never seen a man in my life, I've never seen a man in my life, I've ever seen a man in my life here,

810
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:26,560
We'll be toasters and other advertisements, so we may have a plan some music.

811
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,560
Given the pound, always support your local musicians.

812
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:39,560
Maybe the RIA will come down to crack on him for performing that song in public.

813
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,560
Okay, now we're out.

814
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,560
Wow, do you believe that?

815
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,560
Yeah.

816
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,560
In this way, you're going to have a great day.

817
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,560
I'd like to be part of that bridge.

818
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,560
I'd like to be part of that bridge.

819
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,560
I'd like to have a long escalator.

820
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:04,560
I'd like to weigh down to the depths.

821
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,560
Thank you.

822
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,560
Man, could be any visitor.

823
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,560
An action that construction will take us any attention to.

824
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,560
Yeah?

825
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,560
In the right of the center of the wall.

826
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,560
Thank you.

827
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,560
We'll be back.

828
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,560
I'll be back.

829
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,560
I'll be back.

830
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,560
Yeah.

831
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,560
We'll be back.

832
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,560
That's the same thing.

833
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,560
You got to be back.

834
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,560
You got to be back.

835
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,560
I'll be back.

836
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,560
I'll be back.

837
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,560
I'll be back.

838
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,560
I'll be back.

839
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,560
Okay.

840
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,560
Take it around.

841
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,560
Thanks.

842
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,560
I'll be back.

843
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,560
Yeah.

844
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,560
I'll be back.

845
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,560
I'll be back.

846
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,560
I'll be back.

847
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,560
Oh, we're going down.

848
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,560
I'll be back.

849
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,560
I'll be back.

850
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,560
I will be back.

851
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,560
Well, we're going down.

852
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,560
What a loo.

853
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,560
Three styles perfe.

854
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,560
Dude, I can get used to this year.

855
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,560
I'll be back.

856
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,560
I'll be back.

857
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,560
If you get it, you'll be back.

858
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,560
If you get it, you'll be back.

859
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,560
If you get it, you'll be back.

860
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,560
For the end of the year.

861
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,560
I'll be back.

862
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:19,560
Okay, I'm a little worried that we're gonna, not, that's still good, let's see, how's

863
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:28,560
the, that's the still recording, yep, we're good, we're just going to let it run out.

864
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,560
Or until I get on the train and actually start to edit some of this stuff down.

865
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:57,560
We've done it in exactly twenty-five minutes, which are right.

866
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:04,560
Very right, and the last idea is this way.

867
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,560
So, here we are, people just dashing off.

868
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:17,560
Let's see, they get the train, we see Northern line, no?

869
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,560
I think I gotta go up.

870
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:26,560
That's indeed up we go, and hopefully that'll bring me right to water illustration.

871
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:32,560
That wouldn't be great if I had a connection at the train waiting for me.

872
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:40,560
Just as I have arrived, we're going up a very long, very steep escalator.

873
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,560
Really busy.

874
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:48,560
Plenty of people trying to get home awake for the weekend, couldn't be a busy time on them.

875
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,560
These are your day, but everybody's pretty happy, it's been a beautiful day outside.

876
01:12:52,560 --> 01:13:00,560
Nice sunny, and we're looking forward to a very, very nice weekend.

877
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,560
Now, what do I need down?

878
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:08,560
Where the hell am I?

879
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:15,560
Waterloo, okay, right out.

880
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:21,560
More escalators, man, this is almost like Universal Studios.

881
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,560
The Russian metal look, kind of funky.

882
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:33,560
It's almost like the Star Wars ride, really interesting.

883
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:38,560
That's design, or if it's just falling apart.

884
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:46,560
It actually looks like, well, stay down the right, it was small, okay.

885
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:54,560
And we were really far down, I couldn't hear my ears pop as I'm ascending.

886
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,560
More people brushing by on the left, in a hurry to get home.

887
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,560
Or just wanted to exercise on the escalator.

888
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,560
That was pretty interesting.

889
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:14,560
I had the phone up to my ear, and a voicemail came in, and the bling deafened me.

890
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,560
All right, let me see, what'll we do?

891
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:22,560
I think we've done it, now we're going to eat them.

892
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,560
Hey, let's get going now.

893
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:34,560
When using the voicemail, always touch it, and then I'll get it here, especially when you can.

894
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,560
Here's something interesting.

895
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,560
There's more gates to go through.

896
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,560
I don't know which ticket I have to show.

897
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:47,560
I have was my return ticket.

898
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,560
I don't tell me I lost that.

899
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,560
Shoot.

900
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,560
All that I said.

901
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,560
This is not good.

902
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,560
Just pull everything out here.

903
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:10,560
Here, no, that's not even a shit.

904
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:15,560
I thought I had my return ticket here.

905
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,560
All right.

906
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,560
Can you replace that?

907
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,560
I'm going to wash down.

908
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,560
Oh, boy.

909
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,560
That really sucks.

910
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,560
I didn't even lose it.

911
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,560
Okay, I thought I put it in my wallet here.

912
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,560
I've been working on it for a long time.

913
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,560
Really?

914
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,560
I've fucking misplaced it.

915
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,560
I'll damage it.

916
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:55,560
I can't help it.

917
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,560
I can't help it.

918
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,560
Put it away.

919
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,560
I can't help it.

920
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,560
We have legs on the bamboo.

921
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,560
It's longer than that.

922
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,560
Take a tour.

923
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,560
I've just made the ticket.

924
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,560
I'm going to try to encircle my exercises.

925
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,560
We can't have various problems.

926
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,560
However, we have good services.

927
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:21,560
Operating from more of their own plans.

928
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,560
Go fucking.

929
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,560
Oh, there it is.

930
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,560
I knew I had it.

931
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:34,560
I didn't put it where I thought I had it.

932
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:42,560
Okay.

933
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:54,560
Excuse me, which ticket do I have to use here?

934
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,560
This one here, mate.

935
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,560
That's what you know I went up.

936
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,560
That's the show that you paid when you've come in there.

937
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,560
Thank you very much.

938
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:14,560
I'm going to encircle this one, mate.

939
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,560
Okay.

940
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,560
Into one of your stations.

941
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,560
See the departure is good for us.

942
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:32,560
It's over it.

943
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:38,560
One, two, one.

944
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,560
You can't stop breathing.

945
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:50,560
You might spill the ground like something.

946
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:57,560
6 years, we're gonna be qualified to come now, I'm gonna do the walk on the left, let's put it over here.

947
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:06,560
Now it's me rushing in and out there, flying too, but take me to the field.

948
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:27,560
I have to do the walk on the left, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.

949
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:58,400
Now to find the first class carriage, which of course is going to be completely at the

950
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,240
other end of the train, time now 1835.

951
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:15,480
Perfect timing, love it when a plane comes together, and then we can sit down and edit out

952
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:25,040
all the long silent bits, and maybe I'll even have to show it ready for uploading when I hit

953
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:48,780
up, see where's the first class carriage, hmm, there isn't

954
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:25,780
I'm going to turn off the recording now, have a great weekend everybody, bye
