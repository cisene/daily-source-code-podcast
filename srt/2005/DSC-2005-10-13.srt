1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Delta Sierra Charly, 259 are good evening or good morning, wherever you happen to be.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,760
This is Adam.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,320
Adam Curry here in the Amstall Hotel in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,520
It is the, as you can tell, the ambiance, you immediately get an idea that when I say that

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,320
I am now overlooking the Amstall River, it is actually technically, it is, I don't know,

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,640
I've got some wires dangling here.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,720
It is past midnight, so it is a Thursday, October 13th, 2005.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm here on some business, which I actually, my business is the big part of my business.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,760
I got some business, dammit, my business, B tomorrow, 930, I've got some appointments.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,560
It's like legal crap and stuff.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,480
So just, you know, stuff that you just can't schedule your life anyway, other, you know,

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,600
can't schedule around it, it's kind of inconvenient, but then again, isn't legal crap always

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
inconvenient.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,080
So, whoo, man, there is a lot, a lot to go through.

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,640
First of all, let me say that I made a critical, critical error.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,280
I'm not talking about the iPod video, we'll get to that later on.

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Now, of course, you know about the power book, you know about the whole situation, you know,

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,440
that I'm basically working off of a firewire drive where I reinstalled most of my stuff,

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,240
and I was actually hoping that today, and I don't even know if new Macs were announced or not,

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,720
I mean, I've only seen news about the video iPod.

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,360
So, oh, I should, what we're doing that, I might as well just go ahead and surf over there.

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm not recording on the Mac, and I will tell you why.

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,200
So, I, you know, I'd basically gone and rebooted my entire life, and I, you know, I figured out

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,240
all the pieces I wanted and didn't want to carry with me, and I reinstalled all my applications,

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,840
and, you know, so I figured when I, you know, want to run the road just for a quicky like this,

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,240
you know, I'll just bring the, just bring the power book and be able to record everything.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,640
Wow, that thing does look pretty cool, the video iPod, I'm looking at it right now.

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,000
The new iPod, now playing music podcast photos, home movies, TV shows, music videos,

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,480
and it will give you a blue job, 30 gigabytes, 60 gigabytes, starting at 299.

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:37,800
Cool. And iTunes 6, oh, okay, so we have new iTunes, which means we have over 2,000 music videos,

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,720
hit TV shows, and more. Fucking brilliant Steve, absolutely brilliant, and you totally

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,440
did not expect it to come out now. But, man, you made a lot of people happy.

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Okay, so, so that was all cool, right? And, and I've always got my, my little ear buds with me,

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,440
so I didn't need to carry headphones, already had headphones for the airplane, because of course,

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:12,680
I flew the, um, the 182RG. We'll talk about that as well. Um, and I sit down and, you know,

36
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,600
and we totally prepared for this video iPod thing, because of course, um, if you look in your iTunes,

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,640
and you're using iTunes, if not, you can grab this off of the RSS feed, the podcast feed.

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,440
I put a nice little daily source code kind of, uh, trailer thingy in there. Um, and,

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,360
you know, we've been waiting for this moment to have that, you know, when you have all this,

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,600
you know, cool capability, uh, excuse me.

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,240
I heard you say it. I heard you say senseo. I heard you couldn't stop,

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,520
couldn't help but think about it, could you? Um, so we've been waiting for this moment. We've been

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,720
waiting for the, um, uh, for the video iPod, uh, and have some content for it, uh, and this is

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,000
going to be very interesting. Um, wow, man, I really did not expect this to happen right now.

45
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Glad we were prepared, but true. It even amazed me. I must say.

46
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,760
So this is where mainstream media will really get to play, and that's great. You know, um,

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,440
I've, uh, let's lots of TV shows and stuff I want to watch. I'm all for that.

48
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,400
Totally down with it. This is, you know, this is the Tvo capability of, uh, of what we've

49
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,600
discovered here. So that's pretty cool. Now, you know, um, we need more Steve Garfields, you know,

50
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,480
we need more. Kakyaos. Kakyao, my dear friend, the video wizard from the Netherlands who has made

51
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:46,520
me what I am today. And then I mentioned she's beautiful and so nice. Um,

52
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,160
so anyway, so yeah, I'm sorry. It's late. So I'm just trying to gather all my thoughts here. So,

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,760
um, I'm kind of thinking what I could do. All right. So let me get back to the problem at hand.

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,160
I like you really care about my thoughts there. Um, so I had everything all set up. I go to

55
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,200
record the source code. I've got mega-sag loaded, got all my software, uh, and I make the critical,

56
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,240
or I made the critical error that you can do all that, but you can't be reading and writing data

57
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,480
to a disk drive if it's on a firewire drive. So I'm basically, here I am asking my poor firewire

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,720
connection to pass data through of, uh, me recording, you know, so recording an MP3 file

59
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,240
direct to the disk at the same time, requesting files from that same disk. Dumb,

60
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,600
totally, just so incredibly stupid. So we can do a number of things. Uh, I'm thinking,

61
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,720
either I do some post, you know, because this is, you know, the cool thing about this of

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,360
court about podcasting is who cares, right, as long as we can, as long as we can hear something.

63
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,720
So what I'll do is, uh, we just, um, let's see, what I'll do, I'll do it with the old fashion

64
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,240
air bridge way. See, of course, you know, I got my love that even had new batteries and everything for,

65
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,080
for the, for the wireless microphone, new batteries. I'm recording on the I River now, by the way,

66
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,360
which, of course, is always the trusty backup. I almost thought to myself, right, when it

67
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,640
it pinched like this, it's time for a sound seeing tour. Uh, I don't like, man, it's Amsterdam.

68
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,440
It's like 12 o'clock. There's nothing going on. You know, it's, uh, it's a, it's a Wednesday night.

69
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,320
You know, things, uh, nothing happens in Amsterdam until probably at least two in the morning.

70
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,200
You know, and I got an early, an early call. So that's, uh, that's a, that's a no-go. Um,

71
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,600
so I was thinking maybe I should post edit the show and then everything you hear, uh, I'll kind of cross

72
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
over into the real sound file. I'll have to make that decision later. But first of all, for those of you

73
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,160
who didn't see the video, I'm just going to give you the sound of, of my little video, which is the first

74
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,160
kind of, you know, pod show vignette to run on the video iPod. If, uh, if you have one, and if not

75
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,320
certainly in iTunes 6, and I'm pretty sure this is going to work in iTunes 5 as well. Here, check it out.

76
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:39,080
Yeah, it's pretty cool. Room, uh, you don't get the full effect, of course, without actually seeing the video.

77
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,560
So I'm going to put that in as a separate piece of the feed. And, uh, let's see what we can do with this stuff.

78
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,880
Um, you know, Mads Weinstein videos have been showing up that she's been putting in her podcast

79
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,960
feed for a while now. Some of it's a pretty intense, definitely different there, Mads.

80
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,040
Okay, so, um, let's just talk about video iPod for a second because I was really blown away.

81
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, wait, the new iMac G5? Is that, uh, is that something that's new as well? That was announced today?

82
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,680
No, probably not. I think I have the new iMac G5, don't I? Okay. Yeah. I wonder is there a video available

83
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,360
of this? Did Steve do one of his famous, famous videos? Let me see.

84
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,600
Watch the new iPod ad, see the new iPod, and iTunes ad. Should we take a look at that?

85
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,480
Oh, Steve Jobs, the special web, I'm not going to watch the webcast with you. You don't want to do that.

86
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,960
I feel a lot like Mads Weinstein actually doing this. This is very much a, like a

87
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Mads thing, you know, just messing around with audio and play some stuff. Let me see.

88
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,880
Oh, did I get a 404? That's interesting. I said, I wanted to see the new iPod and iTunes ads. I click on that.

89
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,080
And then it gets the page you tried was not found. Oh, that's interesting. How about the new iPod?

90
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,080
Okay, that one works. Let's take a look at it.

91
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,720
Got your eyes open? The bandwidth here, the hotel, by the way, is actually pretty good.

92
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:14,440
Okay, so this is a, oh, man. iTunes plus iPod TV. Okay. Uh, iTunes plus iPod TV ad featuring YouTube.

93
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah. Okay, that was brilliant.

94
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,640
It's transferring from a server called metrics.apple.com. Oh, the cool. Now that Bono is in a little iPod.

95
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,800
Make sure not actual picture. You might see.

96
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,920
Pretty cool. Wow, man. I can't wait. The content. That's what it's about. That's what's going to be so

97
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,440
interesting. Let's see if we can find out more iTunes. I overview. I really should download the new

98
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,920
iTunes. We got some other stuff to do. And I want to actually download some stuff and play it for you.

99
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,760
So the question is, you know, what kind of content is going to drive this mainstream content

100
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,840
without a doubt? I think that's great. And depending on the length and the quality, you know,

101
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,680
these are why these codex are also important that everyone talks about. You know, because the

102
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,560
small of the file size, the less it costs to actually send this out across whatever delivery network,

103
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,600
you know, these are going to go out. And this is, I guess, just kind of like a straight HTTP download.

104
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,760
So that's going to be very interesting to see how the economics of that work. You can bet that there's

105
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,520
a huge spreadsheet of apple, man, a huge one. And they're looking at bandwidth costs and customer

106
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,520
acquisition costs. And they're looking at, you know, what does it cost to run all those

107
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,240
individual tracks through their system and the billing? And this is a, and of course, you know,

108
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,160
the sales of new iPods, but damn, I mean, I think really that they lock up everyone's brain

109
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,920
almost with this. They must have been working on these deals for a long, long time. I can't wait to

110
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,840
download this thing and check it out. All right, let me try a few promos here. I'm just pulling

111
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:25,880
straight from the Gmail box. So, you know, your results may vary. Do you enjoy great jazz music,

And this is a lot of good good jazz streaming stations. There's, there's still a lot of validity

116
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,040
to that. I like, you know, because I can't get the satellite stations. Unfortunately, I'd really wish I could

117
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,840
it would be, it would be really enjoyable to listen to. And of course, you know, our satellite TV

118
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,080
has all these stations, but I don't have it hooked into any stereo system. Kind of the drawback

119
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,080
of renting a house, you know, the cottage we're renting and we've kind of decided we're going to

120
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,560
actually we just had to decide we're going to stay there another year. We only do a year to year

121
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,880
least because we kind of want to figure out what we want to do. So, we're going to stay for at least

122
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,200
another year and then eventually, you know, I'd like to build the house of my dreams. But

123
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:48,840
that's for another podcast. So, this morning, ticker seen at a school horrible traffic.

124
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:55,160
Oh, man, there was a couple of cars overturned on the A3 motorway, actually on the inbound to

125
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,360
Gilford. And there's really only one main drag to get to Gilford and even if you go off the beaten

126
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,920
path, that that fills up with its seconds because it's so windy, twisty, you know, great English

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,160
countryside roads. And great for motoring. And so, you know, it's just the traffic was horrendous.

128
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,760
Christina was really late. We even called the school on our way and the school knew about it because

129
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,040
lots of kids were late. And Wind Commander William and actually one of Patricia's cardiologists

130
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:35,560
Eric Frittent, yeah. He's, he's also a FAA medical examiner and I had a medical test scheduled

131
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,600
with him in Antwerp this morning. And since William, the Wind Commander was bringing the

132
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,280
Cessna over from Antwerp to pick me up so I could fly it back with him. He brought Eric over,

133
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,320
his apartment is literally right at almost at the airport. And it's a great guy, 68 years old,

134
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,400
cardiologist, you know, really interesting guy, pilot for many, many years, just built his own

135
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,720
airplane. You know, it was kind of cool. But I was late for, you know, meeting them. But, you know,

136
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,120
they just had some breakfast, bangers and mash, of course. It's just like bigals, man. I'm telling

137
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,840
you, this Farrow's airport is just beautiful. It's exactly what you want from your

138
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:20,760
small English airfield. Hopped in the Sessna, off we were pretty cool. You can fly, we flew

139
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:30,200
it to flight level 5, 5, so 5, 500 feet. And in the UK, you can fly VFR, so visual flying rules above

140
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,000
the clouds. But we also did some IMC flying, so basically you're in the clouds, you're flying

141
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,120
on instruments. And that's where that kind of, you know, weird vertigo thing kicks in, which is

142
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,800
what instrument flying is all about, you know, is where you think you should be, you know,

143
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,360
leaning the plane towards the left, where really, you know, you could be in all kinds of attitudes.

144
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,640
And that's basically what happened to JF Kennedy Jr., you know, he got into weather where

145
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,520
that a lot of experience and freaked out on the instruments. And before you know it, you look

146
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,240
up at the sky and there's a sheep there, you know, except it's your upside down, you're about

147
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,480
to crash into the into the meadow. In this case, it would be a boat probably flying over the English

148
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,640
channel. So that worked out pretty well, actually, you know, and hadn't flown for what maybe

149
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,720
six weeks. So, you know, at the beginning, thereafter take off and William was doing the radio,

150
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,840
which really takes a lot of workload off of the pilot, obviously. You know, I was, I felt like

151
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
the plane was like a mile ahead of me, you know, I'm still doing everything. But then,

152
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,320
you know, as we kind of, I stabilized a bit and, you know, got to, got the hang of it again.

153
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,880
And, you know, remember, oh, yeah, small inputs on everything. And it was good. We were flying,

154
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,880
you know, and we were on the total control of London radar and telling us what to do. And it was,

155
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,120
yeah, it was a good trip, went to Antwerp, went over to Eric's place, got my physical, my medical

156
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,240
snive, the first class medical again, or an extension there of, so good for two years. And then

157
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,880
William and I went flying. And we went to mid-Azailant, which is in the middle of the Netherlands,

158
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:13,000
kind of lower middle, I would say, on the, on the sea. And that is actually the airport there,

159
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,200
is just a stone's throw from Cas Blaster Mike's place. And he had heard, I guess, yesterday on the

160
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,040
source code that I was going to be flying, he knows that I would sometimes do touch and goes there.

161
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,640
So he had sent me a message saying, hey, you know, let me know if you're going to be in the neighborhood.

162
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,640
I called him, I said, dude, we're definitely going to fly over. I'll do a couple of touching

163
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,080
goes and if you're there, we'll have some coffee. And, you know, the, so Cas Blaster Mike, who makes

164
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,960
the Cas Blaster application, he really, it's the whole development of that. I mean, the guys

165
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,880
really, quite brilliant at, at the software that he's put together and wait until you see this

166
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,880
next release where everything's done in software and, you know, the hardware is no longer

167
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,200
dependent and zero latency. I mean, it's just rocket science stuff to me at least as a user.

168
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,040
And boy, am I kicking myself that I chose to take the, uh, the power book, sorry about that,

169
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,840
and that I chose to take the power book instead of, uh, the craplet because I could have

170
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,520
happily done a great show on the on Cas Blaster. So, you know, in the continuing war of how

171
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,360
Mike is going to get me to use Cas Blaster all the time. I think I've learned my lesson here.

172
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,840
This really, this really bites him actually holding the love microphone here. It's like holding

173
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:31,240
onto a peanut in front of your face. You know, it looks dorky too. So, uh, there he was, Mike,

174
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,200
he wrote his bike over from his house and, uh, and he had his, you know, he's a ham radio operator,

175
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,800
of course, uh, and so he had his little, uh, receiver and he had been listening to us on the frequency

176
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,840
doing the touching goes. And, uh, and of course, uh, even though they only charge me for four,

177
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,280
I probably did about eight touching goes on one of the landings. But, uh, we got down walked away

178
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,480
safely, so it's all good. Uh, and I was cool to see Mike, you know, and then just hang out for a

179
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,600
little bit and had a quick bite to eat and then, um, I went off to the tower to pay for our

180
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,320
fuel and, uh, and for, uh, you know, the landing fees in Europe. You have to pay landing fees,

181
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,040
which is, you know, pretty weird for a US pilot to what won't really recognize that,

182
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,040
unless you're a transport pilot. Uh, I said, well, you know, William, why don't you take

183
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,960
Mike up? Now, Mike is never flown. Uh, I think he actually flew one song like, you know,

184
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,000
some city hopper type thing, but he did not like it. And he's, you know, uh, you know,

185
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,080
Mike's the kind of guy that will go to England on vacation and he'll drive, okay, and he'll take

186
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,800
the boat or the train and put the car on the train or whatever, but he doesn't fly. And I said,

187
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,360
well, man, you want to fly? And I want to, you know, I want to have a quick trip and, uh,

188
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,040
said, yeah, well, so you got to sit up front, you know, so that's, and of course, William was there.

189
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,440
So, so, but I'm not going to sit in the back. I'll go pay the bill and then, uh, you guys go fly, man.

190
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,680
I, that guy had a grin when he came out of that plane. Uh, I know that he's probably, you know,

191
00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:00,040
downloading a flight sim right now, you know, trying to, I want to fly some more. Uh, it is quite

192
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,120
addictive. Yeah, it's quite addictive. Um, okay, Doki, let me see. I had, uh, I did do the show prep.

193
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,000
It's just I couldn't load everything in the way I wanted to do it, obviously.

194
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,600
I got a hit test from, uh, from Yon Polette coming up. Uh, thank you very much, everyone who,

195
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,840
everyone who sent in, uh, the Unix command, man, this is so geeky. You know, I said that there's a

196
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:35,400
way that you can make programs on your Mac, uh, have more processing power assigned to it.

197
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,840
It's called the Nice Command, and I said, well, I think you can only start it up by typing Nice,

198
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,160
and then the, you know, the path of the application or whatever. You have to set a, a variable for how

199
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,880
nice you want it to, to be or how nice you want the system to be to that application. Um, oops,

200
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:59,880
no, someone's typing me, who's this? Okay, I don't know what's up with that.

201
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:11,480
Um, shoot, where was I? Oh, man, roll back the clock. Okay, uh, on the nice thing,

202
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,480
there you go, I can hear you yelling at me saying, about nice, okay, get on with the damn Unix talk.

203
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,560
Um, so you can actually re-knice a process, and I'm sure someone will be more than happy to put that

204
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:32,200
information in, uh, in the show notes for today. So you can, uh, figure out how to do that. It's, it's,

205
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,840
kind of, it's really, it's more advanced stuff, but it does kind of go to show. And that's what I really

206
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,720
like about my Mac is that you can do that kind of stuff. Um, man, you know, I, I don't have my,

207
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,680
uh, I don't have my, uh, my regular MP3 files with me either. I really messed this up. My pre-production

208
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:59,160
on this trip was absolutely horrible. Not to mention that it falls, um, in line with the, uh,

209
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,760
with the board meeting, and it's just like I did not want to be here. I really wanted to be back

210
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,800
in San Francisco for this week. So, okay, what we'll do while I look at some stuff and see if I can

211
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,520
find, uh, hold on, tell me I've lost that as well. Yeah, see if I can find some of these other

212
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:26,680
promos I lined up. Why don't we, oh, this is a good one, hold on. Oh, that's quite a difference between

213
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:33,080
the way I normally do it and what you're hearing right now. Yes, I have it. It's lined up. It's

214
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:41,720
Yonpula. Oh, yeah.

215
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,960
I am this is a new hit. It's this number 65 already and there is not much time. So if you don't mind,

216
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,840
we're going to start right away. Okay, this is number one.

217
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,200
Okay, that sounds to me like super tramp and I'm going to have to say look my girlfriend,

218
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,520
a breakfast in America. Number two.

219
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,920
It's like, it's like extra hard because I can't really hear it through the shitty sound. I give up on that one.

220
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:34,520
And the final one, number three. Come on, I need a word, ring my bell. I know the second one too.

221
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,560
I just got to hear it again and time's up.

222
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:52,680
This is the answer number one in today's hit. It's a song from 1989. It's super tramp.

223
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,560
This is super school. Oh, school.

224
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

225
00:23:39,560 --> 00:24:06,940
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh yeah oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh, no better than ever in the world.

226
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,940
I love the second floor

227
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,940
I love the second floor

228
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,940
Yes, I think you've seen me

229
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,940
You hear something, lady, baby

230
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,940
So, baby, baby, baby

231
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Just don't cry, baby

232
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Just don't cry, baby

233
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Just don't cry, baby

234
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,940
Enter number two, Susanne Fagas

235
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,940
And this is the third and final answer

236
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,940
Oh, baby, wonderful, I'm 1979

237
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Can you tell me what?

238
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Bring my bell

239
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
Remember this man, this was the jam

240
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,940
I know the great song this time from just to be 48 years

241
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,940
I need a ward

242
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,940
And rate my bell as a third and final answer

243
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,940
In hit test number 64

244
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,940
I need a ward

245
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,940
And rate my bell as a third and final answer

246
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,940
In hit test number 64

247
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:36,940
And this concludes this hit test

248
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,940
I hope you did well, Adam, I also hope you enjoyed this one as well

249
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Again, great music, lots of different kinds of music

250
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,940
To keep it a bit striking

251
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Okay, as always, feedback is welcome

252
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,940
It's a usual address hit test in gmail.com

253
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,940
And you can find some info at that usual place

254
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,940
www.yompolet.com

255
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Also, the iTunes links are to be found there

256
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,940
So please use these links if you've got advice and tricks

257
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,940
And then you've heard one of the hit test

258
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Well, thank you for listening until next time

259
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,940
Again, so getting the usual story at the end of the hit test

260
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,940
I don't know when the next one will be created

261
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,940
And will be played on a daily source code

262
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,940
So there will be an next time, so until then, bye-bye

263
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,940
You know, I think that we have safely established that

264
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,940
This air bridge audio link bites ass

265
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
This is no good

266
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,940
God, I was trying to position the microphone to get it

267
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,940
You know, sound a little less like sharp

268
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,940
Like cutting into my brain

269
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Because I'm wearing the earbud

270
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,940
So I'm wearing exactly what you're going to be hearing

271
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,940
When you look depending on what kind of earbud you have

272
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,940
Of course, oh my god, that was nasty

273
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,940
Okay, young, thank you very much though

274
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
It was nice about it

275
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,940
It did definitely get me in the mood

276
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,940
And it made me feel good, man, when I hear those tunes

277
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,940
Ah, it's the soundtrack to your life

278
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Flashing before your eyes, I need something to drink

279
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
Let me clip you on again, oops

280
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,940
That's right, I got to take everything with me

281
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Great

282
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,940
So for those of you who are listening to the daily source code

283
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,940
On serious satellite, kind of 103 serious stars

284
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,940
And thinking what the hell is this?

285
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,940
This is podcasting, it's a total mobile concept

286
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Not only on your end, but also on my end

287
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,940
I'm completely mobile, let's see what let's take a look

288
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,940
What do we have in the Amstel Hotel

289
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Mini bar

290
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,940
Well, let's see, we have a tubalaron

291
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
Oh, that's Don's Favorite

292
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,940
Don does nasty stuff with tubalaron

293
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,940
I don't want to say that

294
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,940
And we have a very chic, very nice actually

295
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,940
Body opener

296
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,940
Beer can opener, nice knife

297
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,940
It's almost like a full leather than there

298
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,940
We have Coke classic Coke light

299
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Two of those, smear enough typical stuff

300
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,940
I was like to look at the juices, you know

301
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,940
So they have German juice

302
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,940
Made from fresh Germans

303
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Fyinger, orange and soft

304
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,940
Nehobens fyinger

305
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,940
So that's orange juice, so we have

306
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
What do you mean?

307
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
Team flushed in soft, full soft

308
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,940
Multivitamin

309
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,940
Ten, full juices

310
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,940
And there's a two-latten soft

311
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,940
And another round of the soft

312
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,940
And we have Americano, Pringles, original and paprika

313
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,940
And we have a very expensive looking nut

314
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,940
And by the way, if you sometimes live from many bars like I do

315
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,940
You soon learn that the nuts are

316
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Outradiously expensive

317
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,940
It's just nuts

318
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,940
It's exactly what it is

319
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,940
Got myself some Pringles and got myself some

320
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,940
Evian here

321
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,940
Okay, so anyway, and by the way, I'm sorry about yesterday

322
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,940
I just didn't work out having

323
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Just couldn't do the source code

324
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Literally, you know, with

325
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,940
By the time we were done flying

326
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,940
I mean, look at the quality of the problem, right?

327
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Check this out

328
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
And if you had the munchies right now

329
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,940
Do you be going like, man

330
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,940
Dude's got some Pringles

331
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Then we went from Midasiland to Hilversum

332
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,940
The Hollywood of the Netherlands, that's where they have an airport

333
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,940
Grassfield, but which is really convenient

334
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,940
Because you can, it's basically the same distance from

335
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Skipple airport with all the traffic

336
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,940
Certainly that time of day, which is the main airport

337
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,940
You can land there, you can land

338
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,940
I'm just grabbing right there

339
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,940
You can land there, that's general aviation

340
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,940
There we go

341
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,940
But Hilversum is a lot more fun, because you can't

342
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,940
You probably aren't going to get a lot of permission

343
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,940
Do touching goes at Skipple Airport

344
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,940
But you can do lots of touching goes at

345
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,940
At Hilversum

346
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,940
And that's a couple of those

347
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,940
And then they have a little clubhouse

348
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,940
They're restaurant, so had a beer, waited for

349
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,940
Taxi Erics guide to come pick me up

350
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,940
And take me to the hotel

351
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,940
So really, but you know, with the hour that you lose

352
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
And time difference

353
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Are really, it didn't get into the hotel

354
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,940
Until like quarter eight in the my room

355
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
Of course, my reservation hadn't gone through

356
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,940
Expedia, of course

357
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
You know, you'll always see that happen, right?

358
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
So I had to figure all of that out, and that just

359
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Yeah, it was a bit of a pain

360
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,940
And then hopped on the Skype, I've called home

361
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,940
I've spoke a great length to one of my dear friends

362
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,940
It's funny, because it was not really funny, but I'm here

363
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,940
And spoke to her, and she lives in the Netherlands

364
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,940
But we actually had our whole conversation on Skype, which was kind of trippy

365
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,940
Kind of strange

366
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,940
Excuse me

367
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Right, so

368
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,940
We have at Pod Show

369
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,940
We have meetings

370
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,940
The meetings is more like kind of like

371
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,940
We all get together, and we certainly can do it now in the configuration of the company

372
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,940
You know, we don't have too many people before it gets a little overbearing

373
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,940
People just, you know, and we have one big open space, so it's real cool

374
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,940
So we all kind of, you know, get together

375
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:07,940
It's either a business meeting or a technology meeting

376
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,940
And you know, everyone will present what they're working on

377
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,940
A lot of, a lot of been over here, obviously I'd dial in

378
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,940
And we do a video actually just use eye chat, and that works really well

379
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,940
And I got to tell you

380
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,940
We got some smart, some smart people doing some really interesting stuff

381
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,940
Taking, you know, the whole idea of podcasting and what you can do with it

382
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,940
To places that I just never thought of, although

383
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,940
Actually places that I have kind of been bumping into here and there

384
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,940
Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about

385
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,940
Do you remember that, the promo I played the other day for the

386
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,940
Mary and who was her name?

387
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,940
Let me go to my show notes, that's where I'll be able to find it

388
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,940
Hold on a second

389
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,940
I might even have it, no, I don't have it in my browser history

390
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,940
Okay, okay, let me just go to the daily source code wiki

391
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
It's gonna tell me that immediately

392
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,940
So these two 20 year old girls get to the name in a second

393
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,940
And I guess 20 something or whatever

394
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,940
And what's really cool is that they do a podcast and they do it on a Mac

395
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,940
Well, how do I know that? Well, because they also recorded on video

396
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,940
And they put that or they have a separate feed for that

397
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,940
And it was like, wow, you know, that's pretty cool

398
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,940
But what was going on was was actually more interesting

399
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,940
They were commenting on another podcast, which they were playing back

400
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,940
And stopping at intervals and laughing about, oh, here it is

401
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,940
Of course, Mary and Carla show, I'm sorry, Mary and Carla dot com

402
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:00,940
And you know, and I was kind of being a warrior of warrior

403
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Looking in on, even though they sometimes were talking to me as the listener

404
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,940
And actually to the camera at some points, which was even

405
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,940
Trippier to see

406
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,940
And it was kind of like they were having this, you know, this

407
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,940
Conversation with like four people, the two of them and these two other guys

408
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,940
And they were actually playing that snippets of their show

409
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
And I was like, wow, you know, this is like

410
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,940
It's kind of like a hyper linking type of thing

411
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,940
Although no one else can follow it, which is a bummer

412
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,940
But you can kind of understand the thread, you know

413
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,940
And you just jump into it and they've done nine or ten shows or something

414
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,940
So I kind of fell into them into full steam

415
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,940
And I guess this feud or whatever, you know, it's kind of

416
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,940
Dissing back and forth and it's interesting

417
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,940
It really is

418
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,940
And I've seen some really interesting behavior and tagging

419
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:00,940
That is really in my mind is saying that podcasting is going to be more than

420
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,940
And of course this is no secret, right?

421
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,940
We always knew that, you know, you could have

422
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,940
You could do a podcast like a radio show or

423
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,940
It can be a book, you know, look at Scott Sigler or it can be

424
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,940
You know, an exercise, work out routine, you know, like

425
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,940
Marina's podcast, you know, it can be so many different things

426
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,940
And even I often without a doubt get stuck in the idea of

427
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,940
You know, it's going to be one, there's going to be a show and

428
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,940
You know, go to many people or a set number of people

429
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Or maybe to know people and you have advertising

430
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,940
You don't have advertising and what is advertising?

431
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
You know, an advertising can be podcasts

432
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,940
I mean, when you start to really step back a little bit and see

433
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,940
What people are doing online and how they're using applications

434
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,940
And how they're using instant messaging and how they're using voice over

435
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,940
IP and I think that this is a part of it and it fits into a

436
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,940
much bigger puzzle that in a way Apple is trying to figure out

437
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,940
If I, and I was actually, I did just look at the

438
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:12,940
At the Apple page for it goes a little bit further

439
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Yeah, so it's the iTunes page, right?

440
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,940
Now, of course, what Apple has always done has

441
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,940
Work this concept of eye life where, you know, your photos

442
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,940
And your music go together and so it was photos music and then

443
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,940
But what else do they have?

444
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,940
A movie, of course, with eye movie

445
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,940
And, you know, what happened is it turns out that

446
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,940
Really having one, one piece of software and

447
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,940
Clearly one device takes care a lot of a lot of your

448
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,940
entertainment necessities.

449
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,940
There's my eye count telling me something here.

450
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,940
So, you know, the, the iPod does photos,

451
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Items does photos, does music, does video.

452
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,940
So it's all kind of coming into one device.

453
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,940
And if you look at the iPod economy of all the add-ons and

454
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,940
Snap-ons and plug-ins that you can buy for the iPod,

455
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,940
I mean, it's becoming a pretty pretty interesting little box.

456
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
And of course, it's beautiful, which is nice.

457
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Now, that's not to say that there aren't tons of great other

458
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,940
Devices out there running an open source platform, etc.

459
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,940
But, you know, it's a beautiful device.

460
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,940
I just can't help but say, you know, I like beautiful things

461
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,940
It looks really nice and seems to be affordable.

462
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,940
So, just like what Apple is doing with, you know,

463
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,940
With this integration of all these different things.

464
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,940
So, too, does podcasting and video casting have a place, you know?

465
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
And I just, I got to think about it.

466
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,940
This video thing is, like, it's so intriguing to me.

467
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,940
There's so many different things you can do.

468
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,940
And, you know, how many content creators are there?

469
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,940
And is there a simple type of content creation,

470
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,940
Which can be, you know, for video, which is easy as plugging in a microphone

471
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,940
Into an eye-rever and then uploading the file, you know,

472
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,940
And holding a microphone in front of the speaker and doing that kind of stuff.

473
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,940
You know, is there going to be an equivalent to that in video?

474
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,940
And is there going to be entertaining?

475
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,940
Will it draw an audience?

476
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,940
I must say that somehow short videos do it for me.

477
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,940
Sure, either a music video, which I like, but, you know,

478
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,940
If it's like a performance, what we did MTV, we used to call up a performance piece

479
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
Where people are dancing or whatever.

480
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,940
That's not really going to work on the small screen.

481
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
So they have great examples here.

482
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Actually, I can see on the page, Bono up close,

483
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,940
Singing Madonna with her Vogue, and her Vogue stands.

484
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Okay, so that's going to work, you know,

485
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,940
But, oh, in the complete Stevie Wonder digital box set is also out.

486
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Oh, man.

487
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,940
Oh, man.

488
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,940
I bet Steve Jobs announced that today as well.

489
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,940
Hold on a second.

490
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Let's see.

491
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,940
Oh, man.

492
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,940
You know, I'm such a Stevie Wonder fan.

493
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Let me see.

494
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,940
I'm accessing requests could not be.

495
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,940
Not currently not available in the Dutch store,

496
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,940
But it is available in the US store.

497
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,940
Click Change Store to view this item.

498
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,940
Oh.

499
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,940
I can view it, but I can't buy it.

500
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
Oh, okay.

501
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,940
So the rights haven't been cleared for the Netherlands yet,

502
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,940
Or the European Union.

503
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,940
189 bucks.

504
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,940
The complete Stevie Wonder.

505
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,940
That's what it's called.

506
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,940
The complete Stevie Wonder.

507
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
Wow.

508
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,940
That looks good.

509
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,940
Okay.

510
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
See?

511
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,940
Already it's working, right?

512
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,940
You just saw me get marketed to.

513
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,940
I was looking at something completely else.

514
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,940
So Stevie Wonder, I clicked on them.

515
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,940
Unfortunately, they can't give it to me because I'm in the wrong country.

516
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,940
And that's not.

517
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,940
It's not that iTunes knows that I'm in the Netherlands, by the way.

518
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,940
I've just had my, my Mac account that long.

519
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,940
It's still on my, my Dutch credit card and my,

520
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,940
Actually, my Dutch address.

521
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,940
Which I don't own anymore.

522
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,940
Fantastic.

523
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,940
Okay.

524
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:17,940
So that's what I've been getting from these updates with the, with the team.

525
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,940
And it's great because we're also getting to know each other.

526
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,940
And, and we're sparring with each other, which is,

527
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,940
Oh, man.

528
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,940
Have I longed to do that again with smart people and,

529
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,940
You know, talk about concepts and,

530
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,940
And we had, well, this was great.

531
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,940
We had Andrew Grumman out for a couple days.

532
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,940
Andrew Grumman, of course.

533
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Well known from all of his development work on iPod or lemon.

534
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,940
He's been there from almost day one with the,

535
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,940
You know, after this whole thing kind of got started.

536
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,940
Definitely pretty.

537
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Well, shoot, I was talking with,

538
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,940
In fact, Andrew was in Amsterdam with Dave Winner as funny,

539
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,940
because I remember describing to him distinctly.

540
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,940
I bet he'll remember this.

541
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
And sometimes Andrew does a podcast.

542
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,940
And I'd love to hear his recollection of this.

543
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,940
We were in Amsterdam.

544
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,940
I still had the, the bunker.

545
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,940
And so we hung out there for a little bit.

546
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,940
They weren't traveling together,

547
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,940
But I think maybe Dave invited Andrew over.

548
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,940
I can't quite remember how that went.

549
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,940
But we were, and this is, you know,

550
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,940
There was no podcast in there.

551
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
I hadn't written any script,

552
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,940
But there was all kinds of things floating around that

553
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,940
I remember saying what I want.

554
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,940
Because remember now,

555
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,940
I built the first iPod or script,

556
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,940
Because I couldn't get anyone to do this.

557
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
And I was explained it well.

558
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
But I said to Andrew, I said,

559
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I really want, like,

560
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,940
Black hole, you know,

561
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
I want to, you, you,

562
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,940
If you make an MP3 file,

563
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,940
We're even thinking about how you do that them.

564
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,940
But you just drag it into this hole on your desktop.

565
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,940
And it goes away.

566
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
And anyone who's subscribed to it,

567
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,940
They can pick it up.

568
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,940
And I want a place where the stuff comes in.

569
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,940
And I want to go straight to my iPod.

570
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,940
And so as basically describing the functionality of iPod,

571
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,940
Or an aggregator, of course,

572
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,940
Which I didn't come up with.

573
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,940
But an aggregator with enclosures.

574
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
But, you know, the whole experience.

575
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,940
That's what it's about for me.

576
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,940
It's going through to the,

577
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,940
All the way through to my, at that time, iPod.

578
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,940
Funny.

579
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,940
I just remember something else we talked about in that conversation.

580
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,940
That, and this is probably, you know,

581
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,940
This is, here's a place where the iPod,

582
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
What is it called?

583
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
Is it called an iPod?

584
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
Does it have a separate sub name?

585
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
Like the iPod Nano?

586
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,940
Does it have any?

587
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
Was it just the iPod?

588
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,940
The iPod?

589
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,940
Hmm.

590
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,940
It just says the new iPod.

591
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,940
Okay.

592
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
Poorne.

593
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,940
Poorne is going to be huge.

594
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,940
Huge.

595
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,940
I, you know, the porn guys are just going,

596
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,940
Holy moly.

597
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,940
And, you know, what I believe in two personal porn.

598
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,940
I think that's, that's definitely going to happen.

599
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,940
It is.

600
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,940
And, isn't it time for a hot or not application on your iPod,

601
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,940
By the way, don't we need that?

602
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,940
I mean, video dating, subscribe to the video dating feed.

603
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,940
Oh, man.

604
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,940
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that's going to be cool.

605
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,940
And, you know, and that to me is also a version of podcasting.

606
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,940
I think it's just, it is much broader.

607
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,940
And, by the way, it doesn't mean that it's, you know,

608
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,940
that there's any less love or, or more or whatever.

609
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,940
It's just, you know, we're only beginning to understand the massive changes

610
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,940
that are taking place in, in our media landscape.

611
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,940
And, actually, not even doing the source code today.

612
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,940
And, just, you know, flying and taking my mind off it.

613
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,940
When I, when I was done flying, it's just, it's like a whole bunch of stuff

614
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,940
myself out.

615
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,940
I didn't even know about the release of the, of the new iPod yet.

616
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,940
But, you know, we're seeing something very different,

617
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,940
which is going to affect a lot.

618
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,940
We've talked about this, what's happening with music.

619
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,940
This is very much like another evolution of music.

620
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,940
And, I guess if you look back at it,

621
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,940
the stages of, you know, of types of music,

622
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,940
pretty much always go hand in hand with the technological

623
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:20,940
innovation of some sort.

624
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,940
Okay, I don't know all of them, but let's take the 60s.

625
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,940
A lot of it was based on distortion.

626
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,940
You know, I'm sure that there were some parents saying,

627
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,940
how can you listen to that crap?

628
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,940
Look, it's over-modulated, the guitar, and what is that sound?

629
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,940
That's a guitar?

630
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,940
It sounds like a cat screaming.

631
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,940
That's right.

632
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,940
I see electric guitar, baby.

633
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,940
Papa.

634
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,940
Daddy-o.

635
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:56,940
And then, of course, we had synthesizers brought us disco, new wave.

636
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,940
And, by the way, it was cool then.

637
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,940
And we just heard Anita Ward ring my bell.

638
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,940
That works for me, still.

639
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,940
Then, what do we have after that?

640
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,940
Well, remember, the Fair Light God Braun should be a part of this podcast.

641
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,940
I think he had one of the only ones in weight.

642
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,940
Was that the Fair Light?

643
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,940
Or do you have something pre- Fair Light?

644
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,940
Actually, 10CC started doing samples.

645
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,940
Was that thing called the melatron or something like that?

646
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,940
They had loops of tape, and you hit the tape, and the sampled play on the

647
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,940
actual loop of recording tape.

648
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,940
And that really spawned all new types of music and sounds.

649
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:43,940
I remember when everyone would be jealous, because it was always Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson,

650
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,940
who would get the new DX7 keyboard, which had samples in it.

651
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,940
They would be the first ones to cut a record using the samples that were built inside the keyboard.

652
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,940
So, all of that goes hand in hand with technological revolution.

653
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:05,940
And also the distribution of it, along with that came AM radio, FM radio, MTV, which of course,

654
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:13,940
meant cable, satellite, and it really affects how everything comes together.

655
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:20,940
And I guess it was kind of foolish not to think that radio wouldn't have to come along in some fashion.

656
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,940
And what is it going to be?

657
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,940
Maybe more questions asked than answered in this particular daily source code.

658
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,940
But I'm really happy.

659
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,940
I'm happy about what I'm seeing.

660
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,940
This just opens up.

661
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,940
Seeing it actually seeing this video iPod system, we're on the right track.

662
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:43,940
And I think you all know those of you that are clued in, those of you who are starting to see it,

663
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,940
I mean, PDF casting, yeah, that could happen too.

664
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:55,940
I mean, our version of media and what it means to us and how we consume it and how we make it is changing.

665
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,940
Check out the Mary and Carla.

666
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,940
See if you can get that video, the video cast.

667
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,940
Look at how they're using the computer.

668
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,940
And I don't want to feel that girls like you're being over-analyzed, but I just love it.

669
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,940
I look at my daughter, 15.

670
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:17,940
And I see how she's using the tools that we're created with entirely different purposes in mind.

671
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,940
And they're being used for very interesting purposes.

672
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,940
Particularly that webcam shit parents.

673
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,940
You got to make sure you know what your kid's doing with a damn webcam, okay?

674
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,940
Wow.

676
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,940
Okay.

677
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:44,940
So we've almost gotten through the time that I wanted to spend today and everything that I think just about everything I want to talk about, kind of a free form flow of ideas with a little bit of classical music in the background.

678
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,940
I hope that came through.

679
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,940
I apologize for the sound quality and for the lack of, you know, the usual bits and bits.

680
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:58,940
But sometimes it's kind of refreshing just to just to, you know, do something different and get it all off, just get it all off it all off of my mind.

681
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,940
Just a brain dump on you.

682
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,940
I hope you don't, I hope you don't mind.

683
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,940
So tomorrow, court crap.

684
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,940
And this will be the podcast for Thursday.

685
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,940
As I said, it is technically Thursday here.

686
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,940
And then I'll be back at the cottage.

687
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,940
My sister is arriving tomorrow at the cottage.

688
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,940
So that'll be fun, Tiffany.

689
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:26,940
I hope I can get on the podcast, which will be the thank God of Friday edition of the daily source code.

690
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:41,940

693
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,940

Talk to you Friday, everybody.

698

Bye-bye.
