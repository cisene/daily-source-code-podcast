1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
Hey everybody, it is Friday, May 6, 2005.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,400
Coming to you from Curry Cottage, a special Friday edition of the Daily Source Code, with a...

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,040
I don't know where my guest go, my guest has removed himself from the studio chair.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,560
Oh yeah, we've set it up as a studio, it almost looks like one and makes me sound better than the guest.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,120
Oh yeah, look, I have one good microphone and then I have the other one, which is a radio

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
shack, Mike, you know.

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,120
And guests who get the microphone.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,160
This is my special guest, Steve Leeds, we've talked about him lots before on the Daily Source

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,280
Code and certainly several times during the MTV Chronicles that I do with Ken Clark.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,400
And Steve is in town visiting and I was able to convince him to hop on a train and come

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,520
down to Lovely Gilford to the cottage to see the wife, kiss the baby who'll be here after school,

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,480
and to talk about, I don't know, radio, records, stuff like that.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,480
So now it's going to be really hard, Steve, because this is your first podcast, I think.

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
With a crummy microphone.

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
Oh come on, let me boost the volume a little bit there, say something.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,720
I noticed the resonance on the host's microphone as opposed to the guest,

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,600
usually the guest is supposed to be treated better than the host.

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,560
Yeah, but that's not the way.

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Why have you ever watched the Letterman or Lennon, don't you see that they get like the microphone

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,000
on the desk and they get the chair that's a little bit hot, well, Letterman doesn't need that,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
but Lennon gets his chairs a little higher and stuff like that, you never noticed that.

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,200
I mean, this microphone is really weird because it got, uh, maybe that's just the headphones you're wearing.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
Doesn't sound that bad here.

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,640
I mean, the microphone has these faults in it because they're so often, oh, really?

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
Oh, I don't feel that.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm, hey.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
Yeah, that's just you mucking around, stop doing that.

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,760
So, Steve is actually in the, almost like, my position myself a little bit,

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,040
or Steve is in the big green thing today, and uh, I'm over by the controls.

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,840
I've got the sensei of standing by, Steve, okay, I know you're going to be silly for like the

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,320
first 10 minutes because, you know, it's just because you're not used to it.

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,280
Oh, I like the green thing.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,560
So, uh, Steve is, um, without a, without a doubt, a legend in New York,

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,000
radio and music, and probably far beyond, but, you know, New York is like,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,240
anywhere you go, anyone you speak to, everybody knows Steve leads.

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,400
Now, you can just post a cough into the mic on the podcast.

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,480
Actually, yeah, thank you.

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,440
What was that?

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,280
What happened?

40
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,080
I took control.

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,600
You just blew the mic out. Did you hear that?

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
No. Yeah, no, it sounds much better.

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,280
I'm telling you, the microphone cleared its throat.

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,040
It's like the, wait, but not on here myself. Hold on, where am I?

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
I'm over here, now you say something.

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
I'm over here.

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm telling you, the mic, what's, did you hear that, the difference?

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,760
It cleared its throat.

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,120
That's amazing.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,440
Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,400
Thank you very much. See, I was wondering, I thought that radio shack might really

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,720
sounds like shit. I'm embarrassed about it, but,

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,320
yeah, but you get the windscreen.

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,280
No, you got a windscreen. There we go. Now, see, this is much better.

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,160
Okay, hold on.

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,520
Let me just turn you down a bit there.

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,960
Perfect. Okay. Thank you.

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
No, thank you. Thank you.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's much appreciated. Okay.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,160
So, I first heard of Steve Leads in,

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,120
I'm going to say it was about this time. No, no, no, no, it was,

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,680
when was it, Steve? It was, uh, back in the,

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,720
it was 1987, I think. 87.

64
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,080
Yeah, but it was, you were at Radio Veronica.

65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah, and I got a call at the desk downstairs.

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,080
Actually, I was walking up to my desk in the reception and I said, oh,

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,120
there's a call for you.

68
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,320
And, uh, so I took it and it was this guy, Steve Leads.

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,120
And I think we had a, like, a five-minute conversation.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,400
Yes. You said, hey, you want to come and work for us at MTV in America?

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
Would you be interested in coming to New York and working for MTV?

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,360
And what did I say? Actually, I'm an American,

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,760
I'm transplanted over here in Holland. That would be

74
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,440
not such a terrible thing. Yeah.

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,240
And you were interested. Yeah, that's right.

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,280
And we had the deal done in, like, two weeks?

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,560
Yeah, it was fast. And that your, your representative did a fine job,

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,960
but he was talking to the time with Lee Masters.

79
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,480
Oh, that's right. Lee Masters. Yeah.

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,040
A-K-A-Y-R-O-Mone. Who?

81
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,920
His real name is Y-R-O-Mone. No way.

82
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,040
Lee Masters isn't his real name? I didn't know that.

83
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,840
Well, is Adam Curry real name? Yes, that's my real name.

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,480
That's not a stage name? No, you know, come on. You know that.

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
You know, that's my real name. Okay. Yeah, you know, you know, I thought your last name was Bloom.

86
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,440
Yeah, right. Oh, how you doing? Y'all?

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,080
Y'all? Shalom? Shalom? It's Adam Bloom here.

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
And so that's the way we first met. Now, how did that work, Steve?

89
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
I don't think it would actually ask you how that came here there.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Lots of people claim claim that they brought me to MTV,

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,320
but I know you're the guy that called me, so.

92
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,680
Um, Steve Lieber of the famous Lieber Krebs.

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,760
Lieber Krebs? Aerosmith Management.

94
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,120
ACDC, Bellamy Brothers, Def Leopard.

95
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,800
Steve Lieber had shown me a video tape of Adam and said,

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
here's your next VJ.

97
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,960
And I said, okay, that's nice, but my relationship with Steve had always been very

98
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,400
one-sided. And so I kind of didn't follow through.

99
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,560
And then I was reading Media Week, which was an international music trade,

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,880
and there was a picture in Media Week? Yes, a view with doing some interview on Radio Veronica.

101
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,280
Really? And there was the in the American Media Week?

102
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
No, no, no, no, no, no. It was the, it was the European sort of billboard.

103
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,200
Oh, no, that was music and media. Music and media?

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,600
That's it. That's it, that's it.

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
T-O-Rose, who owns all the Genesis publishing. That's guy.

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
Ah, really? I owe him a thanks then.

107
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,840
Yeah, so there was your picture, and it had Radio Veronica.

108
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,880
And I went, you know what? I just want to call this guy out.

109
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,040
And so somehow I fomphered my way through the international codes,

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,840
the directory assistance, got the phone number for Radio Veronica.

111
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,600
And I think the first time I left the message for you with the switchboard.

112
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,440
Yeah, that's possible. And then the second time I got the switch,

113
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
that switchboard when the call came in. Right.

114
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,920
So that's how that happened. Is that you were me feeding back? I can't quite tell.

115
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,960
Well, I've lowered my cans. Okay. He just used me.

116
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,280
You're such a professional baby. I love it.

117
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,360
That's probably me. So yeah, and that started.

118
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,320
By the way, his cans today are white.

119
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,080
Very sexy. All of the iPod cans. What yours are mine? Yours. Yeah, well, these are actually my,

120
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
I can't stand. There's no atom. His very sexy cans.

121
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,240
My creative labs headphones. You know, can you buy replacement iPod headphones at the Apple

122
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,000
store? Have you tried that? That's a good question. I'm sure you can. I mean, you should be able to.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,280
One would think. Yeah, because they probably wouldn't allow that because then people could have other MP3 players.

124
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
I have an iPod. I don't like having headphones.

125
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
So you actually have the the white ones, which are the creative labs. So they kind of look like iPod

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,200
headphones, but they aren't really. And I don't use them on my iPod. Now they're using them on the

127
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,760
I River. Now they are telling people in New York City if you take the subway, do not use your iPod

128
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,360
headphones. They were just saying that last week when we were there. Cellphones and iPods, right?

129
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,440
That's what gets ripped off the most. But the dead giveaway is white, wired earphones.

130
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,040
You hear Patricia Latham? Yes, things are really rocking here today to carry out your boyfriend finally showed up.

131
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,000
So Steve, tell us just one. Tell us a little bit about your background. And then I want to talk

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,640
about, you know, because you were here for the cream concert. I was talking about it. I was talking about it.

133
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:56,960
Small. I had a roommate in college and we shared a room in the dormitory and he preferred to have

134
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,560
his girlfriend come over and spend Friday nights with him rather than me. And I wonder why that is.

135
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,400
So I had no place to go. You know, the old tie was hung on the door knob. Oh, that was the signal.

136
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,320
That was the signal like we're getting busy. So I wandered over to the campus radio station

137
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,200
and no one else was stupid enough on a Friday night to want to rip and read news. Back then,

138
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,440
you had a news tell a type. Right. Right. I came off the wall. Back in the old. Back in the old.

139
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,560
That's the wire, baby. That's right. The wire. As opposed to the source. To what school was this?

140
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,920
That was a American University in Washington, D.C. in Asia's capital.

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,120
Okay. So that's how you got, so you got to Friday night shift on the...

142
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,800
Well, that eventually was said way into becoming a disjockey there.

143
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,640
And eventually worn my way up from music director to station manager in my senior year.

144
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,960
On the same time, I produced foreign language broadcast in Arabic and in Vietnamese and Cambodian

145
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,400
for the U.S. Information Agency. So I had a low level government. You're like a spook man?

146
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:09,360
Yes. I was. Cool. I was. And then I applied for a job as a golfer production assistant for

147
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,280
New York legendary radio district. He Murray the K. Murray the K. He broke thousands of

148
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,920
acts. Didn't he wasn't he the the man to go to back in the day? Yes. He was the end of his heyday then.

149
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,760
This was when he moved down to D.C. and decided to sort of go into a slower lifestyle.

150
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,480
He worked at a adult contemporary station in Silver Spring, Maryland. And he wanted somebody to help him

151
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,560
program the Bobby Gullsboro records. What do you mean program the Bobby Gullsboro records? What does that mean?

152
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,680
Well, he was allowed to program his show within the constraints of the format. So he needed somebody to

153
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,600
put together the playlists. Oh, you're just saying Bobby Gullsboro is an example of the whole station.

154
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,160
Yes, that would be yes. That's really cool because that's a talent that that fewer people have

155
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,920
because it's all relegated down to automated systems like selector and profit and it comes off of playlists.

156
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,840
It's kind of a science consultants tell you what to what to play and when to play it, right?

157
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,160
Right. And at the time there was a program director there and a music director.

158
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,240
But Marie they said, you know, you're going to do after noon drive. And okay, you got this guy here and he can

159
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,480
help you out. And of course, we opened up with the obligatory Frank Sinatra record every day.

160
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,320
And Marie taught me a lot. He taught me a lot about the business. I mean, he was he was the guy and

161
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,000
he was the man and he brought me to with him to New York at the time. He was doing syndicated radio

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,160
on weekends for the NBC radio network was called Monde. Oh, I remember that. Sure.

163
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,240
And then that's segue into a special weekend.

164
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,520
Marie the K's New York on WNB WNB and NBC and that eventually led to a full-time gig. And so

165
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,400
summer after my senior year, I was working with him there.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,320
And that was Marie the K on drugs and strung out like a typical DJ and it's no, I like no, he was it was

167
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,840
funny. I probably in responsible for turning on to his first marriage of Anna. No, Steve, you

168
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:15,920
don't say you don't you don't smoke the holy herb. No, I don't. But I anymore. And no, it was funny.

169
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,200
He was on President Nixon's anti drug council. So, and he was smoking, though.

170
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,080
Yeah, that's great. Yeah, it was it was it was wild. He was with a moved in to DC with his

171
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:38,640
hot young woman model down there who was much younger than he and he was was the tie on the door

172
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:49,120
knob there too. Oh, I'm sure it was. And he left WWDCA and bought afternoons drives at WHFS.

173
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,760
Let me bought. They sold in the four-hour block. Really? Yes. Oh, that sounds like an atom curry move.

174
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,680
And he was allowed to do it every one that four hours and sold his own advertising.

175
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,880
Excellent. Excellent. And I became then his real full-time producer and my roommate at the time

176
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,520
became his board engineer. Okay. And we had a lot of fun. We started up a bit. It was a little

177
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,200
incongruous with the rest of the station sound because Marie would play hits. Now, this was early,

178
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,600
this must have been early 80s or even 70s. This is early 70s. Early 70s. Oh, this is 71.

179
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,280
How old are you now, Steve? 48? Um, you know, oh no, no, it's actually maybe 51 something like that.

180
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I'm a child of the 50s. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Later.

181
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,520
Child of the 50s. Yeah. Patricia's 49. So, you got your younger than she. Number nine. Yeah. Number nine.

182
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,560
Number nine. So, the time it must have been crazy in the record business because this was the

183
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,480
beginning of really FM radio. Right. And what was the vibe about FM radio when it just started?

184
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,160
What were people saying about it? Because I've heard stories, but was it really analogous to what

185
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,040
we're, you know, what we've seen. It was, it was called free form progressive radio. And you could be

186
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,920
as loose or as open as you wanted to. And you do things. I remember I then did the overnight

187
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,640
CWHFS. And I remember one night, station broadcast in stereo. Actually, WHFS brought it.

188
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,560
That was, it was a quad. That was, oh, quad sure. Yeah. So, you had to read your own transmitter

189
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,640
engineers. You had to have your third class license and all that. Yeah. And there was a red button

190
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,040
you pushed. If you were going to play music more than a certain length, it was in mono.

191
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,640
Because you weren't allowed to have the stereo generator on. If you were broadcasting a mono, it was

192
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,280
as an FCC regulation. It's just like that. So I'd go, okay. Now, I'm inside your receiver right now.

193
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,680
Right. Left speaker. Okay. Now, watch this. That little red dot on your stereo system.

194
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,840
It's about to come on. It's going to go off. Oh, my god. I can troll you radio.

195
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,720
What used to do stupid messed up stuff like that? You know, and if you didn't feel like,

196
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,680
you know, segueing records, then it was records. Put on the side of Bob Dylan, you know,

197
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,800
sad-eyed lady of the low land, which went on for low land. 14 minutes. It was more like 20. Really.

198
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,160
Or play a side of John Lennon and the mother's invention at the film more. You know, doing scumbag,

199
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,560
which went on for, wasn't it, Frank's app on the mother's invention? No, but it was John Lennon

200
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,400
from live piece in New York. Oh, okay. So that's before my time, man. That's okay. That's okay.

201
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,240
So, you know, you could anything went? You know, what was AM radio doing?

202
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,600
Were they tightly formatted? Were they doing news and music as well? Well, still the bigger stations were

203
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,760
in DC at the time the big station was weamed 1390. The weamed team red coats, the big 1390.

204
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,920
Everybody. Good afternoon. So still, it was a transition. Don't we hear a team?

205
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,320
If you were an audio file, you had this great Mac daddy stereo system with the gold, gold plugs,

206
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,240
gold connectors. No, those, no, that was pre-gold. Yeah, it was just one one. Yeah,

207
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,920
if you're KLH speakers. Oh, that was the shit. That was the state of the art. You know, your thorns

208
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,920
turn table perhaps. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, you know, you listen to that. Oh, baby. Like the headphones on,

209
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,960
too. Oh, we used to do, oh, we just had to have said an hour every night, music for headphones.

210
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,960
And you'd find that the trippiest records, whether it was Pink Floyd or Jimmy Hendricks,

211
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:26,640
racing that phased back and forth. Back and forth. Wow. Wow. Okay. So it was, so you could totally

212
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,240
do whatever, what was the ratio of talk and music? Was it like WKRP kind of like Dr. Johnny fever?

213
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,880
You could do whatever you want it. I mean, we, we did a lot, we're there a lot, there was a lot of talk as

214
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,320
well. It could be. It was like, hey, brother Dave, it's not feeling too well today. So we're going to play some

215
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,520
tunes in the key of D next hour. And you play an hours worth of music in the key of D all segue

216
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,200
together. And you come out and I have to do, you know, 10 minutes of commercials. And of course,

217
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,360
I would love breaking them up with like little vignettes from the fire sign theater just to mess

218
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,200
with people. You're Steve Gilmore used to produce some of the fire sign theater stuff.

219
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,640
You know, they have a wonderful podcast, uh, site too. Yeah. Yeah. The fire sign. Yeah. After,

220
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,640
they were on the Gilmore gang. And after that, then they started up the whole podcast, uh,

221
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,280
stuff that they're doing. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. So so anyway, so that all went fine except,

222
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,800
you know, I was doing overnight. It's a WHFS and making $60 a week, sleeping all day, eating

223
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,000
Roy Rogers hamburgers, ruining my health. And I said this sucks. So I got accepted at grad school,

224
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,280
at Syracuse Newhouse School of Communications and went there, got my master's degree. And then I

225
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,080
came back and I needed a job. Okay. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so this new

226
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,280
fangled thing, cable TV. So, I go to the Warner Communications Building, learning a suit.

227
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,960
Now, this was, this was what year was this? This is going to be 73. Had you gotten laid

228
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:55,280
about that point? Um, maybe once. Okay. All right. Just checking. And so, um, I ran to a promotion

229
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,160
person who said, what do you don't want to wear in his suit? That's time I saw you. You were like,

230
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,840
a bowl of fur, smoking a big fatty with cactus. And I was like, yeah, well, I got to find a

231
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,880
job. So, we might have one for you. And lo and behold, I found myself Columbus Day 73

232
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,720
employed at $250 a week as the local New York City rep for Atlantic Records. Really? Which was

233
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
really cool because back then Atlantic had the wrong stones. And they have the left one. Yeah, let's

234
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,760
take a little longer. I'm spinners, a wreath of Franklin, et cetera, et cetera. Oh my god, that's awesome.

235
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,520
So, I didn't know what I was doing. So, you had to promote the local radio stations. So,

236
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,480
is my job to suck up to the air talent because then, for example, WNWFM, which was a big

237
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,360
Macdaddy station in New York City, the jocks had told discretion to play or not play whatever

238
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,960
they wanted. So, this was, this is really important to know this history because this is where a lot

239
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,800
of stuff, you know, it's important what we're doing right now with pod save music. Yes, it is.

240
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,240
Um, so was this in the payload days, or pre the scandals, or that was after the pills. No,

241
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,320
man, there was nobody know that people wasn't about, like, getting the stuff. It was like

242
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,160
appealing to a higher authority. Like, this was the cool shit to play. So, it's like, if you wanted

243
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,080
to play that track from, yes, you'd play it. Or if you didn't like, yes, and you preferred midler,

244
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,960
you'd play that. Right. Or I'm just trying to set the timeline history, pay all the scandals that

245
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,480
already happened, I think, right? Yeah, I mean, and that was almost, that was a different kind of music

246
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,080
and a format where rotation and repetition mattered. And FM was like, you want to play the same song.

247
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,560
That was my point. So, we had a revolution really. People were tired of the repetition and all the

248
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,440
crap on AM radio. FM radio came along. It was basically loser like you and me who had perfect

249
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,000
faces for radio sitting up there talking shit, right? You should be so self deprivating about that.

250
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, this is our time. This is the geeks and nerds are winning now. That's the geeks. But you were

251
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,520
on television. So, you did it all hair and makeup on. You come on. You know how that works.

252
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,120
So, it was a great, and it was a fun time, and, you know, people would play things and do things

253
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,560
because they liked it. And it was about the music and the passion. And I excelled in that and got promoted

254
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:09,040
and clawed my way up the corporate ladder until I exceeded my own expectations and found myself on

255
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,800
employed. Well, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, first of all. So, you're promoting

256
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,400
all these bands. You got to take these bands up to the station sometimes if they were in town?

257
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,960
Yeah, okay. So, here, all right, one here. Brian Ferrie, rock scene music. Okay, Brian Ferrie's first

258
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,760
U.S. solo album. I drive, I'm driving around in a 1968 yellow Volkswagen convertible. Yeah.

259
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,520
And we go up to the radio station, W R and W and Breyer Cliff Manor in New York. And this is the

260
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,000
station where Howard Stern started? No. Yes, yes. But he wasn't there at the time. This was before Howard.

261
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,440
All right. And the honor of talent is a guy named Jeff Beck. And Jeff Beck's going to interview Brian Ferrie.

262
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,680
Now you have to understand rock scene music and Brian Ferrie are huge act overseas. And the states

263
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,000
they mean absolutely nothing. I mean, here's this good looking guy with his slick back hair doing

264
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,240
a version of it's my party. No way. Yeah. So, it's like it's strange. Yeah, work this one too.

265
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Love is a drug. Yeah. I'm just going to play a little background. Okay. So, we're driving up the

266
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,280
Henry Hudson where Westchester and I put the top down and it's, all right. So, he gets up there

267
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,080
and the interview sucks. The guy on the air has no idea who rock scene music is. It has no idea

268
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,960
Brian Ferrie's. But we model through it. And then drive Brian back. Well, Brian goes storming

269
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,040
it to omit Irrigan's office and says, you're putting a damn convertible. My hair's blown up. The guy

270
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,640
doesn't even know who I am. Oh, no way. If you were to fold a whole attitude trip. Yes. Because he was a big star.

271
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,200
Not in England in the UK, right? All right. Or the time Mick Jagger delivered the tumbling dice record

272
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,440
to Atlantic. And I scurry over to WNW and give it to Scott Muni, the late great Scott Muni. Who plays

273
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,240
it on the air? And then Mick Jagger swagger's into omits office. How's it sound on the radio?

274
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:03,040
He says, well, I like to hear it on the radio. Get leads on the phone. Leeds,

275
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,400
mix and he wants to hear the song. He just played it 10 minutes ago. I don't care.

276
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
Got it. So, you had to call up Scott Muni. So, I call, I hotline Scott Muni. Listen,

277
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,560
fats, I know you just played this. But Mick Jagger's listening to the radio right now and he

278
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,440
wants you to play it again. And he did, of course, right? Because Scott was that kind of guy.

279
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,360
Now, the payback was, Scott would read live radio, come up spots. At the time, the big retailer

280
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,760
in New York City discount, retailer for records, was E.J. Corfets. So, they'd give him live copy.

281
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,720
And it'd be this week, he's exciting Atlantic albums on sale at E.J. Corfets. Emerson Lake and

282
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,320
Palmer. Batman, the spinners, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Blubber, and Heathrow in

283
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,120
your name. And you say Steve Leeds? Right. And if you didn't call him,

284
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,920
you wouldn't listen and you got into deep doo doo. Oh, my god. What a power trip. Oh, no.

285
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,720
That was bad. But I would, I would be a good boy and I usually catch him.

286
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,600
But yeah, but lots of, this Jockey Scott Shannon would do that too. And, you know, when he knew

287
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,760
people were in town, he'd, he'd mentioned them on the radio. That's right. Yeah, he said,

288
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,200
well, I have everybody who has a good morning there. I think they'd be DJ Adam Curry.

289
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,640
And they'd be the DJ. Yeah. I did kind of like those days. They were kind of cool. Yes.

290
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,440
But then I guess, I mean, it kind of went away. Steve, what was the turning point when it

291
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,400
turned to the consultants? Is that the, is that what did it? The consultants really? The consultants

292
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,920
came in and commercialized and made a business out of the format and would come in with their

293
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,160
catalog on index cards, right, with a second set of index cards that had all the liners,

294
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:48,000
where like more of the music you want to hear or more music from dead guys, you know, 13 dead

295
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,520
guys in hour. And so, but why did the consultants get brought in? That's because there were a lot of

296
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,600
me. They were stations in markets where the owners wanted to try this newfangled format

297
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,160
playing that music that for them, though, young kids was the long hair. But they didn't

298
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,720
have to do it. And they were scared of their license and they needed a comfort zone. So if a guy

299
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,400
came in with a suit and a box of records within index cards, well, he must know because look at his

300
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,560
track record. So we bring him in. And so it, it bred this new breed of people who knew how to read

301
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:29,840
cards. Yeah. G. No time references ever allowed. No date. No weather. It was this vacuum where

302
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,400
you were so never supposed to leave. And if you told people 10 minutes on the uphill side of

303
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,760
eight o'clock, it's like, oh, well, people are going to leave it eight o'clock because they got to go

304
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,040
somewhere. Right. Which is kind of what your front on the radio should be to helping you do. I had this

305
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,400
horrible nightmarish fantasy and it happened to me. I was somewhere in the Carolinas and I woke up and

306
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,160
put the radio on and I didn't know where I was. I didn't have a clock in the room. I forgot my clock.

307
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,840
Right. Right. And the radio is not telling you the day. It's just a generic,

308
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,920
could-top 40-session. Where how am I? I had to open the window and look out and see that there was

309
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,680
sun. But that was what radio was supposed to be doing back then according to the concerns.

310
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,360
And who were these independent consultants? What were their backgrounds? How, how did the

311
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,760
someone must have gotten started with something? Must have been some seminal station that got

312
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,040
it all going. Well, funny enough, the guy who's the head of programming at XM,

313
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,240
guy named Lea Abrams. Yeah. And he really was the guy who, he was the young,

314
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,720
wonderful, wonderful, who had had some success in the Midwest in Chicago and he partnered up with

315
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,240
the guy named Kent Burkhard out of Atlanta and Kent was the sales guy who had much success in the

316
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,320
world of top 40 CHR and he brought this young kid in and they were just rolling because it was

317
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,880
the format was called Superstars. Hey, everybody, Superstars, Superstars. And it, you know,

318
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,880
really for a while was the thing. That was the format. It was almost like a national playlist almost.

319
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,320
Right. Was that, was that time that radio and records became important as the-

320
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,920
later, the play- because that's really- so if we shuttle forward, and this is just fascinating.

321
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,240
So in podcasting, I'm just trying to draw analogies that you can well understand.

322
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,360
The commercialization came with the consultant. So it was really fucking with the content.

323
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,400
But then big business became involved because the music and the record industries could generate

324
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,960
huge amounts of sales. If all these Superstar stations started playing tracks from albums,

325
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,400
there was this massive, you know, effort of sales that would be- we'd come out of the exposure.

326
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,320
And then the concert business would, you know, follow with that because they would begin the

327
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,120
roots of the dreaded radio concerts. And so you could break a band on that format,

328
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,360
bring the band in and so you develop the following. So like, always honky Dorian, everybody's

329
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,600
having a lot of fun making a lot of money. But it was, again, short-term thinking.

330
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,160
Because it all came crashing down, you know, and then it was like, we've developed nothing.

331
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,640
We've built no careers or bands. We've got a bunch of faceless songs. We've mentored no air talent.

332
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,800
And there's no training ground. You know, then you can go to the broadcasting school.

333
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,480
But no one knows how to pick a grade. I've had all these guys who had great sounding voices,

334
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,280
great sounding names, and they could read better than anybody.

335
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,040
But they had the personality of a dish rag.

336
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,400
Well, there was no personality.

337
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,800
Yeah. You know, I- I'm a graduate of the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.

338
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,040
Did you know that?

339
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,680
I have certificate.

340
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,880
Well, you could always go back there and be a faculty member now.

341
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,560
That's always plan B. Oh, no. That's why you moved to the curry cottage to Guildford.

342
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,400
Well, I want to start my new, my Guildford School of Broadcasting School of Broadcasting.

343
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,640
That'll be perfect, wouldn't it? So it has a nice ring to it.

344
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,520
So what do we have to do this time? There are some key differences. One is,

345
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,760
you know, we don't have to try and ram 13 songs into an hour because we have no defined time.

346
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,720
And we have infinite number of frequencies. The spectrum is infinite.

347
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,760
Compared to fragmentation, opportunities, or for immense playgrounds, audio playgrounds for people

348
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:24,640
to develop their craft. And expose new unfamiliar things. There's no stinking playlist. There's no stinking consultant.

349
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,360
All there is is this wide open pallet. And each one of you an artist with a paintbrush, and you can just, you know,

350
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,760
it's not about moving things around. It's like taking something brand new and opening and exposing it.

351
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,600
And it's basically where underground FM free form radio was back in the late 60s, early 70s.

352
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,880
Podcasting offers that amazing opportunity. Freedom. Right on.

353
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,080
Now there's a lot of talk about the commercialization of podcasting. Well, I think we all are

354
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,880
capitalists. At the end of the day, we all have to have a roof over our head and food in our

355
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:10,560
tummies, low fat foods, cholesterol free. No cheese. She's not listening. Okay. This is not brought to you

356
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,560
by the American area association. No, not this time. Not this time. But so, yes. So, you know what?

357
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:24,400
So, we can all stay in that cool ethos of non commercial world and fantasy. But, you know what?

358
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:32,000
We all are maturing. We have families. We have personal needs. We all want to have the new iPod.

359
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,960
We all want to have super fast computers and connections in that cost money. So, you know what?

360
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,360
We have to deal with that. And there are people who want to reach this audience. And you know what?

361
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,320
So, it's not about playing eight minutes of gibberish every hour. There may be somewhere in there

362
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,560
a few minutes of information that you might find useful and helpful in your world. Or you could choose

363
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:05,680
to fast forward, you know, or not listen or go away. I mean, the beauty of the media today is no one's

364
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,080
forcing you to do anything. If you don't like what you hear, do something else. Go change the channel.

365
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,880
Switch the frequency. How up to another playlist. It's all about, you know, choices and freedom.

366
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:24,480
And so, if something isn't your cup of tea, move on. But there's nothing wrong with bring some

367
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,080
Monet into it and monetizing it because you guys need to be monetizing it rather than big

368
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,920
brother coming down and saying, okay, here's what we're going to monetize it. Right. Right on.

369
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,360
Right on. Well, I'm really excited about the the music angle of it, the pod safe music angle.

370
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,040
Because I think we're building our own music industry. In many ways, very analogous to what you just

371
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:55,440
spoke about, only again, you know, the the amount of choice and the amount of freedom that the

372
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,600
artists have, particularly to do their own sales. I mean, that's what I think is really cool.

373
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,960
And their own distribution. However, it's still limited online. You know, it's still just

374
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,360
is a limitation compared to what you can do with the distribution Starbucks. You know, I mean,

375
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,040
Jesus, those guys sell some fucking records. You know, like that puts some of the majors to shame

376
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,480
these days how well they're doing. So there's going to be alternative forms of distribution that

377
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,520
will also tap into. Maybe it will be the next Starbucks. You know, it could be maybe the next time

378
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,400
you go to Starbucks, it's an iPod filling station wireless or something like that. You know,

379
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,560
stuff like that could happen. So I think we just have to kind of grow into it. I think that's

380
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:41,360
what I feel is all these opportunities are here. And we have to figure out what the new ways

381
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,200
are going to be. You know, we still have to be developed. Personally, what I find interesting would be

382
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,400
the critical mass of music exposure of pod safe music. That is stuff that is not

383
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,720
put out by any international music company, but is receiving a lot of airplane exposure through

384
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,400
the world of podcasting and the challenge I raise is I wonder if someone can put together a pod safe

385
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:15,520
airplane chart of the most spun spun terrible work. Well, most played pod safe music. It's

386
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,200
interesting. You say that because that's exactly what part of the pod safe music network is going to

387
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,960
be unbelievable. Did I tell you that? I don't know. No, because I mean, this is, I'm not saying

388
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,280
you well, thank you anyway. That's exactly what we're doing. You know, it's going to be

389
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,680
you come on to the site and there's a place for artists to set up their sales to put up their

390
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:43,040
demo material to make whatever they want available to podcasters and or regular listeners.

391
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,560
You know, some licensing options. You know, basically creative comments. You can say how it can

392
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,440
be used, but the point would be you let it, you let your songs be played on podcasts. And then

393
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,680
there's a place where podcasters to log in. And there's a whole bunch of statistics there, obviously

394
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,600
most downloaded, you know, all kinds of charts. But one of those charts, of course, is going to be

395
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,000
most played. You know, that's going to be really interesting because then we, I mean, then you basically

396
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:13,200
close the loop, right? Totally, totally awesome, dude. No, it's all the way. We never finished. We're

397
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,800
like, wait, we're not, let's play some music for a second. Let's play, uh, what do we play?

398
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm going to play that mashup that I played earlier for you. Oh, this is awesome. Yeah,

399
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,880
this is, uh, this came into the mashup at podshow.com email address for the series show

400
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,920
exclusive on the source. The goes that feeds Ray Parker Jr.

401
00:32:50,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

402
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah,ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

403
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,800
We'll get you one teller, we'll get you

404
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,800
Can you get out of your knees?

405
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,800
So many, I can hold it down to it

406
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:29,800
I won't be, I'll be soon, I won't be falling down, I'll be down

407
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,800
I won't be, I won't be, I won't be

408
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Baby, I love you, we'll stay down, I'll be soon

409
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,800
We'll fight, we'll be soon, we'll stay down, I'll be soon

410
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,800
We'll fight, we'll get you one, I'll be soon

411
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,800
We'll fight, we'll be soon, we'll stay down, I'll be soon

412
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:38,800
We'll stay down, I'll be soon, we'll stay down, I'll be soon

413
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Ray Parker, Jr. versus nine inch nails on the daily source code sent to us by Craig Maloney says he

414
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,800
don't know who the original person is who mixed it. He's just a carrier. Good enough for me. I love that. Awesome.

415
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,800
So, you know Steve, we can have to do another one of these because it is just no way we can ever get to all the

416
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,800
all the cool stuff, all the history. You got a lot of knowledge about just how things work and you

417
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,200
work with some amazing people. Just give me a couple of the names of the people that you work with

418
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,040
that you've either through promotion or just working with them and you're some of your favorites.

419
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:20,800
You really hung out with that you really met. Like Joan Jet, I mean, you really were

420
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:28,000
closely with Joan. She was at my wedding. Oh, there you go. Before I forget. Yes, sir.

421
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,000
Do you know who is the hugest Joan Jet fan and would really want to interview her

422
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:42,240
just like the most fucking enormous, huge fan? No, who rock and roll geek, Michael Butler.

423
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,480
So, we should hook that up. Can you hook them up with a phone or something like that? I think he'll be

424
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,440
required to play the eyeliner CD and exchange for that. Well, as long as she gives him the rights to do it.

425
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,680
Well, I think it's on black hard records. I think I can do that, right? Yeah, I think I believe so.

426
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,560
Yeah, could you hook that up, sir? Yes, you'll give me his contact information. I will call Lenny Kuhuna.

427
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Michael Butler will freak out. But he'll be good. And he said he only want, you know, it'll just be

428
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:18,000
what happens when a geek freaks out. He's the rock and roll geek, man. He's not just a geek. He's

429
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,560
rock and roll geek, man. Okay, thank you. So, Joan, he's what I'm feeling. I'm feeling yeah.

430
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,080
Well, I've been blessed and privileged to work with a lot of people on both sides of the fence,

431
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:37,600
super executives, you know, like Chris Blackwell and Doug Morris. So, you know, those are people who,

432
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:46,640
you know, you feel blessed to work with. And then the artists, you know, George Thurgood,

433
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,680
when I was on my own, the first album on round of records was something important and going out

434
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,920
with the stones and their 78 to or same thing with Emerson Lake and Palmer in their heyday

435
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,040
Robert Plant, like convinced him to do his first interview in the, you know, in the Led Zeppelin's

436
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,520
heyday back in the 75 with New York legend Allison Steele, the night bird, right? And he'd never ever

437
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:22,320
done, you know, an interview like that, you know, or, let's see, you two have been over the

438
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:32,560
years so kind to me, really. I actually work the octane baby. So those guys are including

439
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,960
Bono, they're all really nice. Yeah, I mean Bono pulled a little out of two on the ones. That's

440
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,160
why. Maybe I just, I don't know, maybe I pissed him off and was unaware of it, but

441
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,480
well, they, you know, they were very cognizant of what a record promotion person does. And when

442
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,480
their record was knocked out of number one at the radio airplane chart by Blind Millen for one week.

443
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,200
It pissed me off because capital records pulled a fast one at the time and what is that being?

444
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,840
They actually paid a station to play the song like a million times in the overnight. But that's

445
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:13,680
illegal. No, it's not as long as it's disclosed. Wait a minute. So it's legal to pay a station to have

446
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,800
that station to play a song as long as you disclose that information. If you disclose it on the air,

447
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,040
yeah, and, and you have no personal gain and the station's getting paid. Well, first of

448
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:29,200
personal gain. No, no, no, no, no. The station is selling advertising. The following version of

449
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,640
Blind Millen is brought to you by capital records is perfectly legal, really. Yes. Well, why don't

450
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,480
they just do that then? Well, there's a lot of stations that do do that in overnight. They offer

451
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,800
rather than selling a four minute block of four different commercials to sell a four minute hitting

452
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,720
me. No, I don't know. That goes on all the time. Oh, really? Well, that's stuff won't happen in

453
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,240
podcasts. Can they just do their own? Well, why is it? Well, okay. There you go. Do your own. Do

454
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,600
you want to thank him. But when you hear someone talking passionately about record, that's something

455
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,000
else. But anyway, that's pretty amazing. So, so they saw the record back to number one. Wait,

456
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,480
wait, hold on a second. I'm sorry. I'm not even understands how this works. Sorry. So, you buy the

457
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,680
time that plays the record and then multiple times. Multiple times. So, they got enough additional

458
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,840
airplay. It jumped over, chemically. The number of spins. You too, Dr. Justin. Just so you understand

459
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,880
because the top 40 charts that compiled partially. Well, this was the modern rock chart. Okay.

460
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,720
So, but all charts, I think, are still compiled partially through cumulative number of

461
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,360
impressions, aka spins. How many times it's played in a given time period? Interesting. You

462
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,720
use the word impressions because that's something that shows up in the banner world as well.

463
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,040
That's pretty interesting. So, okay. So, that's basically buying your spot in the chart. Right.

464
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,240
So, I was, but I thought, but now that they do sound scan isn't that the way that the chart's

465
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,840
compiled now, or that's still no sound scan is the sales sales. Right. What we're talking about

466
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:58,720
is either media base or BDS. What the fuck does that mean? There's two competing services that

467
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,920
record companies and radio guys look at. There's BDS, which is broadcast data systems, which is

468
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,480
owned by the fine Dutch company, VNU, Yahoo, who owned Nielsen. They own Nielsen correct. And they

469
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,960
have computers that are hooked up to all major market radio stations and secondary markets

470
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,080
and monitor 24 hours, day seven days with every single frigging song they're playing. And that's

471
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,720
tabulated into million different subsets depending on what information you're looking for. Media base

472
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,600
is owned by premier networks, which is owned by clear channel. Right. And they have a similar

473
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:38,320
service, except there's up until several months ago was human monitored. And there would be a

474
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,760
skimmer tape developed fed down your internet connection. And then somebody's sitting there

475
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,120
and going through the songs. And there are people actually out there in radio and who can

476
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,200
listen to a five second snippet and know what that is. And they type up a playlist. It's called

477
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,040
the hit test. By the way, obviously, you would never be able to be employed by media base

478
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,560
given on your averages on that. Sorry. But he's still a guy. He's still a good guy. So okay. So

479
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,880
those are the two monitoring services that the industry is used to reflect what's going on in

480
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,960
radio land. Interesting. All right. So those guys should be fucking frightened of us because,

481
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,600
you know, that's what DRM, what that actually does is they, you know, within, I know it's within

482
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,760
every Microsoft player, probably within every, or Microsoft base, you know, like all the other MP3

483
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,680
players. But also probably on the iPod is they can track when you play, you know, when you press

484
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,040
play and when you stop, they can track exactly the device can track exactly, you know, what you

485
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:45,120
listen to. And we're not feeding it back. I guess. I mean, who knows what what Apple and my,

486
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:50,080
well, you know about grace note, right? No. Okay. When you put a song in your computer,

487
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,640
that was CD in your computer. Yeah. And it pops up. It tells you what the, what it is. It identifies.

488
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,400
It's already sent that to home base. No. When you start listening to that, it sends it to grace note.

489
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,280
And they actually, if you go to gracenote.com, publish, not publish. It's wrong word. They make

490
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,480
available international charts of the most listen to songs. Sorry, correction. Most listen to CDs

491
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,800
or albums by artists internationally. Really. They don't, they, they do have the availability

492
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,200
and the technology to drill it down to. Here's the most listen to music and gilfirding one. Right.

493
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,080
They could do that. But they have to be incentivized to be able to do that. But that database is already

494
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,080
evolved and they're fabulous. So those are the guys that bought CDDB, I think. They are.

495
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,360
Yeah. They are. You know that I was one week late of buying that. I wanted to buy it and I,

496
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,040
and I, and I called the guy said we just sold it to someone else. Like a ridiculous amount. Like,

497
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,880
you know, 75 grand or something. I knew it was, I knew that was going to be fabulous.

498
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,600
Interesting. So are they using that data? Are they selling that to anyone yet?

499
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,360
They haven't figured out how to monetize it. Oh, man. What have some ideas?

500
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,240
Well, they know they know, but they haven't found people who want to pay for it. And they have no

501
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,120
idea with the economic where it'll be. And I'm derelict in my responsibilities because somebody

502
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,960
there has offered that research information on trial basis to me to share with folks up at one

503
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,760
of my clients. Yeah. We should look at that. We should look at that. Yes. So you just said clients.

504
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,920
Because now interestingly enough, Steve, you're a consultant. I, I'm an consultant. That. Okay.

505
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,680
I'll take that. And we should talk about your MTV years and stuff. But let's do that on the,

506
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,480
on the next time in New York. Oh, because we're like 44 minutes. I still want to get your

507
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,600
cream review. Oh, yes. Yes. Well, the reason, the reason I'm here. Yeah. So that's not a

508
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,480
kill for it. Did you, I mean, did you see if you weasel these tickets? How do you hook up with all this?

509
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,240
Sure. I have a very good friend in London who has been involved in the music industry for

510
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,960
the last 20 some odd years. And when I'd heard that there was a possibility that cream

511
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,800
we're going to reunion constant royal Albert Hall. I called him up and I said, listen, if this

512
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,480
happens, can you cop a pair of tickets for us? And he said, yeah, that's no big deal. Who's this? You

513
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,960
want to tell us who this? No, it's my friend Peter Price. Peter Price, Peter Price, the pick of Pickle

514
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,400
Pipper Puppers. I can pop my piece. I'm very careful. Yeah, it's perfect. Yes, it's perfectly

515
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,000
really. Radio, shack. Everybody. It's a handy mic. Not handy, but handy. Really. I'm Peter. Peter,

516
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,640
I met Peter when he was managing musical youth and passed the dog. He asked the Dutchy by the

517
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,040
left. And so I bet you. That's not hard safe. Can't do that. I bet you haven't no matter what.

518
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,040
By the mighty diamonds. No. No, you got the, the, the, I bet you. I bet you that I have the musical

519
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,800
youth first. And Peter had done promotion at Virgin Records UK. He had done international.

520
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,520
He was the managing director of W. E. A. Ireland. He came back to work.

521
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:56,960
Yep. That was a big hit. Remember the huge hit. All right. So all these pop radio stations

522
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,760
are playing this song and they don't really know what's a Dutchy. What back of the time you

523
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,440
mean? Yeah. Yeah. I think most people understood it's Steve.

524
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,440
I don't think so. No. Okay. So anyway, so Peter, that's how I met Peter.

525
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,480
Over that song. And over the years, he's worked for Stockhaken and Waterman. Now he's doing some

526
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:26,640
international work for Universal. And he's just a friend and a guy who I've worked with over the

527
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,840
years. We've known each other. And you know, in fact, I'm staying with him in this trip in London.

528
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,920
Yeah. All done. We have an intermission. Hello, dear. Hello. Yeah. Good. We're just winding up. Steve's

529
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:45,360
going to do his cream review. Cream, something very filled with rich, fat, dairy product. Very unhealthy.

530
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:50,400
Finally some cream today. Cream. By the way, in England, they have this thing called

531
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,880
clotted cream. Yeah. You might as well just like inject fat into your arteries. It's the most unhealthy

532
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,080
thing. Yeah. It's a heart attack. Get in front of the mic, huh? If you're going to talk it's

533
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,280
sort of a heart attack on A. What is it? It's sort of a heart attack on a bone. Yeah. Right.

534
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,240
Heart attack on a bone. Heart attack on a bone. But it's good. Sounds like a recipe. This is what

535
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,800
we didn't talk about this because Steve, do you know what August 5th is? Is that someone's

536
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,240
anniversary? Yeah. That's right. Because Patricia and I decided to get married in New York.

537
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:27,040
Yeah. And was it kind of like a 988? 88. Yeah. We said, uh, how about Friday, right? Did we?

538
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,720
Was it something like that? How about Friday? Yeah. It's okay. It's good. We had to go to

539
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,120
down the city hall and we needed a witness. Can't I get a witness? Yeah. You remember Steve?

540
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:43,440
Yes, I do recall that moment in city hall where the act was committed. Yeah. That was cool.

541
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,520
It does. How many years ago? It'll be 18. 18 years folks and they haven't fought a day.

542
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:56,880
18 blessed years. No one's drawn blood. Let's put it that way. And by the way, they both look as

543
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,360
happy as youthful and young and fresh as the day you married us, Steve. Actually, the only difference

544
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,280
is Adam's hair is differently clothed. That's true. Maybe there was a couple in front of us,

545
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,720
like some punk rock and they were getting married and they needed a witness and I was there

546
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:20,960
witness. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I don't have that thing you may be growing the back of my hair.

547
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,880
What? Appreciate you kept telling me I needed to have a ponytail? No.

548
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:31,760
Hair on your shoulders? No. What do you? A little braid? No, I had that. But no, you kept telling me,

549
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:38,160
let the hair grow in the back. It should go down in the back longer. Oh, okay. She was my stylist.

550
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,400
That was my stylist. She did Adams hair. Adam went on the roadie. We had to send a hair stylist

551
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,200
with him. No, no one, the MTV never paid for a freaking hair. No, they didn't pay for it. They had

552
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,080
to have one. And let's see, we tried getting him corporate endorsements for hair products.

553
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,120
Just never worked. I wish someone had done that. No one ever approached me about a hair endorsement.

554
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,800
You could have been the first pearl guy. Oh, no. I think they went for the short cut gay guy. Look.

555
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,520
That's true. Pearl. They call you the big hair guy. Yeah. They still call me for so many years.

556
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,920
You don't have any big hair. No. No. No. No. But it's just like the bluffed one and the material girl.

557
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,080
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. That's right. That's right. Madonna, Michael and Nate.

558
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,720
He's a good company. Yeah. A really good company. It was. And that's how he can walk around.

559
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,160
Michael Jackson now didn't do anything. Michael Jackson. I think he didn't do this. I think he's

560
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,920
being fucking. He's being fucked. Did you do this? There was an article on the New York Post. It showed

561
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:42,160
his, he has a hair weave in the front. Yeah. I wonder. And it was like, can you imagine

562
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:48,000
with all the plastic surgery? And now he, like, has hair implants? I don't know. I've never had

563
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,520
a contemplate that. We see just. I thought he was a whole week. But answer the question.

564
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,840
Michael Jackson, did he do it or not? Is he guilty? What is it? Child malestation?

565
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,760
But what does that mean? What is, when you see child malestation, he's slept. It's it's clear.

566
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,840
He slept with no, that's not child malestation. No. No. So you're talking touch.

567
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,880
You did. You graved robbed. Every man. No, no, no. That's not what you got me.

568
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,780
That's great, great, really.

569
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,680
Never's feelings, what I did.

570
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,380
And you can't edit on podcast,

571
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,880
wait, no, I don't even think that's the same trouble

572
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,780
when I got it in the Realize of Nicor Filiac.

573
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,880
Yes, what are you doing?

574
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,880
Yeah, wait, how old is he when you stole his heart?

575
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
But you've met Michael Jackson.

576
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,880
I've met him.

577
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
You've met Michael.

578
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,380
I've never had touched the glove one.

579
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,880
I've never touched him.

580
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,880
Wasn't there a story about him and Tommy Matola and Alimo?

581
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,880
Oh, that's, no, that wasn't Tommy Matola that was,

582
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,880
that's for another episode.

583
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,880
In fact, you'll have to interview Harvey Leeds for that.

584
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
Will he tell the story?

585
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,880
Is he going to chicken shit like you just didn't?

586
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,880
No, no, he don't.

587
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
He'll tell the story.

588
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,880
Yeah, he has the specifics much more graphically than I do.

589
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,880
I would love to hear that.

590
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,880
Yeah.

591
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
Well, he got our Harvey's trip to Neverland,

592
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,880
tune in for that particular episode.

593
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,880
Okay.

594
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,880
What I'm in New York.

595
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
Are you good looking?

596
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,880
Is that, you'll have to ask him.

597
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,880
Just check out, both all the Leeds boys are good looking.

598
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,880
Yeah, all two of them.

599
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,880
Yeah, they are, they are.

600
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,880
She said as we stare at the Star Sisters photo outside the door.

601
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,880
No.

602
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,880
Um, all right, so anyway, so Peter Price.

603
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
Oh, so he got us tickets.

604
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,880
We're almost done, huh?

605
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,880
All right, we'll be down in a bit.

606
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,880
All right.

607
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,880
Okay.

608
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,880
Good bye.

609
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,880
And then could you turn the red light back on again over the studio door?

610
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,880
So people know not to just come in.

611
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,880
No, just come in.

612
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,880
So we got tickets for Royal Albert Hall for the third night of four.

613
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Right on.

614
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,880
And got very good seats.

615
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,880
Not ever been to Royal Albert Hall.

616
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,880
Not knowing what a nice place it is to enjoy music.

617
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,880
Do you know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall?

618
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,880
No one really knows.

619
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,880
But it's surprising to you that.

620
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
I could.

621
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,880
I could.

622
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
So how was it, dude?

623
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
So is Ginger Baker like ancient now?

624
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,880
He's only 65.

625
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,880
But he looks ancient, doesn't he?

626
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,880
Well, he looked ancient back in 60.

627
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
That's like Charlie Watts, like his drummers man.

628
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,880
They always look old when they get going.

629
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,880
They do.

630
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
They do.

631
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,880
But the audience last night was amazing for me.

632
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,880
It was the audience.

633
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,880
Because there was nobody there under 40.

634
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,880
Right.

635
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,880
And the merchandising booths where they're selling, you know, 20 pound t-shirts and eight pound

636
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,880
coffee mugs and $60 jackets if you want to go that way or a $35 loan.

637
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,880
A little bit of the ground pound.

638
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,880
Yeah.

639
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,880
So for us dollar guys.

640
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,880
Yeah.

641
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,880
Yeah.

642
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,880
That's right.

643
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,880
But then.

644
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,880
Okay.

645
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,880
So, you know, the audience was.

646
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,880
So how many t-shirts did you buy?

647
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,880
Well, funny enough they're having, they have a website wwwcream2005.com.

648
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,880
But they're not selling anything there yet because.

649
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,880
And of course, brother Harvey had to have a t-shirt.

650
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
So I got a t-shirt.

651
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,880
A t-shirt.

652
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,880
And only one for you for your bro, not one for yourself.

653
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,880
I'm not.

654
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,880
I have enough t-shirts and that's true.

655
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,880
And I asked you where your CDs are or my t-shirts.

656
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,880
Yeah.

657
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,880
Exactly.

658
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,880
So, okay.

659
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,880
So, we're allowed with a haul.

660
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,880
They don't dim the lights.

661
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,880
They keep the lights on the whole time.

662
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,880
Really?

663
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
Yes.

664
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,880
And the audience was a trip.

665
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,880
Why is that?

666
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,880
That's funky.

667
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,880
It was cool.

668
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,880
It worked.

669
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,880
It worked.

670
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,880
It felt much more intimate that way.

671
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,880
Like chandelier lighting.

672
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Is that kind of the deal?

673
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,880
Or is it just really house lights?

674
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,880
House lights.

675
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,880
So, some of your friends from MTV were there.

676
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,880
I saw Tom Freston.

677
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,880
Yeah.

678
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,880
I mean, now like the co-head mother fucking hauncho of Iacom.

679
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
Yes.

680
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,880
Yes.

681
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,880
Unbelievable.

682
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,880
Van Toffler.

683
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
Who's president of MTV?

684
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,880
Right.

685
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
He used to be the lawyer who sued me.

686
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,880
Ah.

687
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,880
Okay.

688
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
So, the weather here in Guilford today is cloudy.

689
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Very nice.

690
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,880
No.

691
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,880
I had respect for Van.

692
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,880
No problem.

693
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,880
Juan Sikes was there.

694
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,880
I said Gary Gursch.

695
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,880
There.

696
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
I don't know who that is.

697
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
He's a president of Strummer Records.

698
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,880
They put out the Mars Volta album.

699
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,880
I saw what the fuck that is.

700
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,880
I had no idea what the Mars Volta records.

701
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,880
Well, so you were living in America?

702
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,880
No.

703
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,880
Okay.

704
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,880
Living in America.

705
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,880
James Brown written by Dan Hartman and Q.

706
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,880
And what's his name?

707
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,880
Charlie Midnight.

708
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,880
Charlie Midnight.

709
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,880
Charlie Midnight.

710
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,880
Charlie Midnight.

711
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,880
Charlie Midnight.

712
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,880
Wow.

713
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,880
There's a reference.

714
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,880
And so sitting right next to me is this young kid.

715
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,880
And sitting next to him is somebody looks really familiar.

716
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,880
Look over.

717
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,880
It's Steve Windwood.

718
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,880
Now, how bizarre is that.

719
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,880
Steve Windwood watching Eric Clapton.

720
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.

721
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,880
I mean, if you substitute Rick Gretch, you had blind faith.

722
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,880
Unbelievable.

723
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,880
By the way, Steve was actually bought merch.

724
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,880
Frisk.

725
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,880
Yeah.

726
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,880
I was shot.

727
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,880
So his kid must be like 20.

728
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
No, no.

729
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
I was kidding.

730
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,880
I'm very young.

731
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Oh, he has a really young new wife.

732
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
I don't know.

733
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,880
Yeah, whatever.

734
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,880
I don't know.

735
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
So that was.

736
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,880
So that was a lot of.

737
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,880
A lot of fun.

738
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,880
That's cool.

739
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,880
Actually, I introduced him because he had just met my brother last week,

740
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,880
because he's looks like he's going to sign with epic.

741
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,880
Yeah.

742
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,880
Really?

743
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,880
Yes.

744
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,880
Based upon his newfound transit.

745
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,880
Well, I think that records the shit, by the way.

746
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,880
Well, that's a great record.

747
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,880
His last album came out on the same label,

748
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,880
The Jam Band String Cheese.

749
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,880
I forgot the name of the label.

750
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,880
It came out.

751
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
But he decided he wanted to, you know,

752
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,880
to the corporate, you know, universe of records.

753
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,880
Yeah.

754
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,880
Fuck, man.

755
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,880
So, you know, it was cool watching Steve Windwood, you know, there.

756
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,880
And so, the, you know, I was lucky.

757
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
Here's the Murray, the K connection again.

758
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,880
When I was a, we,

759
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,880
uh, led back in 1967.

760
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,880
Cream played their first show ever in New York City.

761
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,880
Excuse me.

762
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,880
First shows.

763
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,880
For nine days straight,

764
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,880
they played five shows a day at the RKO theater.

765
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,880
For the Murray, the K Easter review.

766
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,880
No way.

767
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,880
And who else was on the bill?

768
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,880
Because they were probably were forced onto the bill

769
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,880
by one of the agents saying,

770
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,880
well, if you want such and such,

771
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,880
you have to take this new band.

772
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,880
Five shows a day.

773
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,880
Five shows.

774
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,880
And if you got there before,

775
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,880
and you got a free album.

776
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,880
So, the who were on the show,

777
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,880
the cream,

778
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,880
and the headliner was Wilson Pickett and Mitch Ryder.

779
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,880
No way.

780
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,880
So, this is amazing.

781
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,880
This is amazing.

782
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,880
It was probably four or five bucks or something.

783
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,880
It was amazing.

784
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,880
And when people saw a cream,

785
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,880
they were like,

786
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,880
it was arrested the band.

787
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,880
Because there were only three guys.

788
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,880
Right.

789
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,880
And I remember the marquee outside.

790
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,880
So vividly,

791
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,880
it's three little mountains of cream.

792
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,880
I said,

793
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,880
debut cream.

794
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,880
I was like,

795
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,880
what the heck is that?

796
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Yeah.

797
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,880
And they did two songs.

798
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
They did,

799
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,880
um,

800
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,880
I feel free.

801
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,880
And I'm so glad.

802
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,880
Which, by the way,

803
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,880
is the song they opened up with last night.

804
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,880
I'm so glad.

805
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,880
Interesting opener.

806
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,880
Yes.

807
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,880
Yeah.

808
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,880
So the show was really,

809
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,880
um,

810
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,880
interesting.

811
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,880
Because the rumors around are that they,

812
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,880
the only reason this is going on,

813
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,880
is Eric Clapton wants to help out Jack and Ginger

814
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,880
and put some money in their pocket.

815
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,880
Is that, well,

816
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,880
you know what?

817
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,880
That would probably make a lot of sense.

818
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,880
I even see Ringo Star doing,

819
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,880
infomercials for time,

820
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
life records.

821
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,880
So I guess the,

822
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,880
the might of the last forever.

823
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,880
You know,

824
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,880
rumor has it that Ginger is not in the best of health.

825
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,880
Yeah.

826
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,880
Well, I think he's been sick for a while, hasn't he?

827
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,880
I don't know.

828
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,880
I remember these rumors from 20 years ago, even.

829
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,880
So Eric certainly doesn't need the money,

830
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,880
nor the exposure at this point in his career.

831
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,880
So he agreed to do these four shows with a DVD committed

832
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,880
to coming out this fall.

833
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,880
That's really sweet.

834
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,880
Yes.

835
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,880
That's really sweet of him.

836
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,880
And there's talk that if the music is approved,

837
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,880
that they will allow a CD to be made from it as well.

838
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Does that mean there might be a tour to fall along?

839
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,880
No.

840
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,880
Because Ron Delzner,

841
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,880
the people's promoter in New York City.

842
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,880
Is that, do I, do I know the hint of sarcasm there,

843
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,880
Mr. Leads?

844
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,880
Not at all.

845
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Uh, has offered them a boatload of money to play

846
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,880
Madison Square Garden, and they've turned it down.

847
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,880
And then I heard that,

848
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,880
well, then it can't be about money.

849
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
Why did turn it down?

850
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,880
Well, then I heard that it's driving the price up.

851
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
No, no, no.

852
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,880
A, Eric has some tour plans,

853
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,880
and B, equally, or more important,

854
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,880
probably in the reality world,

855
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,880
is that Ginger has some issues

856
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,880
and can't come back into the states.

857
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
Oh, man.

858
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,880
No, that's a rumor.

859
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,880
I want to clarify.

860
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,880
That's probably a taxation rumor.

861
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,880
No, no, no.

862
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
I don't think it's something like that.

863
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
Really?

864
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,880
Is it drugged there?

865
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,880
I don't know.

866
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,880
Come on.

867
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,880
Not from 100,000 years ago.

868
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,880
The US government has a long memory.

869
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,880
By the way, folks,

870
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,880
in the Curry Broadcast studios here in Gilford,

871
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,880
there's a photo of Adam and W on the wall.

872
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,880
It's a good one, isn't it?

873
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,880
Yes.

874
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,880
Yes.

875
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,880
I know what he's doing all those years in Holland.

876
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,880
Oh, I just want, not equal, equal opportunity.

877
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,880
If you haven't listened to it,

878
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,880
check out that John Kerry podcast.

879
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,880
Oh, yeah, that was cool.

880
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,880
Well, can I just, I just want to, I just want to play one,

881
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,880
one snippet.

882
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,880
Just listen to this part, Steve.

883
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
I didn't play this for you.

884
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,880
Listen to this.

885
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,880
By the way, we are podcasting today on top of

886
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,880
Jack's blanket.

887
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,880
Listen to me.

888
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,880
And we're having to be really careful because

889
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,880
Elizabeth has her dot coat sitting on this.

890
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,880
This is great stuff.

891
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,880
I like it.

892
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,880
I have my dad.

893
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,880
Listen to what she said.

894
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,880
Zero sitting on Jack's blanket, which, by the way,

895
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,880
is really important because she has a great,

896
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,880
I'm not drinking that coat anymore.

897
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,880
And it is like a huge change for me.

898
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,880
First, how long has it been there?

899
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,880
Cold turkey for like three months?

900
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,880
Yeah.

901
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,880
Three months?

902
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
You're still drinking it there.

903
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,880
I am.

904
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,880
But I'm finding out that I'm not drinking quite a lot.

905
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,880
It's not quite as much as I thought it was.

906
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,880
That you were drinking mussels.

907
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,880
That you were drinking mussels.

908
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,880
It's like John and Drew.

909
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,880
It's one of those things to death.

910
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,880
I don't even waste the blood on the blanket.

911
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,880
I don't think it's the worst thing that I've ever gotten on this blanket.

912
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,880
That's it.

913
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,880
Didn't need to know that.

914
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,880
Was that the line of the, of the whole podcast?

915
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,880
No, is that product placement for Diet Coke?

916
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,880
No, for sprite zero, whatever it is.

917
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:01,880
No, but that's, you know, this is, if I, if I listen to this guy talking,

918
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,880
instead of that long-head jackass, you know,

919
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
I would have had different feelings about,

920
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
about the outcome of, of the election.

921
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,880
This is really good.

922
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,880
And she's talking about her life and the radiation that she's going through.

923
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,880
It's interesting shit.

924
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,880
Well, podcasting will change the politics of the world soon.

925
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,880
Did better.

926
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Okay, I'm sorry.

927
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,880
Back to the, back to the, back to the cream reunion.

928
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,880
Okay.

929
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,880
So they opened up with, I'm so glad.

930
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,880
I didn't need it.

931
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,880
It's spoonful.

932
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,880
Then clapped and sang outside woman blues.

933
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,880
Then changed her.

934
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,880
Did pressed rat and wart ag.

935
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
It was remind me of like an eanduri thing.

936
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,880
It's almost like a rap thing.

937
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,880
It was pretty wild.

938
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,880
Did you do a drum solo?

939
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,880
Did you?

940
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,880
Well, we'll get to that.

941
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,880
Okay.

942
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,880
Then we did sleepy time.

943
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,880
NSU.

944
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,880
Erica did badge.

945
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,880
You know, singing on that.

946
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,880
And of course now, today is the morning after the British election.

947
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,880
Right.

948
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,880
And Tony Blair won.

949
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,880
He won.

950
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,880
But he got his ass woke, because everybody expressed their

951
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,880
displeasure with him being W Junior.

952
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,880
Well, and, and in this parliament, you know, and I figured out how it works.

953
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,880
Now, it's, it's, it's number of seats in the house.

954
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,880
So, um, labor still has a majority, but only by 66 votes.

955
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,880
Or that's projected, I think, at this time.

956
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,880
But it's almost over.

957
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,880
So that's pretty much what's going to be.

958
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,880
So, how ironic the day of the British election.

959
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
Cream do politician.

960
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
Yeah, of course.

961
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Of course.

962
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,880
Sweet wine, Roland and Tumblin.

963
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,880
Uh, we're, we're Jack didn't play base.

964
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,880
He just, like, jammed on the harmonic of the whole time.

965
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,880
Uh, now they did one non cream song, Stormy Monday, which is, like, a

966
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
Clapton, you know, Evergreen.

967
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,880
So that was interesting.

968
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,880
They did deserted cities.

969
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,880
One under bed sign.

970
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
We're going wrong.

971
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Eric did it.

972
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
You know, jammed up version of Crossroads.

973
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,880
And this little girl, one of the youngsters in the audience, go.

974
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,880
Screams.

975
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,880
You're my hero.

976
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,880
Don't you crossroads?

977
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,880
Yeah.

978
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
So that was cool.

979
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,880
It's in on top.

980
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,880
White room.

981
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880
And then the piece that exists.

982
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,880
They opened up.

983
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
And then Jack and ginger.

984
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,880
Sorry.

985
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,880
Jack and Eric walk off stage and let ginger just go wild for about 10 minutes.

986
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,880
Oh, really?

987
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,880
Hold.

988
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,880
Now, here's, here's the culpa.

989
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,880
As soon as he breaks in drum solo, people start rushing the stage.

990
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,880
Really?

991
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,880
See, he's, like, 40 year old.

992
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,880
Oh, push it up to this stage with his no security guard.

993
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,880
No.

994
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,880
And adult concert elite event.

995
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,880
Right.

996
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,880
So it was, it was pretty funny.

997
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,880
Oh, and why were people dressed?

998
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
Oh, you know, lots of denim.

999
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,880
But there were, you know, it was a very subdued crowd.

1000
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,880
There wasn't a lot of body piercings.

1001
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:34,880
Let's put it that.

1002
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,880
How about dope smoking?

1003
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,880
Must have been some pleased.

1004
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,880
Didn't see any of it.

1005
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,880
Didn't see it.

1006
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,880
I think that went on before.

1007
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,880
I think people arrived with that.

1008
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,880
And, oh, so the, sort of the, the,

1009
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
with the stage is covered by this white psych.

1010
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,880
And projected on it is a light show.

1011
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,880
I love the old film more.

1012
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,880
But it's not with the liquids and stuff.

1013
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,880
Yeah.

1014
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,880
It's just, right.

1015
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,880
It's like an orange.

1016
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
It's an animated, an animated.

1017
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,880
I was like, okay.

1018
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,880
And he's going off on to it.

1019
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,880
I mean, it's just like, it's out.

1020
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,880
Was it was the animated stuff, okay?

1021
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,880
Or was it kind of lame?

1022
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,880
It worked.

1023
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,880
But if you saw, if you lived to that, it was lame.

1024
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,880
The house lights on too.

1025
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,880
That was an infunky.

1026
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,880
It was weird.

1027
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,880
But you won't be able to see it in DVD coming out this fall on.

1028
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,880
One over home video.

1029
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,880
I don't know.

1030
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,880
Yeah.

1031
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,880
It definitely will.

1032
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,880
And so that was it.

1033
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,880
And told and they come back and finish the few notes.

1034
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,880
And I'm sorry.

1035
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,880
I'm boring.

1036
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,880
Go.

1037
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,880
It's just, it's a long, it's a long podcast.

1038
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,880
Like a box of gin.

1039
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,880
No, no, no.

1040
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,880
Take no note of that.

1041
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,880
This is fascinating, Steve.

1042
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,880
I wish we could play some of these songs, which we can't.

1043
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,880
Yeah.

1044
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,880
That's the bummer here.

1045
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,880
Yeah.

1046
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,880
It's not pot safe.

1047
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,880
Yeah.

1048
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,880
Fucking bummer.

1049
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,880
So, towed finishes.

1050
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,880
Grand finale.

1051
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,880
Boom.

1052
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Everybody's screaming.

1053
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:45,880
They walk off stage.

1054
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,880
And the three of them joined together for the first time

1055
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,880
or leading in bow.

1056
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,880
Because to me, they started off like a house on fire.

1057
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
It was almost like going through the mechanical motions.

1058
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,880
Eric just didn't seem.

1059
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,880
He was like Mr. Cash will out there with his sneakers.

1060
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,880
And his, you know, turquoise blue shirt.

1061
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,880
And he was just like, he was like doing it.

1062
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,880
Because he was just doing it.

1063
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,880
Right.

1064
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,880
And so it kind of was at the end.

1065
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,880
I felt it was lackluster.

1066
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,880
And they came back.

1067
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,880
And they're not going right.

1068
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Well, white room.

1069
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,880
I've heard Clapton do as a solo performance.

1070
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,880
But you said they already played that.

1071
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,880
Right.

1072
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,880
But it was, it was great live.

1073
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,880
But last night it was just like so mechanical.

1074
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,880
You know.

1075
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,880
You know.

1076
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:22,880
You know.

1077
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,880
You know.

1078
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,880
You know.

1079
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,880
Anyway, so toad.

1080
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
That's the end.

1081
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
People rush off.

1082
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,880
And then they come back for an encore.

1083
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
And what do you think their encore would be?

1084
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
White room again.

1085
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,880
Sunshine of your love.

1086
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,880
Ah, that's pretty cool.

1087
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,880
And of course, that, you know.

1088
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,880
Again, I was like hoping for the heavens to open.

1089
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,880
It didn't happen.

1090
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,880
But you know what?

1091
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
These guys were in their 60s.

1092
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
It was a fantasy.

1093
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,880
It was fun.

1094
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,880
They did.

1095
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,880
Sorry about that.

1096
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
We're just going to go a little background ambience.

1097
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,880
And this was the finale last night.

1098
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,880
And it will be the finale tonight as the fourth consecutive night of Cremes reunion.

1099
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,880
Royal Albert Hall.

1100
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,880
You're talking it up Steve.

1101
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,880
You're talking up the record.

1102
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,880
Hey, we got 10 on the uphill side of wherever you are.

1103
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,880
Whatever time you're listening.

1104
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,880
This is ever coming.

1105
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:07,880
Did you break a jack bruise?

1106
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,880
On the ancorate.

1107
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,880
See, I need the digital clocks.

1108
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,880
I can tell.

1109
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,880
Yeah.

1110
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,880
Hard for sure.

1111
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,880
That liner reader card for sure.

1112
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,880
No, that would be somebody else.

1113
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Oh, and Sean Penn was in the audience last night too.

1114
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,880
So it was, he's right.

1115
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,880
He was a festive evening from start to finish.

1116
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,880
You know, I Sean Penn story.

1117
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,880
I told you my Sean Penn story, didn't I?

1118
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,880
No, but you must know Michael Penn.

1119
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,880
No, him too.

1120
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,880
But it was Sean Penn.

1121
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,880
Where is that?

1122
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,880
It was, that was his musical brother.

1123
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,880
But Chris Penn.

1124
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,880
Chris.

1125
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,880
That was the, the tubby one.

1126
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,880
Come on man.

1127
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,880
Don't you remember he got in all kinds of fights and shit.

1128
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,880
He was like the Billy Carter of the Penn Brothers.

1129
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,880
Wow.

1130
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,880
I didn't know the Penn Brothers.

1131
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,880
And he did a little bit of acting.

1132
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,880
Yeah.

1133
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,880
It was obnoxious.

1134
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,880
So I remember the MGM grand.

1135
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:00,880
Yes.

1136
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,880
MGM grand was the airline between Los Angeles and JFK.

1137
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,880
And it was all first class, like 737 with state rooms.

1138
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,880
The preferred airliner of the Jays.

1139
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,880
Yeah.

1140
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,880
Of course.

1141
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,880
Well, it was still around and it was golden toilets.

1142
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,880
And it was just fucking great.

1143
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,880
And it was all movie stars and record execs and celebrities.

1144
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,880
And it was like our private little airline.

1145
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,880
And how many seats were?

1146
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,880
How many people?

1147
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,880
The whole plane was maybe like 50 or something like that.

1148
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
And that was it.

1149
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,880
And so I was flying out by myself.

1150
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,880
And I had a state room.

1151
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,880
So it was, you know, just like in a train.

1152
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,880
We closed and there's three on each side.

1153
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,880
And the table can levitate up in the middle.

1154
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
So you can have your meals facing each other.

1155
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,880
And I was there with Sean Penn.

1156
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,880
Chris Penn.

1157
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
And his mom.

1158
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,880
And we're sitting there the four of us in the state room for like five and a half hours.

1159
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,880
And you know, it was really uncomfortable because, you know, it's like dude.

1160
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,880
You know, this is like Sean Penn.

1161
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,880
And at the time he just, you know, the big messy divorce from Madonna and everything.

1162
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,880
So first Chris Penn is there.

1163
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,880
You know, taking off his shirt, he's walking around with, you know, with a bear.

1164
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,880
He's a bear chest drinking beer.

1165
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,880
You know, burping and farting all over the place about the whole plane.

1166
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,880
So he's just an embarrassment by himself.

1167
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,880
And then, you know, finally, so Sean Penn says,

1168
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,880
Yeah, how you doing?

1169
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,880
Are you the guy from VH1, right?

1170
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,880
So of course immediately, I'm shattered.

1171
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,880
It's just fucking shattered.

1172
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,880
And say, uh, wrong channel.

1173
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,880
So I said, hey, dude.

1174
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,880
Uh, what was it like?

1175
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,880
I don't know.

1176
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,880
He says,

1177
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,880
Hell have no fury, my friend.

1178
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,880
That's what his response was.

1179
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,880
Hell have no fury.

1180
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,880
And we didn't talk about anything.

1181
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
And he's got issues, right?

1182
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,880
I think I like him.

1183
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,880
He's a fucking bitch.

1184
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,880
What do you say at the Academy of Worts?

1185
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,880
He was trashing that I didn't see the Academy of Worts.

1186
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,880
I like Sean Penn.

1187
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,880
He's a great actor.

1188
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
Who was the male actor in Alphi?

1189
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,880
I don't know.

1190
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:44,880
I haven't seen Alphi.

1191
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,880
Oh, he keeps, he can't make nasty references.

1192
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
So.

1193
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,880
No.

1194
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,880
Don't know.

1195
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,880
Well, he always has some issues.

1196
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,880
Oh, whatever.

1197
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,880
Yes.

1198
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,880
Whatever.

1199
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,880
Hey, Steve, was any more you want to say about the cream stuff?

1200
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,880
Um, no.

1201
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,880
Did it, did it fulfill your fantasy?

1202
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,880
Listen, I went to the first show in America.

1203
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,880
I have some, you know, in your life,

1204
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,880
you don't get too many chances to have closure.

1205
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,880
Yeah, because you went to the first one and kind of the last one.

1206
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,880
That's closure.

1207
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,880
So in the final days of my life, I can look up and go, okay.

1208
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,880
I spent enough time doing the things I needed to do.

1209
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,880
And one of those was, I got to see cream.

1210
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,880
The entire career from beginning to end.

1211
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:24,880
That's true.

1212
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,880
Oh, my God.

1213
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,880
That's so beautiful.

1214
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,880
Oh, that's a rock and roll lifestyle.

1215
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,880
And I'm not a rock and roll geek.

1216
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,880
And now what you hate, man?

1217
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,880
Hook that up for my boy.

1218
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,880
No, hold on.

1219
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,880
Right on time.

1220
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,880
Right on time.

1221
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,880
This is almost ready, isn't it?

1222
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,880
Whatever.

1223
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,880
Oh, you know what?

1224
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,880
That's Jeremy.

1225
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,880
Hello.

1226
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,880
Okay.

1227
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,880
Well, Adam is having this conversation.

1228
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,880
And boring you to hear listening to that conversation.

1229
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
Even I just doing a podcast.

1230
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,880
So we're going to close out this special edition.

1231
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,880
What give you a call?

1232
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,880
From the curry cottage.

1233
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,880
Okay.

1234
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,880
In Guilford, England.

1235
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,880
The Saturn Curry was Jeremy.

1236
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,880
He was finishing his cell phone call, which he has now terminated.

1237
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,880
Yeah.

1238
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,880
All right.

1239
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,880
You know what?

1240
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,880
I need one more bit from you.

1241
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Because what we didn't talk about is that you.

1242
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,880
The Adam.

1243
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,880
You.

1244
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,880
Yes.

1245
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,880
This is the Adam.

1246
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,880
I hope people listen to this because that was a lesson.

1247
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,880
You had some great stories, man.

1248
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,880
I love listening to that.

1249
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,880
This would be good for people over the weekend.

1250
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,880
They can carry it through like an hour and nine minutes already.

1251
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,880
So let's.

1252
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
It's a lot of treadmill time to be listening.

1253
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,880
Yeah, no shit.

1254
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,880
Well, maybe they already checked out who knows.

1255
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,880
You hooked up the serious deal.

1256
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,880
Yeah.

1257
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,880
You're to blame.

1258
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,880
I'm to blame.

1259
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,880
Okay.

1260
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Go ahead and tell us what's the ability.

1261
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,880
Tell us what happened, man.

1262
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,880
Well, it's not.

1263
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:40,880
It's not.

1264
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,880
You know, it's not very exciting.

1265
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,880
It's not as enticing as.

1266
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,880
No, I know.

1267
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,880
MTV story.

1268
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,880
That's what.

1269
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,880
Well, man.

1270
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,880
It's almost as right.

1271
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,880
But to me to bring closure Steve, we started with the MTV story.

1272
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,880
But there's no closure.

1273
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,880
This is a continuing epoch.

1274
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,880
That's right.

1275
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:54,880
So Adam is.

1276
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,880
You know, on the front page of the New York friggin times.

1277
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,880
This was a couple weeks ago.

1278
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,880
And he's everywhere.

1279
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,880
And I hear his podcast.

1280
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,880
He's going to be in New York.

1281
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,880
See the power of podcasts.

1282
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,880
Yeah.

1283
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,880
You know what?

1284
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,880
I got to look him up.

1285
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,880
I haven't seen his post since the days at MTV.

1286
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,880
I kind of missed his whole dot com.

1287
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,880
That chapter of the book sort of fell out of my.

1288
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,880
Per view because I was immersed in my own.

1289
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,880
Misha Goss.

1290
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,880
So, um, I said, you know, I got to find him tracking down and I tracked him down.

1291
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,880
And I said, you, uh, being in New York.

1292
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,880
Yeah.

1293
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,880
Hey, why don't you come up to serious.

1294
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,880
Since you're a toy geek and a technology geek, you might like this.

1295
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,880
And of course, I at the time mentioned it to Scott Greenstein, who's president of serious

1296
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
music sports and entertainment.

1297
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
And he said, oh, we got to get him here.

1298
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,880
We got to get him here.

1299
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,880
I said, no, no, he'll be here.

1300
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,880
Oh, we got to get this podcasting thing going here.

1301
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,880
And I said, you know, that's exactly what everyone envisioned.

1302
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,880
So, we love their go.

1303
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,880
I'm going to get him here.

1304
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,880
I said, oh, well, you know, I'll feel be here.

1305
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,880
You can talk to him.

1306
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
Oh, great.

1307
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,880
So, um, that's not fair.

1308
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,880
He doesn't talk like that.

1309
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
But anyways, he does talk like a radio guy kind of.

1310
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,880
He's absolutely no radio.

1311
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,880
He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a film

1312
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
and an attorney.

1313
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
He's a lawyer.

1314
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,880
Oh yeah, low but low is there.

1315
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,880
Yes, but he, if you ask him a legal question, I don't know.

1316
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,880
I don't know.

1317
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:32,600
Yeah, that's done great so invited Adam up and showed him all the toys because it's a pretty

1318
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:40,200
interesting place when 50 fucking full-blown studios is like the entire podcast universe could fit in there

1319
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:45,000
and happily live for the next 10 years cranking out great shit. Mind you it's in Midtown Manhattan

1320
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:52,200
in a sexy location all the studios are all glass because the guy who designed this this Canadian

1321
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:57,480
guy David Margolis had this vision and that's how he did it and back then in those days apparently

1322
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,240
there was the resources to do it. Oh yeah that was dot com money to build that shit right and

1323
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,440
I wasn't there I assumed so but you know in this in this day in age it would be you know

1324
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,160
somewhere else and not a high rent district and it wouldn't be a sexy looking. Yeah

1325
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,560
But all the toys and bells and whistles and tools and digital studios and work stations

1326
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,160
and this people buzzing all over the place there's a positive

1327
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,600
I emphasize that because in the entertainment business and a lot of not a lot of positive

1328
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:28,360
there's a lot of positive young energy running around much probably like MTV was prior to Adam and I

1329
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,880
you know art tour of duty through there but there's also a lot of old radio guys run I mean not old but you know

1330
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:40,360
guys are doing radio shows who harking back and and are looking for the holy grail and want to be able

1331
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,920
play things and talk about things and not be confined by because liner cuts that's right because it's

1332
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,760
totally open format right or not or is it totally or did not totally open or does it depend on the channel

1333
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:58,680
you know there there it is a commercial money making entity so there is that need the money making

1334
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:08,440
part maybe not yet perhaps so you know there need to be successful in in that way and so

1335
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:14,840
there is a desire need to find out what what response and feedback is the good part is there's no

1336
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:20,440
parent company there's no you know big brother you know looking down upon you and say

1337
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:26,760
via com on MTV you mean or any any big it's you know it's a publicly traded stock it's

1338
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:32,440
yeah it's yeah it's you know you make your own bed you lay in it right so they're on their strategy

1339
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:38,680
and they're moving it along so it was it was a moment where Scott had wanted to meet Adam and Adam came

1340
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:45,960
up and I brought him into the office and the two of them started talking and you know Scott made

1341
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:54,280
a podcasting overture that I guess Adam felt had some value to it and he and the gentleman you've

1342
01:13:54,280 --> 01:14:03,000
heard on on this show before or this podcast rather Ron struck a deal and I said well you know

1343
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,280
I fucked up your life twice now yep so what are we going to do Steve on this show so there's

1345
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:20,520

1346
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:28,760

1347
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:37,400
interesting left of center different unique tasty flavorful that's basically anything that is

1348
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:43,240
an on regular radio they need to let Adam at the source code know about that and that's but there's

1349
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,400
a special email drop where you could yeah well there's a couple and that that's for the daily

1350
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,520
source code as well it's like that you know like the mashup today I got off with the so that's

1353
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:13,960
might recall in school my weekly reader or even go back to readers digest not everybody has or

1354
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:20,840
readers digest condensed books not everybody has the discretionary time to go to the source and

1355
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:27,000
feel and and participate but they hear about it we want to be part of it and how do you do that

1356
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,040
in this day of electronic choices where you're over mediated from all sides so there's this

1357
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:37,560
going to be a daily for our program that satellite subscribers we have listened to where

1358
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:43,720
Adam will act as the editor the filter of of turning you want to interesting things

1359
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,440
that rather than you if you don't have the discretionary downtime which some people don't believe

1360
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,840
or not of surfing and finding things out he'll be able to turn you on and be like the

1361
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:59,000
canary in the coal mine the early adapter detector I like that I'll be the canary in the coal mine

1362
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,720

1363
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:10,760
