Delta Shara Charley 2-0-7

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi, this is Rachel from AudioCollective.net.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You're listening to Adam Curry on the Daily Stories Code.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Transmaders?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We don't need noss.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Think in transmere?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Fantastic.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is Adam Curry.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And it's your Daily Source Code for Wednesday, July 13, 2005.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Alrighty everybody, how you doing?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's first of all apologies for yesterday.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No source code and I'll get into all the gory details as to why that happened.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Man, I've been through the ringer as it comes to...

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, the ringer, the cell phone,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
explanations about that and more in today's Daily Source Code.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Had a long chat with Casplaster Mike today.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He's rightly, I guess, been pitching at me

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that I haven't been using Casplaster when I'm at home.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And I explain to him why is because I want to be able to hook up my stereo valve process

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
or on my external gear.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And that's when the big light bulbs start to go off

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
as Mike explained exactly how to wire in through Casplaster.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, shoot, it's working.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And it sounds great as far as I can tell.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We'll really find out, of course, after the show's over.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mike suggests that I might not want to do an extended long version.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Unless it'd be no good.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, so I don't have to go into too much details to how it's actually done.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But the only issue now is I have to figure out a better way to sit

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
because I've got the microphone and the windscreen is just blocking out the view of the crap

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
actually, maybe I can.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wait, why don't I turn it tablet mode?

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, Eureka.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now we're talking, okay.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is a bit of a big thing.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, so now it's all in tablet mode.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So this is going to be kind of a partial beta test,

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
partial talk about shit, partial play some stuff show.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We've got podcasts, music on the way.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Something different and a mashup from mashuptown.com.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jicky Boys.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Switching the live.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000

Okay.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You know one of the most important things

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I guess it's kind of obvious but

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
when you're doing a podcast you've got to be sitting right you know.

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I haven't quite found the right pose right now.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now, I'm in a big office swivel chair with a rather high armrest and a mash-up tub for you.com.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A dove, where to go, man.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thank you.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He's been supplying me with the mash-ups mash-up town.com.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And of course, as always, everything that we talk about here on the source code you can find in the

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
show notes at dailysourcecode.com or on www.curry.com.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, I've had the crapplet on my lap now.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Recline just a little bit in this office chair.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And so, I've got the mic kind of, you know, swivel downwards toward me.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And that's also because I have this fucking weird hum here if I turn the mic towards the ceiling.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know if you can hear that.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's really faint now, which is a good thing, of course, because we don't really want any hum.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So, everything should be working.

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm liking the way it sounds.

154
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is the cast-blaster.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can find that at cast-blaster.com.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you want to more about it, there's a version you can use.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I think a perpetuity, a little record ten minutes, and then you can purchase it.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's still in beta, but already I'm seeing just by using it again.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And it's only been, what?

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Like, a week and a half or two weeks since I used cast-blaster for the last time.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Already, I'm seeing more things.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think we should, we should have the could possibly go into, into the one-point

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
no version.

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can see mic just groaning.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like, no groaning, as we speak.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No more features.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Anyway, it's still hot when the middle of our heat wave here in the UK.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
About 33 degrees centigrade, which is hot.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's in the, what is that?

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's got to be in the 90s, far in the 90s.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hold on, maybe.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't I have an OSX widget for that?

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hold on.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let me see.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think I do.

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Here we go.

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Comvert.

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Does that have temperatures?

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Uh, temperature.

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
There we go.

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We want to convert it from Celsius.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So it's 33.

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, 91.4.

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hey, 91.4 degrees outside, everybody.

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Um, so you can hear the fan in the background.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Very lightly.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's actually outside the door.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Patricia put the bedroom fan there.

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So again, this house definitely not equipped for this type of weather.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But we aren't enjoying it, not complaining whatsoever.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Um, this shit I was complaining about was what started Sunday.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
All of a sudden, um, when I use my phone, my cell phone.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And I have a virgin mobile over here.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I really liked that because I wanted to pre-pay it in necessarily.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In fact, when we moved here, didn't even have a UK bank account or credit card.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So that would have been hard anyway.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But I didn't want to email, basically.

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And I also wanted to kind of know what we were spending on, on phone costs.

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Um, so, and I'm pretty happy with virgin mobile.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Um, it's, uh, it's way too expensive when you're roaming overseas.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Um, so I have, uh, a team mobile, again, a pre-pay team mobile for the US.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But anyway, um, whether, if I tried to call out on Sunday,

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I would get the three tones in succession that goes, do, do, do, do.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Um, and it wouldn't do anything with just this connect.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And if I tried to call myself on, it would, uh, a message will come on saying this cell phone

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is currently not accepting connections.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Now, this was a new one.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I've, I didn't know what disconnect notices are.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And you know, there was plenty of money in the account and all that was set.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Um, what happened is my phone got blacklisted.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now, I've posted about this a couple times.

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And, um, I think I mentioned it in the previous source code.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What that means, essentially, is there's a centralized database that the networks all used together.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Um, and we'll have access to.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And if your phone is lost or stolen, you report that to your, uh, network carrier.

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then they put it on the blacklist.

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So it gets, uh, a checkmark and it's put into this database.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And so then you get the result.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Um, if you try to use it on the virgin network with a version SIM card, it won't work.

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But it's a centralized database.

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So it'll also, um, uh, happen, uh, or it'll also will stop to function on any of the other UK networks.

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It may work in other, in other parts of the world.

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But that's pretty much what they want to do.

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Um, is, and I, and I think since team mobiles on it, they're probably covering the states as well.

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So, uh, effectively, um, it's trying to deter, um, cell phone theft.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Duh.

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Uh, so that's great.

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But somehow I got on this list and I hadn't reported it.

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And, uh, that identified that I was the owner of the account.

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And, you know, the problem, because of course I call them up.

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And, you know, a member of the team will be right with you.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It takes 30 minutes every single time you call and want to get a live person on the phone.

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Um, at Virgin.

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Of course, this is kind of logical because Virges, what we call, um, it's a virtual mobile operator.

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think it is a VMO.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And they actually ride on team mobiles network.

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's, it's team mobiles antennas.

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Uh, in fact, often, um, if you go to select network, you select team mobile, but it'll say,

241
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Virgin on your phone.

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So they're just basically helped us.

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's all they have to do.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And, you know, and, and the cash register part is, uh, is also probably handled through

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
team mobiles infrastructure.

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So all they have to do is really have a couple people who, you know,

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
stand for the Virgin customer promise and answer the phone promptly.

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You know, it's, they don't have enough people.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So, and they can kind of understand.

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But to anyway, after we figured this all out, um, no problem.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Sir, in 24 hours, they'll be back on.

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So Monday, of course, it wasn't back on.

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Another 30 minute wait getting through very tedious.

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Um, oh, okay.

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Uh, it'll be unblacklisted now.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Turn your phone off for half an hour.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Then turn it back on and then it should be fine.

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Of course, it didn't work then.

259
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I waited a couple hours, didn't work.

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Um, called again went through the whole process.

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And you have to explain everything new because you can't, you know,

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
you can ask for team member Gareth.

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But, uh, he's on lunch break or I can't find him.

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Of course, the answer.

265
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So you have to go through the whole thing.

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Explaining how it all works.

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What happened?

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Uh, often telling them where the black list is.

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So that didn't work.

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So then I decided to go down to the virgin store in the high street.

271
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And you didn't know how I love going anywhere called high street.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Um, uh, and so virgin has a store in a store.

273
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Guess worst.

274
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
In WH Smith, which is kind of a general purpose, uh, magazine store,

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but also grocery store, not a grocery store, uh, household good store.

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And they have a corner, uh, in the back of this store.

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And it's a desk and they have, uh, I don't know.

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Um, it's not very big.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's, it's literally in the corner.

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And so there's Ian and Ian says, Oh, yeah, okay.

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I understand what's happened.

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've only been here for two days myself.

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And like, oh, okay, this guy has no connections within the company.

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So, but he tried to get through, you know,

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
same deal, turn it off for 20 minutes.

286
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Now we couldn't actually perform that test in the store because, uh,

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you cannot receive virgin mobile in the virgin mobile store in Gilbert.

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Uh, which is, of course, ludicrous.

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I've known about this, but this was kind of funny.

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because this Ian guy had only been there for two days.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He just discovered it as well.

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And he was tripping out.

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Uh, so I go outside and he says, No, wait 20 minutes.

294
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay, I'll go down.

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm hungry.

296
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm going on to Burger King.

297
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm going to have a hamburger, you know,

298
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Burger, hamburger meal, whatever the hell it is with a coke.

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So I'm eating there 30 minutes.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I make it safe.

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And I'd say, okay, you know, this is it.

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If it doesn't work now, then I'm, I'm taking different measures.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So, of course, it didn't work.

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then I just walked back to T-Mobile.

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Actually, I had been into Vodafone because I figured,

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
now I'm going to go shop.

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Went into Vodafone.

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Um, didn't like the attitude of the people,

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
salespeople there.

310
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So, you know, just, they'll have the same phones, basically.

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Then they went to T-Mobile.

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And there was a guy there who knew a lot about their service and

313
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
a lot about their products.

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And he could tell me, you know, how, um,

315
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you could get onto the Starbucks T-Mobile access points or

316
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
airports just by sending a text message.

317
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And it'll be automatically added to your account.

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Um, you know, so, of course, this is a contract that you have to,

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
uh, have to enter into to get all these wonderful services.

320
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They have a, um, a discounted rate, uh, for international dialing.

321
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So, yeah, it's still going to be kind of expensive.

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And roaming in the states, uh, it'll still be 69 cents, uh,

323
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
pence a minute.

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So that's, uh, way over the top.

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So it looks like I'm still going to have to use a different account in the

326
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
states when I'm there because it's just crazy.

327
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean, you pay for your incoming calls.

328
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So you're paying almost a buck, you know, that's, uh,

329
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
actually you are paying a dollar for an incoming per minute for

330
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
incoming calls.

331
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So that's not going to work.

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Do you have a good data bundles now for the UK only, of course,

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
uh, one gigabyte of data per month for 90 pounds.

334
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And then 75 pence per megabyte after that.

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So that, I mean, it's crazy.

336
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's still ridiculous amount of money, but okay,

337
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
that's better than I've seen.

338
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
In fact, if you're roaming, if I'd be in the states and use this account,

339
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
it would cost me £7.50 per megabyte.

340
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So that's like 15 bucks.

341
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, man, porn gets really expensive that way.

342
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Does it sound familiar to you?

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If so, domestic life.org is calling your name.

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Turn into this family safe podcast where a young married couple

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
discuss ups and downs of raising two small children in today's day and age.

346
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Again, that's domesticlife.org.

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
podcasting, it's Adam Curry.

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hello.

349
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Adam, this is Pohaku from JediTrainer.com.

350
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I think we've got a very unique podcast that helps people improve their lives

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
by using the power of their mind.

352
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let me give an example.

353
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay, you ready?

354
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want you to follow me on this.

355
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay.

356
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So back in your chair and I want you to relax.

357
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I want you to relax.

358
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Start from your head and move down to your shoulders.

359
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Get your torso moved down to your thighs, your legs, and your toes.

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay, now if you're all relaxed, here's what I want you to do.

361
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Get mad.

362
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Get mad while you stay relaxed.

363
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Guess what?

364
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You can't do it.

365
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
See, the mind and the body are one.

366
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Getting angry requires muscular tension.

367
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And if you stay relaxed, you can't get angry.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is just a little tip, a little sort of a sample of the kind of things that we do

Aloha.

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, you hear that?

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's already giving away a part of the big secret that I wasn't going to talk about.

380
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Shoot, see now I'm totally trapped in all these wires all on a second.

381
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
See, now there's that hum that I was talking about.

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll wrap it off from my...

383
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, man.

384
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What was that?

385
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, yeah.

386
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That was Patricia.

387
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh, man.

388
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hold on a second.

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Let me just call her back real quick.

390
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Tell her.

391
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Doing a show.

392
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
She's probably going to leave a message.

393
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay.

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So...

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hold on one second.

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay.

397
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
There we go.

398
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So now I'm going to see if I can get rid of that hum.

399
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh, hey.

400
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The whole studio is falling away.

401
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I got to do this differently.

402
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is...

403
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is not going to work.

404
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll just keep it like it is for this show.

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is not the way to do it.

406
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay.

407
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I like the T-Mobile guy.

408
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And he sold me something that I've been playing with for the...

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, of course, I had to play with it because...

410
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Well, it's an MDA, which is a pocket PC.

411
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, yes.

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can hear a mobile phone fan freaking out right now as we speak.

413
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And this is...

414
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What's cool about this is it had...

415
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And I've had the XDA, which was our...

416
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That was a heavy mod, man.

417
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That thing was.

418
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So this is definitely bigger than the...

419
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Then the size I'd like to carry with me as a phone.

420
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But as the guy in the store said,

421
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's big.

422
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's powerful.

423
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I said, huh?

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll tell my wife that when she looks at being...

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because one of those, you know, like, what the hell did you buy now?

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll say, huh?

427
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's big.

428
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And it's powerful.

429
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you slide the cover up, it reveals Presto.

430
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
A nice little keyboard in Quarty format.

431
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So you can use it with two thumbs kind of.

432
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And yeah, I can get pretty fast.

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It has all the pocket PC stuff in there and synchronization stuff, which, of course, does me know good,

434
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Because I had to get all of my phone numbers from my Mac, from my Mac address book, into the...

435
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Into the Windows world.

436
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And those two definitely don't want to talk to each other.

437
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There is a product out there that I'll point to on...

438
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And in the show notes, which actually adds it to icing.

439
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And we'll sync up your phone through USB, just like you do with any phone and icing.

440
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And I was about to order it.

441
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I was like, you know, it's like 50 bucks.

442
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's interesting because I thought, you know, that's like what castblast are cost,

443
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But you know, man, I really want it.

444
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So if it really is going to do the job for me, it'll be well worth it.

445
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Certainly worth hunting around, for other ways, to do this, to do this export import.

446
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And then I read that they hadn't yet come out with their tiger, compatible version,

447
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and apparently an icing in tiger is all different.

448
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So that was a bummer, but I'm going to keep my eye on those guys.

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So what I wound up doing is I use this other program.

450
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I forget what it's called, but I'm going to put a link to it.

451
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That essentially outputs your dress book as V cards.

452
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Then I was able to Bluetooth the V cards into the MDA, because of course it has Bluetooth and GPS,

453
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and all that groovy stuff.

454
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And then add them one by one into my dress book.

455
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So that worked reasonably well.

456
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And, you know, there's always loose some data,

457
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
or something gets messed up when you do that kind of stuff.

458
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But it worked out okay so far.

459
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And so then the coolest part about this is it has Wi-Fi built right in.

460
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And if it detects a Wi-Fi network, it'll use any internet applications.

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We'll use that Wi-Fi network, and it connects automatically.

462
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And it's actually pretty damn good.

463
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So what is the most exciting part about this?

464
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Is that Skype now makes a pocket PC version available of Skype?

465
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And it works.

466
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I've had some issues with some people.

467
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I think if you really don't have the bandwidth,

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
then you know, stuff starts to go a little wacky.

469
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm quite sure.

470
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And it's primarily on the receiving end, where it screws up a bit,

471
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
or maybe the process is working too hard.

472
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I mean, there's a billion things that could be wrong.

473
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I haven't quite figured out the perfect configuration for using Skype

474
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
with the built-in Wi-Fi.

475
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But it's unbelievable how nicely integrated this is.

476
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You can go into your address book, search for a number,

477
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and then you can select, you can just hit the call button,

478
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and it'll call that person to the cell phone network,

479
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
or you can say call with Skype.

480
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And it'll use your Skype out automatically.

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's just fucking amazing.

482
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So I'm very pleased with this thing right now.

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And I will continue to report on the progress.

484
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But right now, it's just great.

485
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You know, my Skype is in my pocket.

486
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I love it.

487
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The web browser works.

488
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, no, it's all pretty cool.

489
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
All right.

490
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Let's roll out some pod save music right now.

491
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This is one that was brought to my attention by PW Fenton,

492
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
as he programmed it into the pod show on serious.

493
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's Christian Dozler and the honey Greek bookie.

494
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Quick bookie.

495
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay.

496
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Okay.

497
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Okay.

498
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Okay.

499
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay.

500
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay.

501
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Okay.

502
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay.

503
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay.

504
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay.

505
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay.

506
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay.

507
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Okay.

508
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Okay.

509
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay.

510
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Okay.

511
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay.

512
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay.

513
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Okay.

514
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay.

515
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay.

516
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Okay.

517
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay.

518
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay.

519
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Okay.

520
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

521
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay.

522
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Okay.

523
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay.

524
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay.

525
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Okay.

526
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay.

527
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Okay.

528
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Okay.

529
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Okay.

530
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Okay.

531
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Okay.

532
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Okay.

533
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay.

534
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay.

535
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay.

536
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Okay.

537
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay.

538
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Okay.

539
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Okay.

540
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay.

541
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay.

542
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Okay.

543
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay.

544
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Okay.

545
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Okay.

546
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Okay.

547
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay.

548
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay.

549
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay.

550
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Okay.

551
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay.

552
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay.

553
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Okay.

554
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Okay.

555
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

556
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Okay.

557
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay.

558
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Okay.

559
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay.

560
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay.

561
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Great.

562
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Wait.

563
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What's your secret?

564
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's No secret, Dongkin.

565
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's Provisile.

566
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:46,780
I don't actually know, but as long as I'm shooting below par, I'm not going to ask.

567
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
Sounds great!

568
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,120
You think all that miscovee would prescribe some provisional for me?

569
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Mind you, I'm no doctor, but the way I see it, provisils good for everybody.

570
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
So far as I know.

571
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,760
But as you said, you're not a doctor.

572
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
That's right, pumpkin.

573
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm just an ordinary guy who takes a lot of drugs.

574
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
And gauze, like a son of a bitch.

575
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Provisile is not for everyone.

576
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Consult the physician before taking provisile.

577
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Do not take provisile if you're just food on a daily basis.

578
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Side effects may include nausea vomiting, headache, stomach rams,

579
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
business confusion, liver and kidney failure,

580
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
energy loss of mental acuity, diarrhea, shortness of bread,

581
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
chest pains, swollen testicles, irritated bowel pigeon toes,

582
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,760
respiratory inflammation, permanent blindness, loss of sexual motivation,

583
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,760
pancreatic dysfunction, googleize, polio, and temporary ducking of the stool.

584
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
I just found that.

585
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
On my hard drive, I was putting the show together,

586
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
and I got to play this.

587
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
I don't even know if I was supposed to play that.

588
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,760
I think that was, no, I'm pretty sure that was PWFenton,

589
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
but I think it was all PWFenton.

590
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Him and his electronic bag of tricks, very, very cool.

591
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,760
By the way, I think I know what I want.

592
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,760
That I have to have some kind of work desk.

593
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Pod, let's call it podcast desk build.

594
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
There will be a stand-up desk.

595
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
I think it's just so much easier.

596
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
I don't mind standing while doing stuff.

597
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,760
If I could just have everything, and maybe it's curved a little,

598
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
so I can kind of stand in it a little,

599
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,760
and then have a choice of operating the mixer.

600
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,760
The mic can come from high down instead of over to the right,

601
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
or over from the left,

602
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
and then I'd have high stools.

603
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,760
If I wanted to, I could kind of, like a bar stool, I could sit on that.

604
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
That's what I'll have to have made.

605
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Maybe when it's a little bit cooler.

606
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,760
So all the news today, of course, dominated by the fact that,

607
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:41,760
and I predicted this, that the authorities know who the terrorist suicide bombers were,

608
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
because they were suicide bombers.

609
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,760
This was a simultaneous bit of news in the London bombings.

610
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,760
And this is what kind of your worst fear is,

611
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,760
these were British boys born and raised in the UK.

612
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:05,760
And basically, they were influenced by, well, we'll find out, hopefully,

613
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,760
whatever factors to do this.

614
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,760
But that came from inside the country.

615
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
And so I didn't predict that.

616
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,760
What I did predict is that they would figure this out

617
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,760
through the CCTV cameras, London is so wired.

618
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,760
So they literally were able to follow the route of this bus,

619
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
and see who got on and make a lot of deductions,

620
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
and they did raids on their houses,

621
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
and all this happened very, very quickly.

622
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,760
So, first of all, that's great.

623
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,760
I think that's an amazing bit of work has been done there.

624
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
And now we have to kind of figure out,

625
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
what was the background of these four?

626
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,760
What was going on?

627
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,760
How did they get so influenced to, you know,

628
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
basically, you have to be brainwashed, I think,

629
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
to do this one way or the other.

630
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,760
I mean, it's not human nature to want to kill yourself.

631
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,760
So, yeah, this is tough times.

632
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
And there's a lot of conversation going on.

633
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,760
And I must say, Auntie, the BBC is doing a great job

634
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
during all this.

635
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,760
They've got great coverage, great shows, great guests,

636
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
well prepared.

637
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,760
There's not too much drama footage, although it's there,

638
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,760
but, you know, there's not a lot of flags

639
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,760
and fighter planes shooting overhead with fanfare.

640
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,760
It's just real good reporting, and I'm very impressed,

641
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,760
and still very impressed by the Londoners.

642
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,760
See, update on the health situation,

643
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
still tingling in the index finger.

644
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
The shoulder still messed up.

645
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
I've got my exercises that I have to do.

646
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
It's definitely not spasming as bad as it was,

647
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,760
but oh, man, it's very, very irritating.

648
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Especially when you are typing in the keyboard,

649
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,760
and you use your index finger a lot,

650
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
and you type on the keys, and it's like,

651
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,760
almost like there's a little bit of novocaine in there.

652
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Yeah, I know.

653
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
None of this sounds too good.

654
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Does it look low?

655
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Oh, wait, sorry, is this one?

656
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Okay, this is Jim from the Life of Jim Podcast.

657

Talk about exhaust gaming, photography, video, and computers.

660
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
I made it to a skid, play around with some music.

661
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,760
I'll have my family on, as yes, just to make the investing.

662
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760

Submit at podshow.com.

675
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,760
The multitudes went forth

676
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,760
and cast their pods in the direction of all who would listen.

677
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,760
And casting their pods in this manner,

678
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,760
they were henceforth known as podcasters.

679
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Take it in your ear.

680
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,760
One galley casting with Adam Curry.

681
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Y'all done.

682
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
It's time for the hit to go.

683
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
With y'all, Polar.

684
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Hey, Johnny Boy.

685
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Hello, Adam. This is not a hit test.

686
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
I'm going to start right away.

687
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
All right. Here's intro.

688
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Number one.

689
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Right to the business.

690
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Okay.

691
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
SOS Band.

692
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Two.

693
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
SOS Band.

694
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
I...

695
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
That... that... that...

696
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Just be...

697
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
Man, it's too good to be.

698
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Love is in the air.

699
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
John Paul Young.

700
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Number one.

701
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Easy.

702
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Easy one.

703
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
And the final one is number three.

704
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Oh, I love that.

705
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
That's crowded house during treatment's over.

706
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Man, I think I got him all this time.

707
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
Somewhere we have a live version of that

708
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
that we did in one of our radio shows.

709
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Back in the early 80s.

710
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
You're listening to the hit test.

711
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
Everybody.

712
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
John, Polar.

713
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,760
And this is the first answer in today's hit test.

714
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760

And I think that we're gonna come with some

765
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,400
Solutions that maybe we can do to help each other. I think that's

766
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
How convoluted was that?

767
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,320
We're working on it. We put out some suggestions. I had some ideas to make it easier for everybody because you know

768
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,720
Directory building business is tough work. I know we have

769
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,280
120 node managers who are patiently working on my father dot org. So it's not trivial

770
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,240
But I think we got some solutions. Hopefully we'll be able to talk about this way

771
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,080
