00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charity 2, 4, 9-Ear

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm Korean

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I like to think I'm flying into the street

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is Thursday, September 29th, in the year of our Lord 2005

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, day to the next day to the last coming year from Curricondo

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In northern California, sunny San Francisco

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I know it's not a kind of boring, but for those you just

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Tooting into the daily stores code via Syria, satellite channel 103

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey, it never rains in California

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, maybe it does, not when I'm here

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, man

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A show of all shows

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Filled up with pot-safe music

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's able to find a couple of nice promos

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And of course, we've got to talk about today being the first day

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That the pot squad, which is an extensive lineup

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Various on a day-to-day basis, we're basically being cymbal cast

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Four hours a day on Syria, satellite radio

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's really weird, I'm doing the same show, but I'm still cognizant of this new audience and there, you know

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So we welcome you, if you're wondering who I am, what the hell I'm doing on your satellite radio

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm Adam Curry

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm just the middle-aged white guy

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The mild case of Tourette syndrome

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And what's the show about?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, I'm much really, it's kind of like a jumping off point

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a place for you to listen to stuff to then go discover your own podcast, dammit

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The power of all the world is to us

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And all seriousness, there is some really important stuff to talk about

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Like, well, like some buddies in mind

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Actually, this is a mini mix that a friend of mine did Ben Libre on to

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I started off on the radio with that we were doing stuff

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Man is early in 1982, I think, and he was, he remix

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He was basically remix, remember those guys?

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Remixers before they start to do mashups

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Some kind of DJs

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, someone found a mashup, a good old-banded

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I think you'll see here

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Just while I love working with the guy

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sweet dreams

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Morty contenty, remix

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
On the daily source code, nice stuff

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I've been

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,560
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Sweet dreams are made of the answer

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Who am I to disagree?

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,560
And travel the world and the seven seas

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Everybody's looking for something

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Some of them want to use you

65
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Some of them want to get used by you

66
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Some of them want to use you

67
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Some of them want to be used

68
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Some of them want to fear you

69
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Some of them want to fear you

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Some of them want to fear you

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

73
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:56,560
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah you yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah,

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Sweet dreams and make you the champions

100
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

102
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

103
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

105
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

106
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

107
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

108
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

109
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

110
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,560
We'll be with you in my dreams

111
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Typical pen

112
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
He always ends his mashups and mixes

113
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,560
I was from 2001

114
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
That's four years old

115
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,560
This is how far ahead of the times this guy is

116
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
As I said, I've worked with him since 82

117
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
He was doing the grand mix

118
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
If you're into the mixing, then you know about the DMC mixes

119
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
He did lots of those

120
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
He's on plenty of remixes that have gone on to become

121
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Number one hits, let's see

122
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Lovely day, Bill Widders, remix of that

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
To Varus

124
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
I know it sounds kind of...

125
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
If you haven't heard it, it sounds kind of

126
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Flaky that there would be remixes

127
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
If heaven must be missing an angel

128
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
But it truly does kick ass

129
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Oh, what a night

130
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Four seasons

131
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
And he's produced a couple of his own albums

132
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
And it's...you know what?

133
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
It's interesting because he's from the Netherlands

134
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
As is DJ Tiesto

135
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Tase as we know him

136
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Do you know it does you?

137
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Find Dutch name

138
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
It must be something

139
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
What is that? What am I hearing?

140
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
There's so much construction going on outside the condo

141
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Right now in two years, this is going to be a great neighborhood

142
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
But right now, it's almost looking directly at the crane operator

143
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
And I'm on the 24th floor

144
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Must be something in the water over there

145
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
In the Netherlands that's doing it for

146
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
You know, I should call Ben, I haven't spoken to him

147
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
God, man, probably a year or more

148
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Maybe even I got to call him

149
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Because he's the kind of guy that understands

150
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
That you need to give a little to get a little

151
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
So if he's working on some cool projects

152
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I'm sure he'll give us, he'll

153
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
He'll, he'll pot, say, for five, some of his mixes

154
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
So that we can play him

155
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Um, so there is some actual potsafe

156
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Use it coming up

157
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
I just want to tell you about what we're doing on Sirius

158
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Because that kicks off today

159
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
On channel 103, it's Sirius Stars

160
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Which is the channel that

161
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
It's amazing how they brought together

162
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Madge Weinstein, Don Andrew Adam Curry and

163
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Cousin Brucey

164
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
So at 6 o'clock

165
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
As will be the case every week

166
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Afternoon, it's Eastern Time

167
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Three Pacific Daily Source Code will be on

168
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,560
And this is all kind of like a simultaneous

169
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
These are the shows that

170
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Most of them come out as a podcast first

171
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
And then they go on Sirius

172
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
That's a timing issue

173
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I'm actually up early here in San Francisco

174
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
To make sure that we have this show ready for

175
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
For Sirius today

176
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
So after the source code

177
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
We get Madge Weinstein

178
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
That of course is East Radio

179
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Our angry bloated Jewish Lesbian from Chicago

180
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Don Andrew followed by that

181
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
And there will be

182
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Other types of shows just like these

183
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
That you're hearing throughout the week

184
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I'll let you know what's going on

185
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Attention Tech with Steve Gilmore

186
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
That's going to be a brand new podcast

187
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm looking forward to hearing

188
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
I think he's teaming up with Mike Fizzard on that

189
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
Then we have DVD weekly Don Iran

190
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
And then later on the evening

191
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
We roll out to some pod safe music

192
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Also Brian knows the Frank Truth

193
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
We've got Peter

Cool new feature coming out

226
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
I think that releasing it today on the podcast

227
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Music network music dot pod show dot com

228
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
This is where we we're building the new music industry

229
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Taking place before you're very eyes

230
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Thousands of tracks that podcasters can choose from to play

231
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
And they're reporting what they're playing

232
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
We've talked about this before

233
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,560
So we know what the top pod plays are and how many

234
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
What would it be called?

235
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
I mean you can't call them spins anymore

236
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Because we're not really spinning CDs

237
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Certainly not in most cases not vinyl

238
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Hmm okay

239
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
So the top pod play MP3s that are being played

240
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
From the pod safe music network on

241
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,560
We have over like 2,000 podcasters now registered

242
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
And tons of other people who are not podcasters

243
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
But I interested in

244
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Licensing this pod safe music for movies

245
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,560
And commercials and all kinds of amazing stuff

246
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
So we have this top pod play

247
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
And now we've expanded that i saw the beta

248
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Hmm

249
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Came in last night i saw this morning

250
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,560
So now we know the top pod play of all time

251
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
The top pod play of the month

252
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
To date the top pod play of the week

253
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,560
To date and the top pod play of the day

254
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
So this is now and now we're getting some information

255
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
It's really useful and there's a lot of stuff in there

256
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
I really love this feature because

257
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
It saves me out of a lot of time of going through

258
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
You know and sampling everything

259
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
I always listen to a couple of genres

260
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
See what's coming and look listen to the new submissions

261
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
But really knowing what someone else is playing

262
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
It helps a lot

263
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,560
And the cruise box still getting an amazing amount of play

264
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,560
And i keep reminding myself i got to keep on that stuff

265
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Man

266
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
We're going to make hits

267
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
We don't have to do it right

268
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Just like traditional radio played over and over

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
And over and over and over again

270
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
He'll make you feel

271
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Can they be a fucking stop play

272
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
And i'll buy the record already

273
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Okay

274
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,560

282
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Your first computer

283
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,560
That piece of shit was like a freaking roller-roader

284
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Now we've got Wi-Fi

292
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Me that song

294
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Seeing a loud mash it up

295

Kick it

327
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Hurt it on a podcast

328
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
That's right

329
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Revolution is on

330
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
I got to get a new version of that

331
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
So it's

332
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I really can't wait to be back at the cottage

333
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
I'm going

334
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
I was supposed to be New York today

335
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Actually but

336
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
The way things work out

337
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
And some stuff that has to happen

338
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
In Europe I'm flying directly

339
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
From San Francisco

340
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
To London tomorrow

341
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
On Virgin upper class

342
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Yes, they're picking me up again

343
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Love the limo service

344
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Love what they're doing

345
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,560
So far I've had not really one bad experience

346
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,560
So I'm flying back directly

347
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
And I gotta tell you

348
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm, besides seeing the girls

349
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Obviously I'm really looking forward

350
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
To seeing Patricia and Christina

351
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,560
But I also want to get back to the studio

352
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,560
I got my, I'm missing the

353
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
The valve, the valve

354
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
The valve processor

355
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
And some people have complained about

356
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
The road set up

357
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
I think I have to tweak a little bit

358
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Problem is I don't really have any reference speakers

359
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
With me, you know, you got to that one pair of speakers

360
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
That you listen to and you know what it sounds like

361
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
And you trust it so that's at home

362
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
The other home

363
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
And so I've got to, I've got to tweak the sound a bit

364
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
For what I'm on the road

365
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Besides that being back

366
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
It's always cool because

367
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
You get to have that

368
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Welcome home honey sex

369
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Waiting, waiting for that

370
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Thinkin' of it

371
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,560
So I'd said two days ago

372
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
Was it Monday, maybe thing Monday show

373
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,560
I said that I was a big fan of the distorted view show

374
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Fan of that too

375
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
But what I meant to say was

376
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
The Pacific Coast Hellway

377
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
And that I'd listen to the show

378
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
And as we're subscribed to the podcast

379
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
And the host was right in on me

380
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
And so I mentioned that

381
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
And last night I came back after

382
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
After a fantastic dinner

383
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
By the way, some friends

384
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Cooked a homemade meal for me

385
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
I was really cool

386
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Shatobriol

387
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
And lots of mashed potatoes

388
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,560
And so I got back to the condo

389
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
I had the

390
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
I had iTunes open

391
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
So it had slurped stuff down

392
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Even on the slow stolen Wi-Fi connection

393
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
I've got here

394
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
More about that later in the show

395
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
And there was brand new Pacific Coast Hellway

396
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
I could tell from the show notes

397
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Or actually from the title of the

398
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Not the show notes

399
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
The show notes are the same

400
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
But from the title of the podcast

401
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
That I was going to be in it

402
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
So I wanted to play that for you

403
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Because

404
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
I thought it was just one guy

405
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
But it appears that he has a team

406
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
And that there is a lot of people

407
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Actually work on this show

408
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
They did some good work

409
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Check this out from Pacific Coast Hellway

410
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Anyway, so get this

411
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
So Adam Curry

412
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
mentioned our show

413
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
On his podcast

414
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
On the Daily Source Code

415
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
This past Monday

416
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
So hold on, let me play this

417
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Yeah, that was a great podcast

418
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I was listening to

419
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Over the weekend

420
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Pacific Coast Hellway

421
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
This guy is good

422
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,560
He does a podcast on his way to work

423
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Every single morning

424
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
And I guess he records pieces of it

425
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
And he must do some post editing

426
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
If not, he's got a great mobile set up

427
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
And he's funny man

428
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
He is

429
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
If I got a very Howard Stern

430
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Ask Moment or Experience

431
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
I mean, I was

432
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
When I lived in New York

433
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
And I was commuting into this

434
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Or a New Jersey

435
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
And commuting to the city

436
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Every day

437
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Always would listen to Stern

438
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Even the

439
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Even the best of repeats we'd listen to

440
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
And sometimes you get sick of it

441
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
And wouldn't listen to it

442
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
For a week or two

443
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
And then you'd invariably always come back

444
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
And I was such a big fan

445
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
I remember

446
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Whenever Howard Stern

447
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
We're talking about me on the air

448
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
He would always say

449
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I was a dick

450
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
And it hurt

451
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Because it was such a fan of the show

452
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
And so I'm listening to this

453
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Pacific Coast Hellway

454
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Andrew Grummit

455
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Developer for iPod Element

456
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Turn me on to it

457
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
And

458
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
He played one show

459
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Which was pretty funny

460
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
And so then I subscribed to the podcast

461
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
And I've been listening

462
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
And also

463
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
And he this guy say

464
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Adam Curry, that big-haired fact

465
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
It was the same thing

466
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
He's like, oh man

467
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
I'm such a fan of the show

468
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
And well, to be honest

469
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
He's an equal opportunity

470
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
A fender

471
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
He definitely slams everybody

472
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
It's not for the

473
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
For the

474
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
We could heart

475
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
I guess that podcast

476
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
But I love it though

477
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Because it is

478
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
It's the guys a great writer

479
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
And he's got bits on there

480
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Check it out

481
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Pacific Coast Hellway.com

482
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Wow

483
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
So how fucking cool

484
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Is that?

485
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Wow

486
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Adam Curry blowing sunshine

487
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Up my skirt

488
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
And after I made him cry

489
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
So

490
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
I'm such a dick

491
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
You did

492
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
But you know

493
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Now that you mentioned it

494
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Adam

495
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
I do feel kind of bad

496
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,560
Calling you a big-haired

497
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Fag

498
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
I mean, let's be honest

499
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
You don't have big air

500
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
So

501
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
So anyway

502
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,560
I was playing this clip of this Adam Curry clip

503
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
To my wife

504
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
And she was

505
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
She's listening to it

506
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
She's like

507
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
What's that noise

508
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
He's making there at the beginning

509
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
You know

510
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
There was this great podcast

511
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
I was listening

512
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
So I isolated

513
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Yeah

514
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
There was

515
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I put it through an EQ

516
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Compressed it

517
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
We're in a whole thing through

518
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Like a multiplex filter

519
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
So you can hear exactly

520
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
What Adam's doing

521
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah

522
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
There was this great podcast

523
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
I was listening to

524
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
I guess he really is a big fan

525
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Fan

526
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Adam

527
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
I said fan

528
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Okay

529
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
And you know the funny thing

530
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Was that

531
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
We listen to a show

532
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
We listen to a daily source code

533
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,560
And we were already

534
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
Reading a tribute

535
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
To Adam Curry

536
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Even before we knew he was even listening

537
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
We hear today

538
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
To pay tribute

539
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
To a great man

540
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Whether it was

541
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
As a big-haired Fag

542
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
MTV VJ

543
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Or

544
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Or

545
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Or

546
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Or

547
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Or

548
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Or

549
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
As the big-haired Fag

550
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Inventor of podcasting

551
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Adam Curry

552
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Has seen our nation

553
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Through times of great change

554
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Adam Curry

555
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Who skillfully bridged the gap

556
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
Between MTV's mother Quinn

557
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
And MTV's Kennedy

558
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Adam Curry

559
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Who brought us the music of Paula Abdul

560
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Vanilla Ice

561
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
And that guy who said

562
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Wired Up

563
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
Today

564
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Adam spends his twilight years

565
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
At his cottage in England

566
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Steering out at the sea

567
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,560
A waiting the sweet embrace of death

568
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
And so

569
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
We salute you

570
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Adam Curry

571
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
The greatest American

572
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Who ever lived

573
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Who's also a big-haired Fag

574
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,560
So Adam

575
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Hey man

576
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Glad to have your board dude

577
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
And if you really are fan

578
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Dig the show

579
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Hey, let's do some business, okay?

580
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Oh crying

581
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Oh man

582
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
It's the second time I've heard it

583
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
And it's just as good as the first time

584
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
So I went to my mic up there

585
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Of course

586
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Dude

587
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
You've done

588
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
We've got a deal

589
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Absolutely

590
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
You're signed up

591
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
That was really real

592
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
I really

593
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
I really really enjoyed that

594
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Oh man

595
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Okay

596
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Let me see

597
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I've taken notes here on the blackberry

598
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
I've got to talk about today

599
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Oh

600
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,560
I was given this most fabulous fabulous gift

601
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
It is a neon

602
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
And I'm talking about

603
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Let me see

604
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
That's probably about

605
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
The neon's going to be almost

606
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
It's probably about three feet

607
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Why is it almost about a yard

608
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Wide

609
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
And at least a foot and a half high

610
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
And it's in blue

611
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
And

612
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
No green

613
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
And it's two words

614
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
It says the pod father

615
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
And the green

616
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
I think pod fathers

617
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
And kind of like a

618
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Purpleish blueish color

619
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
And so that's

620
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
What is that?

621
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
The perfect gift for me or what?

622
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
So of course having the curry condo

623
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Which is basically my bachelor

624
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
The bachelor pad

625
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
I never had

626
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
So I get all the benefits

627
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Right

628
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
I get to have the

629
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
The godny neon here

630
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
In the condo

631
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
And it's not godny

632
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
It's fucking beautiful

633
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
I love it

634
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
You know guys understand that stuff

635
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
You know if you could choose

636
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
By the way

637
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
I mean a Budweiser neon

638
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
And something with your own name on it

639
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
How cool is that

640
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
I actually get a lot of the benefit

641
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Of having a bachelor pad

642
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
I just don't have all the girlfriends

643
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
To clean it for me

644
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Oh bummer

645
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
So here's the plan

646
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
And it actually has to be delivered to me

647
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Because it's big

648
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
And you can't just

649
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
And it has no box

650
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
These things don't come in a box

651
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
They're custom made

652
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Although they should come in a custom made box

653
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
So I can take it with me on my roadshow

654
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
For advertisers and marketers

655
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Put down the MM50

656
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Logitech speaker set

657
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
And the pod father neon

658
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
And we're good to go

659
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Now so what I want to do is

660
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
And hopefully it's arriving today

661
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
I'm going to turn it around

662
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
And I'm going to point it out

663
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Out towards the outside

664
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Because I have these

665
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Floor to ceiling windows

666
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
So it'll be on the 24th floor

667
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
I'll have this neon

668
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
That'll be like a beacon

669
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,560
A beacon of light

670
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,560
In the near the financial district of San Francisco

671
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Now they turned off the Bank of America building

672
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Someone's got to provide me the beacon of this area

673
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
So it might as well be me

674
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560

I'm kind of digging her angrieness

701
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
It feels really good

702

I can't get no satisfaction

713
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
I ask the guy I want his advice

714
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
And I want to go with dinner

715
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560

717
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560

725
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Where he began to beg

726
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
I didn't lick his bones

727
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
And looked at me in the wildly

728
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
One mile leg

729
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
He was distracted right

730
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Before he was wedged by his feet

731
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
But now all the pooms run

732
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
That my house wasn't funky

733
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Cold with dinner

734
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Ding ding ding

735
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
So I took him to my crib

736
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
And everything would be well as planned

737
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
I wish he got a dress

738
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
It wasn't a big old mess

739
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
He's singing a love of the man

740
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
So I want him to walk back

741
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
I don't want him to walk back

742
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
But then I was surprised when he went up

743
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
He must be sure that he'd always feel a poor poor cold

744
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
But dinner

745
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
You know what I'm saying

746
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
You're good

747
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Hey, no plans with a man

748
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
This is the 80s

749
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
And nobody's down with the lady

750
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Remember tone load man

751
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
That was a revolution on MTV

752
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Back in the day

753
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
He did that video

754
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
What the word was

755
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
He did it for 100 bucks

756
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
It must have cost more than 100 bucks

757
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,560
But it was a very very very low budget

758
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
That was number one with funky cold medina

759
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Damn

760
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Remember that

761
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
If

762
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Oh

763
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
All of the mashups by the way

764
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
And I don't have a hit test today

765
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
I saw young palettes and sent one in

766
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Just as I was starting to record

767
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
So I'll save that one for tomorrow

768
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
So I'll have a hit test number

769
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Was it 62 already

770
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,560
So I've noticed that the iTunes links are showing up

771
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
In the show notes

772
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
I'm loving loving the wiki show notes

773
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
I'm not quite sure what happened

774
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Or what we did different

775
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Still not quite sure how it works

776
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,560
But the show notes are really really kicking

777
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
So basically I'm linking to

778
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
To the show notes from

779
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
From dailysourcecode.com

780
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
If you're just

781
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Listening to this podcast for the first time

782
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
What the hell are show notes

783
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
So instead of me reading out

784
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
You were else to you

785
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Where to go and find stuff

786
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Like some of the promos that you hear

787
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Or some of the pod safe music

788
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Or the mashups

789
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Anything based on the show

790
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
You can go to dailysourcecode.com

791
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
You can also go to curry.com

792
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Both places work www.curry.com

793
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Dailysourcecode.com

794
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
From there you'll find a link to the show notes

795
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
The show notes is interactive

796
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
That we're testing

797
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
The wiki show notes

798
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Which is just a great name

799
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Anyone who's name is wiki

800
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
I will hire on the spot

801
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Can come and work for us right here at Pod Jo

802
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,560
I don't care what your skill set is

803
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
If your name is wiki

804
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
That's your real name

805
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
You're hired

806
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Hi I'm wiki

807
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
I work for Pod Show

808
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,560
So it's a collaborative writing environment

809
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
And what I'm seeing now

810
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Is that besides the fact that

811
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
People are going by the timecodes

812
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Even the putting timecodes in

813
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
And probably my clue set it up

814
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
Is probably doing the first bit

815
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
Getting it started with the timecodes

816
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Everything that's discussed on the show

817
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Show's up in writing

818
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
With links

819
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,560
And so for instance

820
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
I'm sure the tonaloke

821
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Funke called Medina

822
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
If it's on iTunes

823
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Which it probably is

824
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
They'll be a link to it

825
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
You can buy it

826
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,560
So

827
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
It's pretty cool

828
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
And there's also a place to comment

829
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Now I'm seeing that the comments

830
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Are showing up as a part of the wiki

831
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
I really got a

832
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
I really got to get into this

833
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Someone told me yesterday

834
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
That wordpress

835
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Which is

836
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
It's a weblog software

837
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Which is

838
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
When I'm moving to eventually

839
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
To do my show notes on

840
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
It has a wiki plugin

841
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Or something like that

842
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Boy this

843
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Mike is shitty

844
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
It has a wiki plugin

845
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Plugin

846
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
So that you can

847
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,560
I guess you can post your show notes

848
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Or something and get it going

849
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
And then that can be edited

850
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
I got to check it out

851
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
You know who lives in this building

852
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Matt and Mullenwegg

853
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
He's the guy who invented wordpress

854
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
I met him in the lobby

855
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
The other day

856
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
I'd met him originally at Nomdex

857
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
And Seattle

858
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
We did shoot that seems like ages ago

859
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
That was a 49 episode to go

860
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Episode number 200

861
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
We did that on stage

862
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
The closing keynote

863
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
And so I met him there

864
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
And I was like

865
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Cool software for sure

866
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
And we actually talked about

867
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
The multi-user software

868
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
There's some stuff that they had just

869
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Taking out of beta into release

870
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,560
So he lives in the building

871
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
We've exchanged numbers

872
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
So I got to hook up with him again

873
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
So that we can

874
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Yeah so that we can talk about

875
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Stuff like that

876
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Yiki stuff

877
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
And I will report back

878
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
As always

879
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,560
Let's say have

880
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Oh yeah

881
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,560
Here's some disappointing news

882
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
So I'm all jacked up

883
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
About bio diesel

884
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
I've got

885
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Where's it?

886
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm getting rid of the Audi A8

887
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
In a couple of months

888
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
And looking to see what I'm going to buy

889
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
To replace it

890
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
I want to diesel

891
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
That I can throw vegetable oil in

892
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Or my ultimate dream is get

893
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Chris Rockwell from the daily download

894
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
To basically be my filling station

895
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
To poop in my tank and make it go

896
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
And it's quite apparent

897
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
You can use a lot of real raw oil

898
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,560
The materials to make your diesel engine fire up

899
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Apparently in the United Kingdom

900
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Where I was planning on having this car

901
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
You have to pay

902
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Was it 27 pence?

903
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
27 pence?

904
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
It's like 50

905
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Oh that's yeah

906
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
It's 55

907
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
U.S.

908
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Dollar cents

909
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Tax per liter

910
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560
If you're using fucking vegetable oil

911
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
You have to...

912
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
What am I going to do?

913
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
I'm going to...

914
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
That's frustrating man

915
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Well clearly they're way ahead of the game over there

916
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
The government's already figured out that

917
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
This is going to be a great alternative fuel

918
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
And they're already taxing it

919
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
I'm not quite sure

920
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Someone asked to send me some more

921
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
But put it on the wiki please

922
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Point to the information on

923
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
If I'm creating a couple of gallons

924
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Worth of

925
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Biodesally my garage

926
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Which as you know

927
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
I'm really going to do

928
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,560
How do I pay the government

929
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Do I just keep track of what I pumped into the car

930
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
And then send them off a check

931
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
Or how does that work?

932
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
Or do I...

933
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Or do...

934
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Maybe they have a official place where you can purchase

935
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Biodesally

936
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
I don't know

937
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Pretty interesting though

938
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
I...

939
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
I don't understand

940
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
I don't understand how you can tax somebody

941
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
For vegetable oil if you're going to cook with it

942
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,560
But then the minute you have another use for it

943
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
You know that's a rip-off man

944
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
That is a freaking rip-off

945
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,560
But I have to talk to the authorities about that

946
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Dammit

947
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Hi

948
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560

And we're from there

951

A cartoon dog

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
He got down with the jaw harp

980
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,560
You miss Dawn making fun of cartoon characters with disabilities

981
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Did Charlie Brown have leukemia?

982
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Dawn insults people she went to high school with

983
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
This one kid Jason I went to school with

984
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
You a smell like capy

985
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
And Dawn insults us all

986
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
You don't fucking idiot

987
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
History was made folks

988
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Back to the jaw harp

989
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Yeah

990
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Chuck this out you guys

991
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
I'm so excited right now

992
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Because in my hands

993
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
For the first time in my life

994
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Is a jaw harp

995
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Or some people call them Jew harps

996
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Dawn plays the jaw harp for the very first time

997
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Let's see if I could do it

998
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Hold on, I'm so excited right now

999
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Hold on

1000
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Ow my tooth

1001
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,560
There's nerves in your teeth

1002
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
I need a lesson

1003
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
You got to do it closer to the mic

1004
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Okay, hold on

1005
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
There you go

1006
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Let's sing a little bit

1007
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
You're hearing history right now

1008
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Because you'll remember

1009
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
You'll think back and go

1010
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
I was there the first time

1011
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Dawn played that

1012
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
I shared that moment

1013
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I was there the moment

1014
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Her tooth shattered

1015
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
I still got it

1016
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Open your world man

1017
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
And how can we forget Dawn's trip

1018
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
To the YMCA

1019
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
I could tell you about something amazing

1020
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
What?

1021
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I went to step aerobics today

1022
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
At the YMCA

1023
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
That's not amazing

1024
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
So

1025
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,560
The instructor who hopefully

1026
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Doesn't ever listen to this

1027
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,560
She had like this little line of pussy sweat

1028
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Really?

1029
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Around her pussy

1030
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
No

1031
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
There's a little bit of sweat line

1032
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
And I was like

1033
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
I'm so excited right now

1034
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,560
I can't stop looking at that pussy sweat space

1035
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
Her camel toe was sweating

1036
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Did you like point it out to your stepmates

1037
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
So don't miss another episode of the Dawn and Drew Show

1038
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Or else Dawn might say

1039
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Are you fucking loser?

1040
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
I'll show a dot com

1041
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Recommend listening with it

1042

At least one foot firmly planted in reality

1043
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Well

1044
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
What can I say?

1045
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Oaks

1046
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
With a guy like this in charge

1047
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
You can at least count your blessings

1048
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
That the music is great

1049
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560

Listening to the RFL podcast

1092
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,560
Has been shown to be highly addictive

1093
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,560
I did that Saturday night special podcast

1094
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
From the condo

1095
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,560
And I played a couple of non-pod safe tunes

1096
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560

1097
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,560

The Buma Stemera

1104
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Have basically said you know what

1105
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Not only do we have a license for podcasters

1106
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
But this is the way to do it

1107
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
And it's interesting because they've basically put their foot down

1108
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
And said alright

1109
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,560
This is a performance just like radio

1110
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
So pay up

1111
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,560
And the record industry has been kind of silent about it

1112
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,560
So what we're seeing now is a whole slew of podcasts

1113
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
Originating over there

1114
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Where the podcasts are paying their license fee

1115
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Which is very low

1116
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I like that because these guys are definitely smart about it

1117
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,560
You know this is long tail stuff

1118
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,560
It's much better to get 50 bucks a year

1119
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Or 50 bucks a month or whatever

1120
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
Let's say 50 bucks a year

1121
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
I like that much better

1122
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
From a million podcasters

1123
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Then it is to try and have them track the songs they played

1124
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
And revenue based

1125
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,560
Sliding scales

1126
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,560
I'll never work it'll never scale

1127
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
Literally so

1128
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
Condon's podcast

1129
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
Where she plays

1130
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,560
But an hour's worth of songs that are all related

1131
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
In a common theme

1132
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
I think she doesn't have Friday

1133
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,560
But usually I'm cognizant of it by Sunday

1134
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
And I always look for it on Sunday

1135
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
It's always there sitting in my

1136
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,560
In my iTunes or if it's on the other computer my iPod or lemon

1137
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,560
And it's just a great Sunday kind of vibe

1138
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
And she really does a research on the songs

1139
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
You know fill up an hour on one theme

1140
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
You know and do that every single week

1141
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
So she's invited me at any time

1142
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Said you know I said geez

1143
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
I really love doing 80s

1144
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
You know

1145
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
80s music podcast

1146
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Just go through my iTunes basically and say here's another cool song

1147
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
I don't want to do it every week

1148
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
But I'd love doing it once or twice

1149
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,560
So the theory here is that if I

1150
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,560
If I make a podcast and give it to her

1151
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,560
They'll then be released under her license in the Netherlands

1152
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
And it'll be legal

1153
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,560
So I'm going to talk to I'm going to talk to some people about it

1154
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
But that would be just so freaking cool to do

1155
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
And that not that I would do it every week

1156
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
But I'd love doing

1157
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Probably get Patricia up that that might be the way to get Patricia back on the podcast

1158
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,560
It will talk about you know

1159
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Good times

1160
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Like do old farts exactly

1161
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Quickly now

1162
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Yeah

1163
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Thank you very much everyone who sent an information about

1164
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,560
EVDO the wireless broadband servers that is sweeping the nation

1165
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,560
Looks like I'm going to get hooked up

1166
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
I'll do it when I get back

1167
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,560
But then that really does save me all the hassle of getting the cable guys in here

1168
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
And I'll test it you know

1169
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
If it sucks then

1170
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
Then we'll know or if it doesn't

1171
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
I mean I'm not expecting all that

1172
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
I'm not expecting huge broadband speeds

1173
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
But if it gives me 500 kilobit to it to to

1174
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Mega bit download speed

1175
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
I'm good

1176
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
No one is told me about the upload speed though

1177
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,560
That is critical because when I'm shooting up

1178
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,560
You know source code and other files up to servers

1179
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
I do need some kind of throughput

1180
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,560
So at least at least 250 kilobits

1181
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
That's really not enough

1182
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
I mean 500 would be perfect

1183
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
But let's see what they got

1184
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
If anyone has that post that on the wiki as well

1185
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
On the wiki

1186
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Show notes

1187
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,560
And

1188
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
Oh yeah

1189
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
I am super husband

1190
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,560
I have hooked up Patricia and her sister Ivan

1191
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Next weekend

1192
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,560
Not this coming weekend

1193
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
Next weekend

1194
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,560
The two of them go to Paris

1195
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,560
They fly to Paris

1196
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,560
They run day boo in Paris

1197
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,560
And they're going to the fall fashion show

1198
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
I don't know if you know anything about fashion

1199
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
But it is really hard

1200
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
To get any kind of

1201
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
Entrance to these fashion shows

1202
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I mean

1203
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
You think that it's hard to get in like the MPV awards

1204
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
No no no no

1205
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Getting into the Chanel fall fashion line up

1206
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,560
No that's really really hard

1207
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
But I did it

1208
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
So I got him tickets

1209
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,560
And so that means that will definitely be a Saturday night special

1210
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Then because I'll be all alone

1211
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
Well I'll be with Christina

1212
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
But you know Christina

1213
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
She's she's always on her own computer

1214
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Doing all her own stuff

1215
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
She sent me a very cute email

1216
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
The other day

1217
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
I think she finally does miss me

1218
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
It's hard for 15 year old to miss her dad

1219
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
You know

1220
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,560
That's so much going on in her life

1221
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Her social agenda is so incredibly full

1222
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,560
I've rolled out some music from the pod safe music network

1223
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,560
As we near the end of today's daily source code

1224
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,560
This was amongst the top pod plays of the week

1225
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
I played it before on the show

1226
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
I just want to play it for you again

1227
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
46 blisters the name of the band

1228
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
This is in a long time

1229
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560
It's like fish you swim in

1230
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Took off your hat and turn your chin in

1231
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,560
Time still still and say

1232
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Mark's place

1233
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,560
We walked up with new hills

1234
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
At times like this

1235
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
And times like those

1236
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,560
We felt the heat of all the years

1237
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,560
I feel my head and spill

1238
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,560
My tears in love

1239
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,560
Time

1240
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,560
In a long time

1241
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,560
In a long time

1242
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,560
I feel the sea

1243
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,560
In a long time

1244
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,560
In a long time

1245
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,560
In a long time

1246
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,560
I don't see you

1247
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,560
I saw time round your feet once

1248
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1249
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Throwing on more cold hearts in it

1250
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,560
Don't walk and take your place

1251
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1252
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1253
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1254
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1255
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1256
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:05,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1257
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1258
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1259
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1260
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:43,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1261
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1262
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1263
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,560
Little seas that blink and shimmer

1264
00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:10,560
In a long time, In a long time, In a long time, In a long time, In a long time, I don't see you.

1265
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:18,560
I saw stars around the field, I saw the lights like wishes for me.

1266
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,560
To go to a higher turn, A chillin' time still still to say.

1267
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:31,560
The world's place we were dealing with, I always have time to say.

1268
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:38,560
This is the most time I've ever seen.

1269
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:47,560
I will see you.

1270
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:56,560
I will see you.

1271
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Not pretty.

1272
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,560
Like 46 Bliss.

1273
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:08,560

00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,560
And you get a band page, and you can put up all your links to, you know, selling your music,

1282
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:37,560
and your merchandise, and I think we're adding forums as well for the band pages,

1283
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,560
so that you can go in there and post comments about it.

1284
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,560
Podcasters as well.

1285
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Go in Register, which means anything you find on the Podsafe Music Network.

1286
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,560
You can download, using your podcast.

1287
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,560
As long as you report it back to the network, then it's all cool.

1288
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,560
It's a very, very simple agreement.

1289
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,560
Right, I got to get out of here.

1290
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,560
So tomorrow, as I said, I'm flying back straight from SFO to Heathrow.

1291
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,560
What was that like, 12 and a half, 13 hours?

1292
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:09,560
So I'll have plenty of time to catch up on some podcast listening as well, working on some other stuff.

1293
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,560
And that means that the show tomorrow show will be up, you know, really early.

1294
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,560
I'll probably have, I'm going to, maybe I might even, I might even get a really, really early to do it.

1295
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
We'll do it.

1296
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,560
We'll do it.

1297
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Why the frick am I up this early podcast?

1298
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,560
And then I'm definitely going to chill over the weekend, hang out with the girls and Monday.

1299
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,560
Of course, we'll be back with the, with the normal source code.

1300
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,560
So that's it.

1301
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,560
This was the first podcast that will simultaneously cast same day broadcast via satellite.

1302
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,560
We're in space, baby.

1303
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:44,560
And as well as on the, on the regular podcast feed daily source code.com is where you can find the feed to subscribe to the show.

1304
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,560

1305
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,560
That's a free download for Apple.

1306
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,560
And we know as users from Mac and Windows users.

1307
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:57,560
And of course, I bought a lemon, which lots of people really, really love and are very, very loyal to.

1308
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,560
