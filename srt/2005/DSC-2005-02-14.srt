00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Daily Source Code, Monday, February 14th, 2005, transmitters, we don't need no stinking transmittance.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Happy Valentine's, everybody. It's the 14th of February.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And welcome once again to the Daily Source Code.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Start of a brand new week, a big week for me, because I'm going to be traveling all over the globe.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right. Starting off with the Netherlands, leaving in just a couple hours.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's 1-21 in the afternoon. This is the source code coming to you from Curry Cottage.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Once again, I've got my perfectly brewed cup of Senseo coffee right here.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When we talk about that later on, I've been trying to sell these Senseo coffee machines now that I haven't Amazon-associated.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And guess what? I'll tell you all about the sales later on.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In the show, we've got lots of stuff, news on some iPod or clients.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We've got some pod-safe music, some pod-safe music cromos.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We've got all kinds of interesting cromos.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Of course, young pull-ups hit test and a mashup or two, because y'all love them so much.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, I apologize if you're waiting for something over the weekend.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There's some form of extended ketchup podcast, which I didn't get around to doing.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Actually, I was waiting on Skype to see if Ken Clark would come online.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And he didn't, well, there was lots of TV to watch over the weekend.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We had the Brit Awards, that was Friday. I got home, I just missed it.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Luckily, my Skype digital box, of course, records almost everything you're watching.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
See, then there was the BAFTA Awards on Saturday night.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
BAFTAs are the British Academy, I wasn't British Academy film awards.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And it was pretty boring, really.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It was just like a fucking awards.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, I don't know, no glitz, no glamour.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Nothing compared to the Brits Awards, which I guess is the British version of the Grammys.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It was really, and the BAFTAs, it was interesting.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There was lots of American movie stars that showed up.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I think all of them were really surprised.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
None of them expected the Red Carpet to be very much the Pandemonium that you would see in Hollywood.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She gives me a lot of sense.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was kind of fun to see the American actors and how different they respond to the press overseas,

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and just how different they respond to the fans.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know, it was, well, maybe just wasn't as Hollywood as you'd expected to be.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So it was kind of fun to watch that.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So it was plenty of TV.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Otherwise, you know, TV boars me to fucking tears.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You know, flip, flip, flopping back and forth between the internet.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry, the internet.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And TV news, Dresden was in the news.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
German town that housed a very important communication center for the Nazis.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And you're the end of the second world war, as well as an important train communication.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sorry, connection.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And only a couple of months before the war ended, the Allied forces bombed Dresden to shit,

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
killing what the record says is 30 to 35,000 people.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And so, you know, that's always, every year there's a remembrance there in Dresden,

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
not just of Dresden and the people that Paris there,

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
just about ending violence in the war in general.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And it's funny because I was watching the press reports on sky news, ITV news.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think you even see it as CNN.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And it was, you know, the re-flaying and all that.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But online I was reading about 5,000 protesters who were,

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think most of them were fascist, right wing neo-Nazis.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But I don't know, because I never saw any pictures.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So it goes to show, you know, what's happening?

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What was really happening?

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There were no pictures on weblogs either.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So just kind of interesting to see this disconnect in the news there.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So we got a brand new week, a lot going on.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Wednesday I'm going to New York.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Wednesday is a very important day.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
February 16th, the Bitties cast kicks off in Nueva York.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So I'm going to be there for the big show.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can't wait to meet all the girls in person.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And, oh man, we're going to be talking every single night about what's going on,

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
because there's lots of exciting stuff happening.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Lots of opportunities, lots of podcasts, stuff to be done.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And it's all happening this week.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Although today I leave for the Netherlands,

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
there's a narrow casting conference tomorrow.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Graham has to view the company that I'm a shareholder in.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Flat screen company is one of the founding partners of this conference.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Is anything but a blogger con, right?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's like the reverse of a blogger con where everyone who is a founder,

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
or paid to get the conference together,

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
gets to do their little commercial on stage.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I'll be doing part of it for Graham has to view.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But also, I will be talking about podcasting.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And I'm really looking forward to it.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been working hard with the good friends of mine on a video presentation

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
of podcasting, which is always fun to present.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Podcasting, which is predominantly audio, right?

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In a video context.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So it should be fun.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And today on the show to celebrate the continuing jury selection

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
of my cool Jackson and his trial.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And remember, I'm supporting Michael Jackson.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know what the fuck the evidence is.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There may be 40,000 pages of testimony,

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
but I still have a real hard time believing all the allegations.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Clearly, Michael Jackson is under some severe pressure.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It needs a little bit of help there.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Just a little bit of support, you know?

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The face known to millions is a superstar pop singer.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Now, we've also used as a mugshot at the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department.

95

So he can run, run, run, run

144

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,860
We don't tell each other, you know

154
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,860
Why don't you worry?

155
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,860
And I'll tell each other, you two care for

156
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,860
But if you belong to me, and you're the night

157
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,860
And I'll tell each other, to tell each other

158
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:52,860
Everything about ourselves, this is from us dance

159
00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:00,860
This is our last dance, this is our song

160
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
I'm going on like this

161
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Ooh, baby

162
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,860
This music career is on hold, this next record

163
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
I want to record the record

164
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,860
To be a criminal

165
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,860
Wow

166
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,860
Most excellent mashup really really enjoyed that one

167
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,860
Clearly it came from the UK

168
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,860
And a lot of people asked me to post these mashups online

169
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Of course, I can't do that as you know, because

170
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
I mean, probably playing them as even

171
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,860
Very iffy when it comes to RIA and Ask Cap

172
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
And BMI

173
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,860
Of course, these types of records would probably never see the light of day

174
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
And in an official release because

175
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Oh, it's just so much hassle to go through

176
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,860
To get all the rights to release them together

177
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
And, you know, it's a pain, so it's good that we can enjoy them

178
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
But I can't post them online

179
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Although I do hope in the future

180
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,860
And we'll be able to do this with the OPML and show notes

181
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,860
And we'll have some type of system

182
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Which have been thinking about quite a lot

183
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
And actually Drew's been working on it as well

184
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,860
From Dawn and Drew

185
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,860
To come up with the way where

186
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Once it's in my show notes

187
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,860
Then you can also retrieve it automatically

188
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,860
If you want to grab it

189
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,860
So really just trying to cut out steps on the

190
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,860
Production side and also on the

191
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,860
You know, on the receiving side

192
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,860
So that if you like something that you hear in a show

193
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,860
That you should be able to, you know, get it

194
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Fairly simply

195
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,860
Oh, man, excuse me, this sincerely

196
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Or it's just really hit me today

197
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,860
Speaking of RIA

198
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
He's an email

199
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Matthew, he says Adam thought you're going to kick out of this email

200
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm

201
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,860
The guy from Muse

202
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,860
That's been harassing Bob Lefsits to get into podcast

203
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,860
And now Lefsits writes a very very influential newsletter

204
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,860
To all the top RIA industry types

205
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
So he

206
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,860
There's apparently this mailing list

207
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,860
That the RIA folks are all on

208
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
And I just wanted to read this

209
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
This too because it's it's pretty interesting

210
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,860
If this was the RIA

211
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
RIA folks

212
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,860
Are reading

213
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Oh, man

214
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
How inconvenient to receive a phone call

215
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,860
This moment

216
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,860
Okay, let's switch that off

217
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
Okay

218
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Let's see

219
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Here we go, I'm hooked

220
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,860
I might have to download the software to pull all 70 shows on my iPod

221
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,860
But Dawn and Drew are just that riveting

222
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
Did you ever know anybody in love?

223
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
God, are you reading blank?

224
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,860
Freaks me right out

225
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,860
The part where they talk about where their marriage is going to last

226
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
The key element is

227
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Contempt

228
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Oh, it's very hard to read the signals

229
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,860
Oh, second

230
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,860
I just lost my place

231
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,860
Here we go

232
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
You've got to be a pro

233
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,860
But once you're glued in

234
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,860
You know that slight role of the eyeball

235
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,860
The slight brow lift that evidence

236
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Evidence is contempt and the marriage is doomed

237
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,860
My marriage was doomed by contempt

238
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,860
My x-y was just too untogether

239
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
We'd get frustrated

240
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
Couldn't you please lock the door when you leave the house

241
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
I've got tens of thousands of dollars worth of shit in here

242
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
But as many times I mentioned

243
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
She always continued to leave the door unlocked

244
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
So then it goes in this whole thing about

245
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Respect about marriage

246
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,860
And then finally we get to the meat of all this

247
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,860
It appears Dawn and Drew are in love

248
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
Or maybe it's just that I'm infatuated with Dawn

249
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,860
Maybe she really wears the pants

250
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Maybe Drew is kind of passes

251
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,860
But Dawn is a dream, first and foremost

252
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,860
She's verbal

253
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
I hate the silent babes

254
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
Well silence drives me nuts

255
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,860
I want to be with someone who's got something to say

256
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,860
And I don't feel like an idiot when I come into

257
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,860
On the minutiae of my life

258
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,860
When I spin my theories, make my observations

259
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,860
Dawn can keep up her end of the conversation

260
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,860
But she's not the tactics

261
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,860
She's not overbearing she's kind of like

262
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
You know the kind of girlfriend you can't stop

263
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,860
Bumping into on the couch

264
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
They say stuff to bug you

265
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
The tiniest little bit to get under your skin

266
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
Just a little because you know that's why they're doing it

267
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,860
I want to slide your hip over and bumpers

268
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,860
An evidence of intimacy

269
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,860
As evidence of connection

270
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,860
You got to read this whole thing

271
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,860
I'm not going to go through all of it

272
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,860
But if this is indeed what they're reading about podcasting

273
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,860
They'll be all over it

274
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,860
And there's a lot of love

275
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
Dawn in this one

276
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,860
I just got to kick out the fact that the R-I-A-A is reading all these wonderful words

277
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,860
About the love between Dawn and Drew

278
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860
Hey Adam

279
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Hey Adam

280
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,860
I thought it was Daily Source Corio

281
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,860
Dude

282
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,860
But I also know a lot of podcasts you ought to listen to

283
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,860
It's called the B-K-L-A podcast

284
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
So we're at B-K-L-A

285
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,860
That likes bad that can

286
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm telling you right now

287
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,860
Listen to this show

288
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Or hit you so high I'll kill your old family

289
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Don't say it

290
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,860
I'll listen to it

291
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,860
If you notice

292
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
W-W-W dot curry dot com

293
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,860
There's now a Senseo coffee machine on the right hand side

294
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
I got a lot of email from people

295
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
After I was talking about wouldn't be great

296
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
If you had some easy way to set up a store

297
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,860
So when you talk about stuff on your podcast

298
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
People actually go and purchase that

299
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,860
And a number of people have purchased a number of different items

300
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,860
And if told me about it after listening to the source code

301
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,860
iPods, I-Rivers

302
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
Breakout boxes

303
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,860
Music

304
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,860
And Senseo machines

305
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,860
I granted not many

306
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
But I've certainly sold two or three

307
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,860
You know I got all these pointers

308
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,860
You know to Amazon the associate program with Amazon

309
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,860
And well it works

310
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,860
I signed up

311
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,860
You know got the code put it right there on my web log

312
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,860
So if you're hearing me slurping down this wonderful Senseo coffee

313
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,860
And wondering wow

314
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,860
Wouldn't be great if for like 50 or 60 bucks I could buy one of those for myself

315
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,860
Well now you can and so far I've sold

316
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Zero Senseo's

317
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,860
I don't think even

318
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,860
Clicked on the link yet

319
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
Some more news in the show notes

320
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Which of course a company the source code every single episode

321
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,860
There's also a way to make your own coffee pods

322
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,860
There are third party pod sites for different flavored coffee

323
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
For tea pods

324
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,860
And even to put other stuff in

325
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,860
In case you didn't just want to have coffee in there

326
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,860
Again all of that in the show notes

327
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,860
And if you're thinking of buying a Senseo

328
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
Let's see if we can prove the model

329
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,860
Let's see if you can click on the logo on my site

330
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
And actually purchase it through Amazon

331
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,860
Wouldn't that be grand

332
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,860
Daddy

333
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,860
This got real

334
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Hey Adam this is David from the debate guide podcast

335
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,860
I've got a piece of trivia for you

336
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,860
Back in the 1930s both

337
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Sigmund Freud and atheist

338
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,860
And CS Lewis a Christian

339
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,860
Resided in the London area

340
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
But most people don't know

341
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,860
Is that they used to get together

342
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
To drink beer and debate about the existence of God

343
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,860
They secretly met at a place down in Gilford

344
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,860
Which is known today as curry cottage

345
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,860
Here's a little advice

346
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
Neither of them like cheap trick

347
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Oh

348
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Oh

349
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,860
Oh

350
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,860
Oh

351
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,860
That's the cheap trick

352
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,860
I'll be falling off my wall

353
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,860
So Adam

354
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,860
You might think about storing your precious platinum album in a safe place

355
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
Anyway check out my podcast

356
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
That's debate god dot com

357
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,860
Debate god dot com

358
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,860
Okay

359
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,860
You know I got a lot of promo sent to me

360
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,860
MP3 feedback a gmail dot com

361
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,860
If you're wondering how I make the choices

362
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,860
Well, you know it's the creativity

363
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,860
And there are people that send in four or five minute promos

364
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
You know this like no way

365
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I'm ever going to be able to get that on the air

366
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,860
No time to cut it down the size either

367
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,860
So the shorter the better

368
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,860
I do love promoting as many podcasts as possible

369
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
Because you know

370
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Well, we got to promote them somewhere

371
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,860
And I let all the cross-pollumization actually is great

372
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,860
I was on the skinny on sports this weekend

373
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
On there you know the the fastest ten minutes on your iPod

374
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
That was great to be interviewed by the guys

375
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,860
They talked to me about

376
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,860
Stairroids and other forms of doping and about you know

377
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,860
What sports I used to play

378
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,860
I

379
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
You know even you should listen to the interview

380
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
The skinny on sports dot com

381
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,860
TSOS

382
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
You can find in the iPod dot org directory under the sports

383
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
No, of course

384
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
I'll tell you though that I did actually play a sport

385
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
When I was

386
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,860
Or participate in a sport

387
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
And a sport I should say when I was oh man

388
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
I'm thinking I was probably 1514

389
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
1314 at the time

390
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,860
And I was pretty damn good at it

391
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
The sport

392
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,860
Fencing

393
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Adam this is Kevin C. Total KCT's digital world

394
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,860
And we got a serious problem

395
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,860
While I really appreciate the problem

396
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,860
When you play for my commute cast on your February first daily source code

397
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
I've taken a look at my feed burner stats

398
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
And there are people downloading this podcast

399
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
On iPod or SP

400
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
Yep, you know what that means

401
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
We've got folks that are listening to the commute cast

402
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
While driving on their smartphones

403
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
We can't have that

404
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,860
I don't know about you

405
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
But I certainly don't want to be

406
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
One of these folks wrapped themselves around a tree

407
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
While listening to the commute cast

408
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
So whatever you do

409
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
Please don't mention KCT

410
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,860
They do a world dot com

411
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
Or the commute cast ever again

412
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,860
In fact

413
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Please tell me we're not to go to KCT's digital world dot com

414
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,860
Every Friday because that's why I upload the commute cast

415
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
We don't want that Adam

416
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Can you help me out

417
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Thanks

418
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Yep, yep

419
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Mum's the word dude

420
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
I totally promise

421
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
That is cool though

422
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
That I've seen a couple of those as well

423
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Podcasts SP

424
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,860
So the handhelds are out there

425
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,860
And what's this is Microsoft coming out with the new phone that I saw

426
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,860
The call it was some I don't like the name P buddy

427
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,860
Why though is have these weird code names for everything

428
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
The P buddy phone

429
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,860
Of course it only conjures up images of cartoon characters

430
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
It doesn't really

431
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,860
And why P buddy he's a cartoon character right?

432
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Yeah, I guess so

433
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,860
It's like okay

434
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
But I could get pretty exciting

435
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,860
I'm seeing more and more mobile

436
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,860
Mobile devices picking up the podcast

437
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,860
And more and more iPodders for mobile devices

438
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
Which is very cool

439
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,860
You can find those all at iPod.org by the way

440
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
Just look for the link on the left hand side

441
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,860
That's his download iPod

442
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,860
And people who are looking to get started in podcasting

443
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Either receiving or transmitting

444
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,860
We have a documentation place

445
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
It's iPod.org slash docs

446
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
It's pretty much where I send everybody to

447
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,860
When they ask me how they get started

448
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,860
So iPod.org slash DOCS

449
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,860
And while we're on the topic of iPodders

450
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,860
To we're talking about Doppler

451
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,860
First of all the developers of Doppler

452
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Doppler radio dot net

453
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,860
Two Dutch developers Cindy and Irwin

454
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,860
I was questioning their relationship on the show last Friday

455
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Guess what they are a couple

456
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,860
They were even a couple before I mentioned it

457
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,860
So that's nice and I put a link to their little couple

458
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Shot there of them scuba diving

459
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,860
And we've still had some problems with

460
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,860
Well not necessarily with Doppler radio

461
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,860
But with dot mac hosting

462
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,860
So if you're placing your MP3s

463
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,860
For your podcast on the dot mac infrastructure

464
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,860
Basically you're putting them on your eyed disk

465
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
We're still having problems

466
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,860
In fact let me just do the

467
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,860
I do a daily check a couple times a day

468
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,860
To see if they figured out they're caching

469
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,860
They're using these net cache

470
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Boxes that essentially I guess kind of

471
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,860
What what they do they distribute the load

472
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,860
The problem is is hill and here it is

473
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Let me just see if we're

474
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,860
Now still getting a invalid method

475
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,860
The problem is that they have

476
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,860
That probably about 20 of these boxes on their network

477
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,860
And most of them are I'm just going to call it

478
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,860
Misconfigured because they're not allowing a head request

479
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,860
Whenever you ask for head you want to get it immediately

480
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,860
The head request

481
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,860
Essentially feeds back a number of things

482
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,860
One of them is the size of the file that is about to be downloaded

483
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
And Doppler radio is actually very smart

484
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,860
Because it's asking for this size

485
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,860
So that it will know if it's downloaded the entire file

486
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Which helps a lot with the resume will download

487
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
So if you break somewhere

488
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
If you're computer crashes or if you quit the program

489
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
The next time you turn it on it will say

490
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
Download it x amount of this file

491
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
It's this big so let me resume the download

492
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
So that is not working even worse

493
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Since it can't get the size and this is maybe

494
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,860
I'm going to hate fucking hacking around this stuff

495
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,860
But you know that's one thing that we could do is we could say

496
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,860
Well if you can't get the size just download

497
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
No matter what that's one way around it

498
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,860
But essentially

499
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Dot max stuff is kind of breaking the way the internet works

500
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,860
I mean these are protocols that are tried and tried and

501
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,860
True and relied upon by lots of applications

502
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Not just podcasting

503
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
And in my particular case

504
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,860
Since I can't get used the head statement

505
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,860
I can't even attach it automatically

506
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,860
To my RSS feeds with the software I'm using

507
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,860
So it's definitely messing up a whole bunch of stuff

508
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,860
There are people aware at netcash

509
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
They know about it

510
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,860
But somewhere we're just not connecting

511
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,860
And so if you know anybody who has anything to do with dot mac

512
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,860
Or with their netcash

513
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,860
It is let them know on curie dot com

514
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Of posted lots of information

515
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,860
It's basically one little option that has to be turned on

516
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,860
To turn off and maybe this is by choice

517
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,860
You know that's cool too but just let us know

518
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,860
So we're not waiting around because I'm already ordering

519
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,860
Ben with from somewhere else and lots of other people

520
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,860
Will be as well and it's just kind of a shame

521
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,860
Because it works so nicely with the mac and tosh

522
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,860
And I tested nimic

523
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,860
Another fact man there's a lot of Dutch iPotter development

524
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,860
I tested nimic and iM iQ

525
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,860
You can find that in the iPotter.org software directory as well

526
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,860
It's for windows only

527
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Did that downstairs on that Christina's windows box under my own account

528
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Of course

529
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,860
And I noticed something interesting there

530
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,860
It has an opml browser built right in

531
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Which is although very cool

532
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,860
It doesn't follow the links

533
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,860
And if you look at the opml file

534
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
For the iPotter.org directory

535
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
40 to 50% of it

536
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,860
Is links to other opml files that are being handled by other people

537
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
It's a distributed directory

538
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
And it doesn't follow those

539
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,860
So even worse the links don't show up

540
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
So maybe the nimic guys could take it

541
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
I think it's ed by the way

542
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
I think ed does nimic

543
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
So we could take a look and see if we could figure out how to

544
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Be able to follow the opml links

545
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
And we'll actually have the whole directory in there

546
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Because what's happening now is

547
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
As more people are maintaining

548
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,860
Nodes of the directory

549
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,860
What you're seeing in nimic is getting smaller

550
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,860
And smaller looks like there's nothing left over

551
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Because today and I just posted a announcement about that

552
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,860
We passed the 3000 podcast mark on iPotter.org

553
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,860
357 podcasts

554
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
In less than a year

555
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,860
What in less than nine months

556
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,860
Congratulations y'all

557
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
Hey Adam

558
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,860
This is Rina Marie from the band tracks podcast

559
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,860
Where we focus on independent pod safe music

560
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,860
And help artists sell their stuff in our online store at

561
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,860
Bantracks.net

562
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Just wanted to thank you for playing the pod safe music

563
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,860
Trivia on last Thursday's show

564
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,860
And yes, I did know all the answers

565
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Because I listened to the accident

566
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Hasht pod cast every time it comes out

567
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,860
That's because accident hash and band tracks

568
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,860
Are part of the association of music podcasting

569
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
Or amp

570
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,860
Which we joined along with five other shows

571
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Including in somnior radio

572
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
In over your head

573
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
Indy feed

574
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,860
And the 250 million dollar radio show

575
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
We thought it would be a great way to pool our resources

576
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,860
And get the word out for the thousands of great bands

577
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,860
You've probably never heard

578
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,860
Anyway, the trivia was a bit tough for you

579
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,860
And you asked for the songs to play

580
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
Instead of having to guess them

581
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,860
So here's a great unsigned artist out of New York City

582
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,860
Named Andrew Vladik with you can't kill time

583
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,860
courtesy of the band tracks podcast

584
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,860
We were going down living in old canoe

585
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,860
And when we had the rocks broken to you

586
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,860
Pull me out as I was tossed by

587
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,860
Lay my clothes on the banks to dry

588
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,860
But before I could thank you

589
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,860
I fell in again over the falls

590
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,860
And over hand woke up

591
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,860
And I pulled my own sweat

592
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Another dream about regret

593
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,860
I did not foresee

594
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,860
You can't kill time

595
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,860
And feel

596
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,860
And sanity

597
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Time to live

598
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Only

599
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Your vanity

600
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,860
We were driving through the desert

601
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,860
When the whole world the engines was melting

602
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
When we were two

603
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,860
All I could find was a dried oak creek

604
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,860
But you found a water bottle under the back scene

605
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,860
But before I could thank you

606
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
I liked it out of your hands

607
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,860
You watched it spilled out into the sand

608
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
Another rise bounced from view

609
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Another dream about regret

610
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,860
I did not foresee

611
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,860
You can't kill time

612
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,860
And feel

613
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,860
And sanity

614
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,860
No, no

615
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Time to live

616
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,860
Only

617
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,860
Your vanity

618
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,860
No

619
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,860
No

620
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,860
No

621
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,860
No

622
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,860
You're talking so to that

623
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,860
I'm north bare at somewhere inside

624
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,860
I try to uncover but I made a mouse

625
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,860
You listen to a crazy man, guess

626
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:37,860
Because I never could understand my gut

627
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Wish I could have my trap shut

628
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,860
So many things I never did mention

629
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,860
Only have the best intentions

630
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,860
I did not foresee

631
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,860
Because you can't kill time

632
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,860
And feel

633
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,860

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,860
No

639
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
No

640
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Thanks again Adam

00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,860

Wow, the association of music podcasts

646
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,860
I've seen that around

647
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,860
I think I read it on the podcast

648
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,860
I've seen it on the podcast

649
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,860
I've seen it on the podcast

650
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,860
I've seen it on the podcast

00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
I've seen it on the podcast

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,860
I've seen it on the podcast

653
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
I've seen it on the podcast

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,860
I've seen it on the podcast

I've seen it on the podcast

657
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,860
I've seen it on the podcast

658
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
I've seen it on the podcast

659
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,860
I've seen it on the podcast

660
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,860
I've seen it on the podcast

661
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,860
I've seen it on the podcast

662
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
I've seen it on the podcast

663
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,860
And I remember, I got to remember

664
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,860
I got to play some birdies this week

665
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Together we're almost at the end of today Show

666
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
We've got to play some birdies

667
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,420
Getting ready for the big bitty cast

668
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,860
They've been recording all kinds of stuff

669
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,860
I'm really curious to see what they come up with

670
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,860
And then you know Leon is been in touch with me all over the past few weeks

671
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,860
And I said, actually. Sir, don't say

672
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,860
You guys are away

673
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,860
Let me see, still come

674
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,860
The head test

675
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,260
That's right, Moorth grows on you, and it's really growing this month with great savings

684
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,300
Yeah, that's a kind of weird podcast.

685
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Just listen to that.

686
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,100
It's production values are pretty good as you could tell from the promo.

687
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
It's pretty wacky.

688
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,100
I was turned on to it by Caleb from Florida, I think, Caleb, by the way, has an interesting

689
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
podcast.

690
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,560
He has the ex-drunk-alog, ex-drunk-alog.

691
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:03,000
He's a fabulous painter, and just has a lot of stories about being a former drunk.

692
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,480
Next week on the Creepy Sleepy Show, an interview with quite possibly the most controversial

693
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,880
figure in the last 7,000 years.

694
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,840
That's right, next week on the Creepy Sleepy Show, we have an interview with the Almighty

695
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Herself.

696
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,600
We're going to be asking, the important point in question, such as, does the religious

697
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,760
write really represent him on earth?

698
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,560
It's George Stubby, a really predestined to be president.

699
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,640
Why did it send that crappy band creed to earth to do its work?

700
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,640
If marijuana is so horrible, why did you plant it everywhere?

701
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,280
Why are the secret 11 herbs and spices in Kentucky fried chicken?

702
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,760
Seriously, who's right?

703
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,760
These rallies were the Palestinians.

704
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,720
And most importantly, will old dirty bastards spend eternity in heaven?

705
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,360
These questions and more.

706
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,600
Next week on the Creepy Sleepy interview with...

707
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:58,880
Sunday night, Sunday night, Sunday night, Sunday night, Sunday night, that's when I got

708
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
a tune in.

709
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
I do.

710
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
It's podcasting.

711
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,600
I get to choose my own time that I listen to God.

712
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,960
Oh man, this is turning out to be a silly show.

713
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,920
So I kind of agreed with a lot of people who sent in email about trivia Thursday that

714
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,200
it was complete overkill.

715
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,240
Although, lots of people like different bits, it was like, okay, you know, no, let's not

716
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
do that.

717
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,480
Malcolm, Malcolm Owen sent me this email says, so trivia Thursday is now starting to

718
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,720
strain at the seams.

719
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,320
This means only one thing.

720
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,720
It's completely unpredictable.

721
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Now, I'm a star.

722
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:38,160
For instance, karaoke Tuesday, mash up Friday, ski Sunday, knitting Wednesday, to

723
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,520
we Maguire Monday, Hustler Magazine Saturday, sponsored by Penthouse, and make Adam

724
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,360
eat bagels whilst doing the cha cha with a blow up doll Thursday.

725
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Yes.

726
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,200
Oh, great ideas.

727
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
That kind of agreed.

728
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
That's our old school.

729
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,480
That's so, uh, so broadcast, you know, to have those kind of days.

730
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
I'm sorry.

731
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,280
Once the while I slip into old habits, which dive very, very hard, and of course, there's

732
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,920
new habits, which you just don't want to have die.

733
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:11,800
Oh, I'm casting with Adam Curry, my mama always said, the hit test was like a box

734
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
or chocolate.

735
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,920
You never know what you're going to get.

736
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,840
But I'm for Adam Curry to take the opportunity with y'all, hold it.

737
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Hey, Adam.

738
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Hey, buddy.

739
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,080
Here's the thin edition of the hit test.

740
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,360
Wait, it's a lustrum.

741
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,080
We must celebrate.

742
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,960
And if you're ready, we're going to start right away.

743
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
So here we go.

744
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
This is number one.

745
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
All right.

746
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:45,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's magic.

747
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
There you go.

748
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Pilot.

749
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,800
And this is number two.

750
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Oh, well.

751
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Yeah.

752
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:03,640
But this would be Patricia, when she was with a pet shop boys.

753
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,000
And number three.

754
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,200
Man, young, I can't wait to hear the answers.

755
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:18,880
Of course, it's Tony Katayn's ex-boyfriend David Copperdog with white snow.

756
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
And these are the answers.

757
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Good luck, John.

758
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Like it.

759
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,320
And so number one in today's hit test.

760
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
This is violence.

761
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Yeah, magic.

762
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,720
Oh, oh, it's magic.

763
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,720
Big one hit wonder band from the 70s.

764
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:43,800
Played that one in ladies on one.

765
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,840
And the second answer, the pet shop boy, this is West End Girls.

766
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:56,320
Hey, two for two.

767
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:11,120
And the third and final answer, white snake.

768
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Here I go again.

769
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,280
And we're going Tony Katayn was crawling all over the jar.

770
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,040
Boom!

771
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:28,440
Any round of music.

772
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,880
So walk, oh!

773
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:40,040
Weird, and yeah all on my own.

774
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:47,240
To conclude, the tenth edition of the hit test, feedback is welcome at hittest at gmail.com

775
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:55,040
and you can find them all through download at www.helpetense.nl slash hit test.

776
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,040
While I done that's it for today, see you next time for the next edition of the hit test.

777
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Bye-bye.

778
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Thank you very much.

779
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
I appreciate all the work as always.

780
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Maybe we should do a little bit differently next time.

781
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,040
What if we did shorter clues?

782
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
But repeat the clue a couple times.

783
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,040
So maybe it's just a little snippet of the intro.

784
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Because now it's like, I'm actually, I can hum along and sing along until I get it.

785
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Just to make it harder for me and maybe even more fun for the audience interaction is play a snippet.

786
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
Play three times, maybe in a row.

787
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,040
So I could stop it and think about it and think about it with the audience.

788
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,040
And then obviously we'll go with the answers the same way you've done it.

789
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
But I love these hit tests, y'all.

790
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,040
Thank you very much.

791
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Once again, hit test number 10 on your daily source code.

792
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Wow.

793
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
That's almost 40 minutes for you.

794
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,040
I've got to pack my bags, get all my stuff together.

795
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,040
It's just a short overnight, but it still requires hair products.

796
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,040
By the way, not a lot of comments about the hair and the USA today picture.

797
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,040
I guess it wasn't all that bad.

798
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Actually, I thought it was pretty hot, so.

799
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
Hey, comments.

800
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Adam and Craig are comments.

I'm off on easy jet.

808
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Remember, not just a passenger.

809
