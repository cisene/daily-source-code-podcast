1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
radio content in my ears, I like to think I'm flying into the future.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
From home, don't share a Charlie 3-0-3

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Was it hard?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Was it hard to find?

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That the notes, that the notes, a your mind, did you take control

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
With the eyes that you broke, wasn't so hard, good to lose

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
As a deal, wearing shining new shoes, you said

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Was it so hard?

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Was it hard?

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Did you break it to?

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Was it hard?

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Was it hard?

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Was it hard to you?

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Did you want?

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Right to, keep your steps, follow it through

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Was it so hard?

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Good to lose

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
As a deal, wearing all the new shoes, you said

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Was it so hard?

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Was it so hard?

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Was it so hard?

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Was it so hard?

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Was it so hard?

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Was it so hard?

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not afraid of the clothes you wear.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not afraid to join in your mode.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I got the feeling that you won't come around, baby.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I got the feeling that you won't.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Was it so hard?

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Was it so hard?

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Was it so hard?

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Was it so hard?

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Was it so hard?

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Was it so hard?

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Selected for your listening enjoyment.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
By the daily source code, HotSafe is a network personal shoppers.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's leave the echo delta, drop the A for extra assumption.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Was it hard to title that?

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Like that very much.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is exactly the way it should be working.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
People sending me suggestions for songs to play off of the Podsake Music Network.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Exactly the way.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Remember, I'm going to write a little letter.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to send it to my local DJ.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's what we need listeners.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We need your help.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's from the Podsake Music Network.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How are you doing?

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's Thursday coming to you from the cottage.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It may be Friday or the weekend, wherever you are.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't do a show yesterday.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I was visiting my mom.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Talk a little bit about that.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll see some promos, of course.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Some classic audio on the way from Al Johnson.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're going to talk a bit about, well, we'll talk about our Metro Sexual Stuff.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm about shaving a couple more Podsafe tunes, including a Christmas tune on the way.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm having a Trinity and biodiesel talk for tomorrow's show, I guess, along with some blank

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
media stuff that I've been collecting.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've been using Omni Outliner on the Mac.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it's an outlining program.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's really convenient for putting my shows together.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because, you know, my show basically starts at the top and ends at the bottom of the list.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And as I go along, sometimes find myself changing stuff, moving stuff around.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It kind of corresponds with what I'm doing in Megasag, although there's a lot of manual

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
intervention there, keeping both lists synchronized.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, man.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Wouldn't it be nice if Megasag could import my Omni Outliner file?

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, my goodness.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That would be fucking awesome.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Anyway, it's cool because you can basically drag and drop MP3s into it.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Bookmarks for URLs, all this stuff, and it just becomes my console, if you will.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you hear that?

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I got a, that's the radiator now.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, at first I thought it was Roger Smalls going through my trash again.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But no, it turns out the radiator at this point has so much air in it that it sounds

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
like someone's dragging a milk cart in the cross, the pavement out in front of the cottage.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A lot of racking.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I got to find the key to let the air out.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So yesterday, whoa, big, big, big, big day.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Went to see my mom, who, first of all, thank you all so much for all the wonderful emails

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that you've sent me emails of support, encouragement of hope of prayer.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's really, really appreciated.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I mean, I, I've tried to respond, I started this morning, started to respond to,

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to just about everyone who sent something in, there's so much.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry if I missed yours, but I really appreciated this.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, we'll get to the whole cancer thing in a moment.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let me take the day step by step because it was quite a, quite a rollercoaster ride,

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
actually.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
First of all, the wind commander stayed overnight, so we had an early start.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, when you have two women in the house, an early start is basically leaving within 30 minutes of your estimated time with the part show.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're doing pretty good.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We drove off to the, to Farrow, to the airport.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We were there around, I wanted to be there around 830.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We're there on 9 o'clock.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I got everything.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We were already pre-fueled.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Everything was ready to go.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I just went up the tower to make sure we had everything all set.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And our flight plan was filed.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Also just to say hi, you know, it's a small local airfield to kind of drop in and be social for a couple of minutes.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then we took off.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It wasn't a, it wasn't a brilliant day, but flying at what we do.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We were around 3,000 feet was nice between broken clouds above us around four and a half thousand feet and a cloud cover below us.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Now, I don't have an instrument rating.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I am training from an instrument rating.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So we do a lot of work in, in the plane on these types of flights, the wind commander and I.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And he gives me all kinds of stuff to do.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And now we're not flying on a visual GPS, you know, with a nice screen or anything.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
None of that stuff is, I do have a GPS, but it's a very, very basic system.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Just basically with a text read out.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But most of the training that you do for instruments is, well, guess what, flying on instruments, which includes tuning in,

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
VORs.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So you can basically vector where you are and being able to hold altitude and, and your direction while essentially being in complete cloud cover, which is a very weird sensation.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I mean, that's really, we've talked about this before.

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They call it kind of the leans.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, you'll be flying.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And if you look outside and, of course, you see nothing but white around you.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You know that you're moving, but you can't see anything.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It becomes like a, a really interesting Disney type park ride.

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And you'll think, well, wait a minute, the plane is going right and I should be, you know, and you, your body almost starts leaning left or vice versa.

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And you want to turn and then you look at your instruments and you see that the attitude of the airplane is doing something completely different than what you thought it was doing.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now, we have an autopilot in the machine, but when you're doing these exercises, really, you know, doing it all by hand is what it's about.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, mostly it was all clear smooth sailing until we got up to Rotterdam where the, the cover was at like 600 feet.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So it was a complete IFR approach instrument flying rules, which I did by hand.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And at the same time, it had kind of a panic-stricken passenger in the back, Christina started to freak out because,

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
well, both the girls had elected not to wear headsets.

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I think that when you're not hearing what's going on and you're not seeing anything because you look out, you know,

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and it's like, you know, think about me having the, the leans, how about the passengers who aren't used to it.

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Because you can, not only can you see out the, the left and the right hand side, you can look out in front,

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that's something you can't do on a jetliner.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So it's very confusing, Christina was definitely, you know, uneasy, which made me, of course, all that more uneasy.

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But, you know, we've vectored all the way down and it was, it was awesome.

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I mean, doing it by hand, there's, whoo, there's a lot to it.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Along with the GPS that slaves to the autopilot, I say, but fun to do, really, really fun to just drop out of the clouds and all of a sudden,

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
boom, there it is, right at AM Airport, right in front of you.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And it's, and that's nicely lit.

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's a huge airport where, you know, big jets come in.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Not 747s, but, you know, vacation like 727s, I think 737s can make it in.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Nice long runway, and so, you know, that was really good.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And completed the landing and went into the jet center, because you can't just land at the airport anymore.

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You have to have a handling agent.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So it costs like a 300 bucks to fucking be handled.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Which means they pick you up from your plane with an umbrella, take you into where you pay,

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and then shut it out the back.

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And if you want, you can get a cup of coffee, big deal.

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But didn't nice enough folks there.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So then we went to my mom's house.

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It was exactly one year ago this week that I was in Utrecht,

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
for just before and just after the holidays,

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
where my mom was scheduled to have a lung removed,

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
due to lung cancer.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And this was all podcasts back in the day.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Those of you who are just tuning into the daily source code,

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and I was podcasting from the hotel room.

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It was a weird, a very weird Christmas.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And she survived.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know, of the 15% of people who survived that,

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and are declared cancer-free, she made it.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But throughout the year, she's had another flare-up,

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
but not in her, quote, crucial organs, but in on her side,

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
tumor, which was removed.

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And now there's some more cell activity going on there.

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And if anything, it's fear.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know, that's what's really freaking everybody out.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's the unknown.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's not knowing what we're at.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What we're up against.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I must say, having all the emails to support really,

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
really helps.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You feel all of a sudden you feel a lot less alone.

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And you also realize how big this problem is.

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's so fucking medieval.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's what struck me this morning when I woke up is,

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you know, to see someone sick,

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
but actually, you know,

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I want to use the word wilting away,

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
but you can see it.

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's literally eating at you.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And it's like medieval, man.

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's like the, you know,

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
with all the technology we have,

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
it's seen so unbelievable that you,

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
there's no fucking magic pill or something.

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And you know, this is really the only case

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in our immediate family and friend, you know,

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
surroundings that we've witnessed this.

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And of course, it to be this close is a major bummer.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But, you know, mom's positive.

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
She really is, but she's really afraid.

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And she's tired of it.

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know, she's tired of this fighting the whole year.

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And now it just has to continue.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So my sisters and I are,

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
you know, going to go at it full speed.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Going to support her.

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And unfortunately, Tiffany,

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
my oldest sister who was two years younger than I am.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She lives in Holland.

201
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So she, of course,

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
is the closest in proximity.

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Willow, my younger sister,

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
who was four years younger than I.

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
She lives in Italy.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So, um,

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
now, of course, I'm shuddling back and forth

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
between here in San Francisco.

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So I'm pretty sure that we're going to get

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
our instrument rating very quickly.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So that when I am back here,

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I can just make quick day trips to go and see,

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
see mom.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Because the broader my airport is really,

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
it's very conveniently located

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
to where she lives.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Only half hour by cab.

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And actually, we called taxi Eric.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Tea to the E to come pick us up.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And he was there last year when my mom

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
in the hospital.

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So it was a good, good hang.

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We had fun.

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We laughed.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
My sister came down.

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So that was a lot of fun.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And Bob, my mom's a new husband.

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
She got married to a couple of years ago.

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, he, of course, took the day off.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And it was really good.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It was just a couple hours.

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But it was, you know,

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
enough to really raise her spirits.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And so that was cool.

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So humbled by all of that.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Back to the airport.

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I wanted to make it back before dark.

238
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Now, of course, we were running a little late.

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Now, this was not a problem.

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Even though the wind commander couldn't come with me.

241
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We had Roy, who is actually my IFR instrument instructor.

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And I'd never flown with Roy before.

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You know, we'd done all kinds of other ground classes together.

244
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But he is the absolute king of instrument flying

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
in the Netherlands and Belgium.

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He's just awesome.

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's raided on everything, can fly everything.

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And he's a nerd.

249
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He works like Ericsson or something, doing something really high-tech on the mobile networks.

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm not quite sure.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But, you know, he's got a flight sim at home with multi-screens.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So we flew home.

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was beautiful.

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It was, you know, the sun was, we were flying into the sunset,

255
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
if you will.

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You know, just trying to basically catch up with the sun

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
as it was setting.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It was so smooth sailing.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It was like we were on a cable car almost.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It was so beautiful.

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Could trim the plane, you know, perfectly hands off

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
most of the time, just looking at the surroundings,

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
talking with Roy about stuff.

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So it was great.

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
By the time we reached the coast of Dover though,

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the sun had set and it was about four PM local time.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And we knew we're going to be making an approach in the dark,

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
which neither of us had ever done at Ferrox,

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
which has a reasonably short strip, actually.

270
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And although they're open until six,

271
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and they do have the runway lit.

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I think there's a difference between a runway that's lit,

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
you know, like having seen Rotterdam airport with the center line

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
is a row of lights and there's just lights everywhere.

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You know, it's a beautiful sight.

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We actually passed over the airport once

277
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
because we couldn't even see it.

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Then we saw the runway.

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And it was like there had some street lights on,

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
casting some kind of glow onto it.

281
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But, you know, no center line,

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
just basically two rows of white lights

283
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and land in the between there somewhere, if you don't mind.

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And all of a sudden there was a lot of activity

285
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
there were people doing touching goes

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and the dark people coming in who were kind of doing the same thing

287
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that we were doing.

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I would say probably one of the most dangerous times

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
at a small airfield or maybe any airfield

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
is around this time when people are kind of rushing to get home

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
or maybe they just got caught in the dark.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Now the experience, we had the experience on board,

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
so I was not worried at all.

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But we did, so we actually did one go around

295
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
as, you know, we were like,

296
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
stirred in row for landing

297
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and the guy right in front of us really

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
was slow getting in.

299
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We were much, you know, much faster aircraft

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and we were hanging everything out

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
to slow us down, gear down,

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
flaps down, everything.

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And so we actually had to go around

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
because he wasn't getting off the runway fast enough.

305
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So, you know, did another pass.

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That was actually good because then I got

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
a lot better feel for the situation

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
of where I was and I could actually recall now

309
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
because of course I've done landings there.

310
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You know, what the base and the final leg

311
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
should feel like still came in high.

312
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Which is really cool because even though

313
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the runway is lit like shit

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and the basic principle of two red,

315
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
your dead, two white, your two high

316
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and the white and red, you know,

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
it's just red and white is just right

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
or whatever the, whatever way you're supposed to remember that.

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So I could pick up the glide path.

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But we were going definitely doing 80 knots

321
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
that was too fast, put in full flaps

322
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and you know, really when you do full flaps on an aircraft

323
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
like that, it becomes a whole different type of machine

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and it's almost like you're, you're batman wings

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
have inflated and you're kind of coasting down

326
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but add to that the depth perception.

327
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We definitely landed about almost halfway

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
up the runway which, you know,

329
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
at the speed we had was really too fast

330
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and the amount of runway we had left.

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
In fact, I said to Roy, I said, dude,

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
we're going to run out of runway

333
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and we both started working the brakes

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and, you know, that was a tense moment.

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It definitely got a little bit exciting there

336
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
with, you know, wheels locking up

337
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
which of course completely ruins the tires

338
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and you two new tires now but we stopped

339
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
before the end of the runway

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
but it was, it was one of those experiences

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that you're glad you had someone really experienced

342
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
next to you so that you know

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that you're not just an idiot but this is,

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I would also sometimes go, I don't know.

345
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I was like, ah, okay, we're back.

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So the whole day really drained completely

347
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and so that's why I didn't do a show yesterday.

348
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Anyway, so only positive vibes, ladies and gentlemen,

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
that's the best thing we've got going for us.

350
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Just a couple more things that I wanted to hit on here

351
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I found, or actually I got a link to a video,

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
a piece of video from the Hawaiian Association of podcasters

353
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
who just had a meeting the other day up

354
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and I don't know where in Hawaii

355
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and it's really cool because the video,

356
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
you know, some of the people are talking

357
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and they met at this great restaurant, great food

358
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and they had that all in video

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
but really what was cool is they were talking about

360
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
how they felt to me like is that the podcasters

361
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and Hawaii, you know, finally they're able to free themselves

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and spread some of their culture,

363
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
which is there is a definite culture happening in Hawaii,

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
you know, local news, local music

365
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and they're able to spread that around now, you know,

366
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
because, you know, really there was no economic model

367
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
particularly on the cost side

368
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
to get that stuff out.

369
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And it's really nice to see that and I think

370
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
we're going to see more of these really locations

371
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
that just because the economic model of installing

372
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
broadcasting for structure

373
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
would never allow that culture to flow out

374
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
now that's starting to happen, you know,

375
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I can't wait to see that happen, for example,

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
in Jamaica, that's going to be freaking awesome.

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Thank you all very much for answering my questions

378
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
about the television series Lost.

379
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is low in calling it in from Fresno, California,

380
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
home with us, no more podcasters,

381
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
no more.lipsen.com.

382
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Just want to let you know from one loss

383
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to another that the show is on hiatus,

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
like a lot of other TV shows to line up for May sweeps.

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It definitely sucks, but that's how

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
network television people do it.

387
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Maybe when TV shows become podcast,

388
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
only we won't have to deal with this kind of junk.

389
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't fret, though,

390
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
we're only halfway through the series,

391
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
so once the hiatus is over with,

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
they say January 11th,

393
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
there should be about 15 more episodes

394
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
give or take.

395
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Anyway, just wanted to help a fellow lost out of count.

396
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Love the source code, listen every day,

397
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
it's like opening up a Christmas gift five days a week.

398
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Catch you later.

399
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Thank you.

400
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
For as Matt Snowgrass would say, Adam,

401
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
come on, man, you were in the TV biz.

402
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You know that they're on break of new episodes,

403
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
fall like November sweeps.

404
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They'll probably tease you with some new episodes in late January,

405
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and then back full time for February sweeps.

406
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This is also, so the networks can put

407
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
out the midseason replacements.

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, of course, during this time.

409
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What are the midseason replacements this year?

410
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I've not been following that at all,

411
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
but I definitely missed loss.

412
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It just goes to show that, you know,

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
what an opportunity here to attach or to first

414
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
make the episodes of lost for pay.

415
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's fine.

416
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Make it a podcast, so I, you know,

417
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
it'll just show up.

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And if you know this is going to be a two or three week hiatus,

419
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
put some melts in there,

420
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
put something cool in the feed to tide me over, you know?

421
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
God, the needle's in, you pull it out,

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
you're going to gem it back in.

423
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That really sucks.

424
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hey, man,

425
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
we don't stop at Christmas time.

426
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Shoot.

427
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I mean, I wanted to do this.

428
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Unfortunately, it doesn't work on UK cell phones,

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and I only have UK Skype in numbers.

430
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But someone sent me this link.

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll figure out how to put that together for tomorrow's show.

432
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It'll be great.

433
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Where you can get a phone call from Sir Richard Branson,

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
which is completely assembled audio based upon what you,

435
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
what you entered.

436
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's really only for travel agents.

437
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And it's kind of like an incentive call from Sir Richard,

438
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and the someone sent it to me,

439
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and I was like, oh, it's interesting.

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So I filled out my US cell number,

441
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and low and behold,

442
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
then like four minutes at rang,

443
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and it was Sir Richard Branson with a personalized message from me.

444
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I want to get that rolling for tomorrow.

445
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's just that I don't have telephone recording equipment.

446
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I can do it through Skype,

447
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but you couldn't enter anything but a US phone number.

448
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So let that be a tease for you for tomorrow's

449
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
thank God it's Friday edition.

450
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I just wanted to mention some things that are happening on Sirius.

451
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This is pretty much this stuff couldn't happen

452
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
on any other venue than satellite radio.

453
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Sirius is a press release that I got from at least Brown,

454
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
who's also our press contact over there.

455
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
She says that Sirius satellite radio

456
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
will broadcast Christmas masses live

457
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
from St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.

458
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And what I like about this is,

459
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
you know, there's obviously there's no commercial model,

460
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
which is why I don't think any terrestrial radio broadcasts

461
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
amass, certainly not in, well,

462
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm not 100% sure,

463
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
but I don't think they're doing that in New York.

464
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You know, the time has just become so incredibly

465
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
precious and every single minute has to be sold.

466
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And here's Sirius who has arguably enough bandwidth

467
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and they're just, what channel are they doing it on?

468
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Let me see.

469
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Sirius Channel 86, what is that normally?

470
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Certainly they have something.

471
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I wonder what channel 86,

472
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
maybe that's just one of those channels that's kind of empty.

473
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Anyway, if you're listening to this podcast on Sirius satellite radio,

474
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
you've heard me say this before.

475
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We've got a, like a 24 minute and 30 second window

476
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and we're about to close that.

477
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So that we can get on with all the real cool stuff, right?

478
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Which you guys got to tune out.

479
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The podcast continues.

480
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So Pacific Coast,

481
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Hellway is next followed by yeast radio,

482
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
followed by Dawn and Drew,

483
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and we take it on up until 10 o'clock with some pod safe,

484
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
pod safe music as well.

485
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Still to come here on the podcast.

486
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
As I said, we've got some rare audio of Al Jol,

487
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
John's, wait, Al Jolson.

488
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Why did I say Jolson? Al Jolson.

489
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And some history there, which particularly this holiday season,

490
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
you might be interested in.

491
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We're going to talk a little bit about some more shave.

492
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's unbelievable.

493
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's not, I also, I'm the epicenter for all things shaving,

494
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
but it seems like there's a lot of different information

495
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and thoughts and theories on what gives you the best,

496
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the closest and the most valuable shave.

497
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And it's not necessarily what the company,

498
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
what the shaving kit manufacturers are telling us.

499
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And we've also got two new pod safe music tunes coming up on the way.

500
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So that's, that's still to come.

501
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Man, I'm really beat today.

502
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I feel so incredibly tired.

503
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
All right, everybody, do what,

504
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
we're going to do the same thing we do every single day around this time.

505
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Raise your right hand.

506
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
If you're in traffic, hold on to the steering wheel with your left.

507
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Okay.

508
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And wave goodbye to all those satellite listeners,

509
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
so we can get on with the podcast.

510
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Bye, everybody.

511
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We'll see you tomorrow on the Friday show.

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And for you, I got some cool shit you can listen to on your own time.

513
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The scenes that show commentary, stories,

514
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
using an observation from Ross and Karen.

515
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The sarcastic American and a rye Canadian

516
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
joined us in cross border, match and money.

517
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We have friends.

518
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We have friends.

519
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We have friends.

520
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
We've got to burn my butt.

521
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What?

522
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't like the way that sounds.

523
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Toronto, my hometown, which I miss and loves.

524
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Can we have your hair?

525
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
We've got to be sick in him and he's disappointed in us.

526
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I swear like a longshoreman at a hook or convention.

527
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You're just going to show up in his grave and drop trout and let it go.

528
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Just raw meat creep you out.

529
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Ross and I shut up.

530
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You drink wine out of a box and all of a sudden you have standards.

531
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't know.

532
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

533
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Would you sign my wood?

534
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm very much an 80m difference.

535
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh my god.

536
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Well, what's our damage?

537
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Well.

538
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And there you go.

539
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's why we love Target.

540
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yet again.

541
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And we're not sponsored by Target.

542
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
No.

543
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Am I the only one or is Bob the builder kind of pornographic?

544
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I like the Union suit.

545
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I think it's cool.

546
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Well, by the time the cops got out of Tim Horton's and made it to our door.

547
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The ZNZ show.

548
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We're not carrying cancer here.

549
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
We're just podcasting.

550
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What do you want for nothing?

554
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Species exploration.

555
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The European Space Agency sent some light guns in the space.

556
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It didn't kill him.

557
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
There are no more phenomena.

558
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's called the coming great dissension or the Luciferian angien.

559
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Nanotechnology.

560
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And carbon nanofibers or nanotubes.

561
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Make a cable that can literally reach tens of thousands of miles.

562
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Alienly.

563
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Obduction.

564
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The alien gospel simply this.

565
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That way the aliens are your progenitors.

566
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Journey into the unknown.

567
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Travel through time.

568
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The past.

569
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The future.

570
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Unleash your mind.

574
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Hello.

575
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Hello.

576
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Can anyone hear me?

577
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
This is Captain Corval of the United Defense Force.

578
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
My ship's been disabled and I'm adrift in the shadow of one of Neptune's moons.

579
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
If anyone is receiving this transmission, please get it to UDF command.

580
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
In front of presence of tar-that invasion forces, currently inbound to the homeworld.

581
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And they are not tipped towing in.

582
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Their ships number in the hundreds.

583
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And they're impossibly huge.

584
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't think you're coming to shake hands people.

585
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
They're loaded to take us out.

586
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Our homeworld is in ruins.

587
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Our future is in doubt.

588
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This will be a battle unlike any in our history.

589
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And it's outcome will decide who are the chosen ones.

590
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We are all children of creation.

591
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But which of us are the children of the gods?

592
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Join the fight for survival and children of the gods.

593
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Do you believe anything is possible?

594
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
We do.

595
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
We are a flank.

596
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We believe in an internet that's safe from viruses and scammers.

597
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We're a Earthling.

598
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
We believe your personal information should be just that, personal.

599
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And we believe your internet should be a friend, not a foe.

600
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
We're a flank.

601
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Make this smart choice.

We revolve around you.

605
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay, so I don't have a partner on my show where I talk about our sex lives.

606
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I haven't taken a dump and talked about it.

607
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I haven't dumped in my tank to get my car to run.

608
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I haven't put my grandma on her tank.

609
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I haven't talked about how I'm going to shave tomorrow.

610
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But I have talked to many great independent musicians in southwest Ohio.

611
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Where they talk about their songs, their music, and what it takes to get their stuff.

612
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
To get their stuff to you.

613
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Join us on the Miami Valley Musiccast.

615

And our promos are under 30 seconds.

616
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Excellent rich thanks.

617
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Hey, about that Earthling spot.

618
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oops, when I just got, oh, hold on a second.

619
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's so crystal.

620
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Almost second.

621
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And then show.

622
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't have to do them.

623
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Belly.

624
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
That's my PA, my Dutch PA, who now lives in Switzerland.

625
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And we had a talk scheduled for today.

626
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Okay.

627
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Go a crystal.

628
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Great. Thank you.

629
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
About the Earthling spot.

630
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Now, I personally think we're under such an, yes, crystal.

631
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay.

632
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I personally think we're under something really important here.

633
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's something really good as we work on changing what advertising means.

634
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I have three different user-generated commercials about Earthling.

635
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
People who actually like their service or have used their service in the past.

636
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And I really want to use those instead of the cookie cutter, like 30 second commercial.

637
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And unfortunately, now with Christmas time is very hard to get a hold of people.

638
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But I am really working on, I'm getting together with this, with this advertiser

639
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and talking to them about the possibilities and hopefully being able to, you know,

640
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
get some trials going and track some of this stuff.

641
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And I do believe that it's much more powerful to have your customers make your commercials

642
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
than it is for you to make the commercials.

643
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's just a thought, you know, by the way, even though they were completely produced.

644
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That's what Apple did with their, what is it with their switch commercials or whatever.

645
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And you know what, so people start to parry to them, too.

646
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That's great.

647
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Anyway, so I'm working on that, just so you know.

648
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
There was one, there was a promo that didn't get, didn't get into that lineup for some reason.

649
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Actually, I know why because I put it in the wrong place.

650
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But this is something that we talked about the other day on the source code.

651
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And already there's a promo ready to roll.

652
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I think that it's a piece of art that you're going to like to listen to this Christmas.

653
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Hey, everybody.

654
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
This is the seed of Chris daily.

655
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I want to welcome you to the feed for the upcoming podcast Christmas Carol.

656
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I have come in.

657
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, shut up.

658
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh, man.

659
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I really messed that up.

660
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Sorry.

661
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I didn't mean to say shut up.

662
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But I just got really frustrated.

663
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Okay.

664
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That was the seed.

665
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We don't want the damn seed.

666
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Where is it?

667
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, God.

668
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, no.

669
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm never going to be able to find this.

670
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's the, what I'm looking for here is the podcast Christmas Carol.

671
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Maybe I can, I shouldn't have subscribed to that feed and iTunes.

672
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, here it is.

673
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Podcast Christmas Carol.

674
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Don't tell me.

675
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I have to.

676
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Isn't that the one?

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Is that exactly what I just played?

678
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Let me try it.

679
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Hold on.

680
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Hey, everybody.

681
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This shit.

682
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Maybe it comes later on.

683
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't know.

684
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
This is what it gives story.

685
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We have final to cast.

686
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Blow me.

687
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay.

688
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Let me go look for that.

689
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I want to play a song.

690
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And while that's playing, I'll go look and see if I can find the right

691
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
audience.

692
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It was a great fucking promo too.

693
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I can't believe that.

694
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm just placed it.

695
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Wait a minute.

696
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Wait a minute.

697
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Let me check over here.

698
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Shit.

699
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Okay.

700
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't want to take up any more of your time.

701
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:13,000
An email that came to me from my partner and co-founder Ron Bloom.

702
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Turns out, well, let me read the, what he sent to me.

703
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Al Jolson, the star of the first talking movie or talkie was a famous and infamous

704
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
artist.

705
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't know if he can be famous and infamous at the same time.

706
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He was originally a canter and then became a Vaudeville pop singer and starred in the first

707
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
talking picture of the jazz singer.

708
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
He's a bit of history for you.

709
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Now, it turns out that Al Jolson is Ron's cousin on his mom's side.

710
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And she circulated an email, bless her heart.

711
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
She circulated an email with a file to a whole bunch of members of the Bloom family.

712
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
This is where he sings the Israeli National Anthem.

713
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
As Ron writes, he was later also ostracized for being a white person, quote, in parentheses

714
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
a Jew, playing a black person in black face.

715
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So Ron thought it might be interesting to give the suspense going along with the following

716
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
article, so that he encloses article from the American film Institute about the jazz singer.

717
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And it really is a fascinating story.

718
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What's really fascinating is the change that the industry underwent.

719
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And actually the movie studios tried to build a cartel to check this out, to lock people

720
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,000
into certain sound formats so that they really had a doopily on talking movies.

721
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And how people laughed and said it would never happen.

722
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And it wasn't worth it and people weren't interested.

723
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's just fascinating reading.

724
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So if we can't get a link to wherever that information is from, I'll drop the whole piece

725
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
into the show notes.

726
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And again, can I just thank everybody for maintaining those show notes, man.

727
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Wiki's really do rule in some cases.

728
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So check this out.

729
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's some pretty rare audio.

730
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's about three minutes of Al Jolson singing the Israeli National Anthem.

731
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Hello.

732
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh.

733
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000

Oh.

745
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh.

746
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Oh.

747
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Oh.

748
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Oh.

749
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh.

750
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh.

751
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh.

752
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh.

753
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Oh.

754
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Oh.

755
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh.

756
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Oh.

757
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh.

758
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000

760
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh.

761
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000

763
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh.

764
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,500
Oh.

765
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,500
Oh.

766
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh.

767
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh.

768
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
