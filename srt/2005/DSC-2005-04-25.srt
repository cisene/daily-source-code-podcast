00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Daily source code for Monday, April 25th, 2005.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're DJ!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I you don't!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped in my ass.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Do you need me?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everybody welcome to your daily source code to start of a new week at the 25th of April.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And we are in the big lady green thing at the cottage.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Welcome to your daily source code.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When I try and highlight everything that's going on about podcasting, play some promos,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
bringing the latest pod save music, got some mashups, not one but two today.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And our pod save tune is something special.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a horrible day outside, at least it's gray.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I guess this is the typical British weather you would imagine if you think of what Britain is like.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And of course the reputation that it has.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's not like that every single day, but today definitely right on par.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm all alone in the cottage because what Christine has at school took her off for early this morning.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And Patricia is off to London with her sister Ivonne.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And Ivonne's daughter, Roxy, who is 22, I think.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So despite the rain, the girls are going to make the best of it.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's not our honor, it's not our honor, it's our honor, it's our honor.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Plenty of talk about today.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The cast blaster beta has been put out there.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Although if you've submitted, it'll take at least a week and a half before you actually receive the cast blaster.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you're chosen, I know it sounds all political and shit, but it really isn't.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, let me put this way, I've learned a tremendous amount about windows.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It was about time for me to join the other 95% of the world and see what's going on.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And men, you guys are so damn critical.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
At least in the audio department, it really has really not that fun the way this stuff works.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Everything works different.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Every hardware manufacturer, every sound card has a different way of explaining what their mixer looks like.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And to get it all to work in the cast blaster is reasonably challenging.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So if you haven't seen the posting on www.curry.com, here's the deal.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You download this little program called CBMT, which stands for cast blaster mixer test.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This only works on Windows XP, by the way.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So I'm sorry, people running Windows 2000 or Macintosh's.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This beta is not going to be for you.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You download it, you run it. It basically does a scan of your mixer.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It tells us what your mixer is doing, what it calls certain things.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because that apparently is not standard across all Windows machines and sound cards.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you're looking for a, for instance, the stereo mix portion of a mixer in a sound card.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Some may call it the stereo mixer.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Some may call it the red fader.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So basically we have to build up a database of all different types of sound cards.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's just fucking horrendous. It makes absolutely no sense.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I did it that way.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But here we are. And that's what we have to deal with.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So to answer the questions right off the bat,

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
there probably won't be a version for Windows 2000.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And they're, I can almost positively say they will not be a version for the Macintosh.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And by the way, believe me, I'm totally bummed out because I am a Mac guy.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm just for obvious business reasons.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mainly because most of the world is on Windows.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're creating this as a Windows application.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But there is some solace in all of this.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
After the first round of testing,

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
they will open up to a public, public beta.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What is going to happen essentially with the cast blaster?

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
After we get through the first phase, which will include being able to record an MP3 file

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and save that on your desktop,

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the next round will be tied into the podshow.com service.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So that when it'll save the file to your desktop,

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but it'll also upload it, create your RSS feed.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know, all the stuff that everyone is doing.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is not our number, the number one part of our mission.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In fact, I'd say it's,

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
well, it's high on the list.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Again, we want it to make easy for people to listen to podcast.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And one way of doing that is getting lots of people to podcast

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
who have a couple of listeners.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then that culture and that community starts to breed upon itself

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and people help each other out.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But we still have to make it a hell of a lot easier.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Personally, this is the type of interface that I've always wanted

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to use for podcasting straight from the computer,

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
which is kind of, you know,

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
our new version of the radio studio, right?

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But it has to be simple because otherwise,

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you can just get so bogged down in features and options.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I just want something that just works.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So people can play a couple of promos or jingles or music

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
or whatever it is.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Have some auto leveling in there,

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
which the cast blaster does have.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So we can start to protect people's ear drums

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
from blowing them out by playing really loud audio clips.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What we're planning on doing though,

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and I think this is the exciting part,

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
is once we've got the cast blaster up and running and working,

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
we're going to open up the API to the podshow.com system,

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
which means that any developer can basically create an application

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
that will work with podshow.com.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Which I think is extremely exciting,

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
if I look at the universe out there,

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
of applications for all platforms,

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
for windows, for Mac, for Linux, mobile devices.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There are so many programs,

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and many of you are using them like audacity,

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
or maybe you're using sound recorder or something like that.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So essentially, all that will happen,

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and I'm trivializing the all that will happen,

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
is that developers will just add a little gateway to our API,

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and they'll be able to add a podcast button to any software

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
that already exists.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I think this is really exciting,

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
because we'll see a whole,

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
hopefully we'll foster a whole development community of recording devices,

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
basically, because once you have the podcast and taken care of,

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
all you have to do literally is just, you know,

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
drop in that functionality, connect up,

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and then provide a way for your users to log in,

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
so it's just a username and a password,

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and you're off to the races.

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So if you don't like the interface,

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
for instance, that the cast blaster provides,

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
if you think it should work a different way,

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
if we're just going to work better for you,

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and believe me, there is no right and wrong when it comes to this stuff.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I mean, having been around radio studios for years,

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and having built several,

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
it's, you know, it's an art.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's not, well, it's science as well,

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
but it's just, you know, whatever you find easy.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
In fact, many broadcast studios today,

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
come highly configurable, so that the, you know,

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the station engineer, presumably,

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
in dialogue with the people who are going to use the system,

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and the setup can actually, you know, customize it.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I like to have my microphone over here,

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and I like to have my, my music controls here,

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and, you know, maybe I want one on the right,

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and you know, whatever it is,

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you'll be able to set all of that up.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So that's coming with the cast blaster in data now, officially,

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and we're choosing people based upon their sound cards right now.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't feel bad if we haven't gotten to you.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It shouldn't be more than three weeks

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
until we get to the public beta, maybe four.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Of course, the part of the development team

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
has to go on vacation, too, right?

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He can hit you with a mashup.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is, is when I found on,

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
through ipodder.org.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is from the hitmaker,

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
who does a podcast of all his mashups.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
A brand new way to listen to 70s rock and roll.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He was like the first time versus foreigner

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
on your daily source code.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is from the hitmaker.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is from the hitmaker.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is from the hitmaker.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is from the hitmaker.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is from the hitmaker.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is from the hitmaker.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is from the hitmaker.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is from the hitmaker.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is from the hitmaker.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is from the hitmaker.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is from the hitmaker.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is from the hitmaker.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is from the hitmaker.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is from the hitmaker.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is from the hitmaker.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
this is from the hitmaker.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is from the hitmaker.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is from the hitmaker.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is from the hitmaker.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
this is from the hitmaker.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000

00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We're going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have waited a lifetime, spend my time so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full and I'm so full

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We're going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:31,900
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little little bit of a little bit of that little bit of a little bit of an opportunity to do a little bit more of a little bit drill out the dough to make it more easy.

187
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,520
You know what, guys?

188
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,600
Ohh, guys so heavy

189
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,880
Are you still hungry or something like that, SlBoy?

190
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,600
Sorry to hear you fighting!

191
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,920
Great

192
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,660
You know what I'm trying to do, man

193
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Open up the door

194
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Open up the door

195
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
Open up the door

196
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660

00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,660
Open up the door

203
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Open up the door

204
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Open up the door

205
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Open up the door

206
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
Open up the door

207
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Open up the door

208
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
Open up the door

209
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Open up the door

210
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
Open up the door

Open up the door

Open up the door

213
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,660
Open up the door

214
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Open up the door

215
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,660
Open up the door

216
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,660
Open up the door

217
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Open up the door

Open up the door

225
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Open up the door

226
00:13:43,660 --> 00:14:13,620
Woo, stick it in your ear, man, blue-bram, thick-jones,

227
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,620
probably tripping out of there here in this one.

228
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,620
The hit maker feels like the first time versus foreigner,

229
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,620
fantastic mashup to get the wheat cranked.

230
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,620
Of course, I loaded this into one of the jingle cartridges,

231
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,620
so I don't know exactly when it's gonna end, right?

232
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,620
Don't have a progress bar on that one.

233
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,620
Too much stuff to play.

234
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Yo, oh, man.

235
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
A little music heavy on today's show,

236
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620
but that's okay.

237
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
As I said, I have another mashup coming,

238
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,620
and let's see, a piece I wanted to play

239
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,620
from the vinyl podcast, and of course,

240
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
got a couple of promos for you.

241
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Yeah, I know, I'm a word nerd.

242
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Hey, you might be one, too.

243
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,620
Are you curious about words and language?

244
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,620
Then check out the word nerds.

245
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Go to the word nerds.org.

246
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,620
Go ahead, be a nerd.

247
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,620
Be proud of it.

248
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
Right on.

249
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,620
We love the nerds.

250
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Hey, I got new glasses, everybody.

251
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,620
I'm gonna be a nerd.

252
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
We were in town on Saturday,

253
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,620
and basically I used to wear contact lens.

254
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
I think I've told you this before.

255
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,620
I used to wear contact lenses all the time.

256
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,620
The disposable type, which you could basically keep in your eyes,

257
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,620
I don't know.

258
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,620
It says a day, but I think I usually kept them a week,

259
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,620
and I had the week lenses that I kept in for a month.

260
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,620
And it wasn't until I've also mentioned this until I started doing

261
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,620
some night flying, when I put my glasses on,

262
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
and was able to do an AB comparison.

263
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,620
I was like, whoa, I'm missing a hell of a lot,

264
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,620
by looking at the world through contact lenses.

265
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,620
And so it was, was this about a year ago,

266
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,620
I did a promotional spot when I was still doing the radio gig

267
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,620
in the Netherlands for a big chain of eyewear stores.

268
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,620
And I guess something was fucked up in the sales department.

269
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,620
They didn't really have any budget left or whatever.

270
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,620
I said, you know, fuck, I just give me a year supply of contacts,

271
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,620
and give me, you know, give me a pair of glasses.

272
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
And that's when I got the rose colored glasses,

273
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,620
which I've received plenty of comments about.

274
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Although I really enjoy looking through the world,

275
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,620
looking at the world through rose colored glasses.

276
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
It is true, it does just make you kind of happy.

277
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,620
And they also gave me a pair of great prescriptions,

278
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,620
sung glasses, which I used for all my flying,

279
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,620
because they're intended for driving,

280
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,620
so you can see the more clarity in colors,

281
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,620
more hue, or more whatever the hell it is.

282
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,620
But they're great, because you can really see definition

283
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
between clouds and other aircraft.

284
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,620
So I like them a lot.

285
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
But it was definitely time for something new,

286
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,620
not only because, well, you know,

287
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,620
you just want to like, got to change your glasses, right?

288
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,620
So I got, and we were actually looking at some,

289
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,620
what my daughter, Christina, was calling emo glasses.

290
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
So that would be like the black horn rim glasses,

291
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,620
and you put a band A to the middle, almost bought a pair.

292
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,620
Instead, I got this wonderful pair of,

293
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,620
what are these?

294
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,620
Oh, they are brand, actually.

295
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,620
They weren't that expensive.

296
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,620
They're Bugari.

297
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,620
And this time I went for a very light blue tint.

298
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,620
It's just something about the tint that just makes it all work.

299
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,620
And so they're very comfortable,

300
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,620
and they work extremely well.

301
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,620
And I'm going back today after I do the podcast.

302
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,620
Right now it's noon, it's three minutes past 12

303
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,620
in the afternoon, UK time, local time.

304
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,620
I'm going back to have an eye test done,

305
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,620
because I am going to go back and get some more contacts,

306
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,620
because there are just certain times when contacts

307
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,620
or are convenient, I guess.

308
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,620
And as I was thinking about all this,

309
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,620
I saw a new podcast come through an iPod.

310
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Or by the way, I apologize for the big porn picture

311
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,620
that was on the homepage the other day.

312
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
In the way it works is,

313
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,620
there's a whole bunch of scripts and little programs

314
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,620
that run to parse through this entire directory,

315
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,620
a whole lot of stuff that come from basically anywhere,

316
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,620
anywhere within the directory of a new podcast is listed.

317
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,620
It's supposed to bring that to the top.

318
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
And then it automatically posts those on the homepage,

319
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,620
and then I usually do a scan to see if there's no spam in there.

320
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,620
Believe me, there's plenty of people spamming that all the time.

321
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,620
And I think this was the porn cast,

322
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
which I got nothing against the porn cast.

323
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,620
I know who's doing this is Ed,

324
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,620
who created the porn cast in Holland.

325
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,620
But I guess it was a JavaScript or something

326
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,620
if you didn't actually, until you actually clicked on something on the page,

327
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,620
this image wouldn't appear, so I didn't catch it.

328
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,620
And of course, I was asleep while in the States,

329
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,620
everyone was freaking out about this picture on the homepage.

330
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,620
So I just removed the picture.

331
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm not going to remove the listing for the porn cast,

332
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,620
of course, because that's up to you if you want to subscribe or listen to that.

333
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,620
But that was going a bit far, I think.

334
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Anyway, my point is, I came across a great podcast

335
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,620
that I just wanted to share a couple of bits with you.

336
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
I downloaded the whole thing.

337
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
Let's just listen to this for a second.

338
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,620
Hi, I'm Marlene and I live in Seattle.

339
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,620
And I have only just recently discovered

340
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:11,620
the phenomenon of podcasting and being someone who loves audio

341
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,620
and has played with audio for all of my life.

342
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,620
I immediately wanted to jump into it and give it a shot.

343
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,620
So I've been playing with it my whole adult life too, Marlene.

344
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
A shot.

345
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:35,620
So I've started a podcast called Marlene by ear.

346
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:44,620
And it's my blog is going to be called the blind spot blog.

347
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:51,620
And the website is www.blindcast.com.

348
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,620
You're starting to catch on, right?

349
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,620
And in case you hadn't figured out, I happened to be blind.

350
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,620
So Marlene does a podcast.

351
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,620
And with her husband, who is, she calls him the board guy.

352
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,620
They also do a radio show, I think, in Seattle.

353
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,620
But when she's doing the podcast, her husband is called the I guy.

354
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,620
But he has his own disability, he's in a wheelchair.

355
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,620
So this is a wonderful pair.

356
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,620
But it's great.

357
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,620
They went to the Museum of Flight in Seattle,

358
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,620
which by the way is where the Hercules is based,

359
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,620
known to some incorrectly as the Spruce Goose,

360
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,620
that's how it hues enormous wooden aircraft.

361
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,620
If you've seen the movie The Aviator, then you know what I'm talking about.

362
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,620
So they go to the Museum.

363
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,620
They do some flying in the simulator.

364
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,620
They hook up with seeing eye dogs as puppies,

365
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
who are going to be trained to be seeing eye dogs.

366
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
But really, it just hit me.

367
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,620
It's like, wow, you know, where is the entire community

368
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,620
to do podcasts for blind people?

369
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,620
It must be out there.

370
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,620
You know, can't we, and believe me, if someone will help me produce,

371
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
I'd be happy to do it.

372
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,620
You know, we should have readings of newspapers.

373
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,620
We should have readings of magazines of, you know,

374
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,620
all kinds of stuff.

375
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,620
There are lots of people out there who really

376
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
would like to do something with podcasts.

377
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,620
But maybe, you know, maybe you're just not,

378
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
you don't know what to say.

379
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,620
Maybe you have no content.

380
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Hey, there's plenty to be done for the blind community.

381
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,620
And the community is obviously huge.

382
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,620
And what an opportunity.

383
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,620
What an opportunity to do some great, great stuff

384
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,620
for an entire segment of the population

385
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,620
that has really been crippled by today's media.

386
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
Yes, sure.

387
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,620
We've got close captions on television and, you know,

388
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,620
we have radio, but, you know, to really be able to expand

389
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:42,620
into any, any area that currently is not sufficiently served

390
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,620
by, by the media by, I hate saying,

391
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,620
well, I guess I can say traditional media or mainstream media,

392
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,620
you know, radio and television and newspapers,

393
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,620
all in print as well.

394
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,620
It's just a great opportunity.

395
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
So think about that.

396
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
And of course, you should check out,

397
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
Marlene, by ear, her podcast,

398
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
which you can find in today's show notes

399
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,620
for the daily source code at dailysourcecode.com.

400
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,620
Hey, Adam.

401
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,620
It's Chris from the Technoblog.com audio feed.

402
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,620
Just sending the promo over.

403
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,620
So you know who we are and what we do.

404
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,620
What do we talk about on the Technoblog.com audio feed?

405
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
Well, we talk about video games.

406
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,620
It's their main topic because it's a huge industry

407
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
and you gotta know what you're doing.

408
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,620
You know, so you don't buy some grabs.

409
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,620
So we're going to make sure that you know what you're buying

410
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
and know you'll enjoy it.

411
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,620
What else do we talk about?

412
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,620
We talk about the new systems that aren't even out yet.

413
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,620
We got the new Xbox.

414
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,620
Everyone's coming out with these new systems.

415
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,620
And you can't know whether it's worth buying or not.

416
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,620
And we're going to tell you.

417
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,620
We're going to talk about the new as it comes out.

418
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,620
So that you can be an informed buyer when those come out on the shelf.

419
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,620
So what are you waiting for?

420
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,620
Go to Technoblog.com right now.

421
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,620
And sign up for the Technoblog audio feed.

422
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,620
Just throw it in your RSS reader and you're set to go.

423
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,620
Because the Technoblog.com we take live.

424
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
One CPU cycle at a time.

425
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,620
Now back to you Adam and the daily source code.

426
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,620
See, it always happens just when I'm recording the show.

427
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,620
I start to get phone calls.

428
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,620
So that was Crystal the PA from Holland.

429
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,620
So I'll have to call her back in a second.

430
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,620
She just have to wait.

431
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,620
I'm so sorry.

432
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
Doing the podcast.

433
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,620
I was listening to Morning Coffee Notes.

434
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,620
That's Dave Winner's podcast.

435
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,620
And he was in Seattle.

436
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,620
And he was there with.

437
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,620
Oh, man, I should really open up my browser.

438
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
My browser should not.

439
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:32,620
I was either with Mr. Terone from the formerly of the Engadget podcast.

440
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,620
And he was there with one other person who I think was from Microsoft.

441
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,620
Oh, that's my.

442
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,620
My voice mail telling me that Crystal is left a message.

443
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,620
Hold on a second.

444
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,620
I've opened up Firefox here.

445
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Let me just see here to Starbucks.

446
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,620
Yeah, coffee notes podcast.

447
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Filterone who is left.

448
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Engadget.

449
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,620
And is the Engadget podcast now gone?

450
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,620
Is that now a gaping hole in the podcast industry that needs to be filled?

451
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,620
It might be.

452
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,620
He's now at Make Mag.

453
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,620
And oh, Beth goes a Microsoft.

454
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
So they were in Kirkland Washington.

455
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
I guess that's near Seattle.

456
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,620
And the audio wasn't too great.

457
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,620
So I'm not going to play any of that.

458
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,620
But what was really interesting was the thought that came up.

459
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,620
I think it was Beth who mentioned it.

460
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,620
That wouldn't be awesome.

461
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,620
If, you know, now we have these satellite companies.

462
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,620
These satellite radio companies.

463
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,620
Examine serious.

464
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,620
If there could be a channel, which we could flow podcasts through.

465
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,620
You know, and she called it kind of like a community.

466
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,620
Was it like a community access channel.

467
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Which sounded a lot like what openpodcast.org is doing.

468
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
Which I love.

469
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
I'm a subscriber.

470
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,620
That's one of the feeds that I listened to all the time.

471
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,620
I've been a pro.

472
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,620
Most of the time.

473
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
I've been a pro.

474
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,620
Most of the time.

475
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,620
Sometimes they actually communicate through openpodcast.org.

476
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,620
And, you know, one person will say something to the person will come back.

477
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,620
And you can access it through different ways.

478
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,620
You can dial in with a phone number.

479
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
They've got and just leave a voice mail.

480
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,620
And I get sent out of this podcast.

481
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,620
Or I think you can email a URL where your MP3 file can be found.

482
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
I don't know if you can actually mail an MP3 file itself.

483
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,620
Of course, you'd have to have some kind of.

484
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,620
It's going to sound like gatekeeper controls.

485
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,620
But I guess that's kind of what it is because, you know,

486
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,620
I see with iPod.org, as I mentioned earlier,

487
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,620
people will just spam the shit out of anything that's wide open.

488
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
So you have to have some kind of controls on it to.

489
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,620
You determine what goes through.

490
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,620
Based upon not necessarily content, but probably length.

491
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,620
You know, imagine someone tying up the community access channel for.

492
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,620
For hours.

493
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
So you have to put some kind of time limit on it.

494
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,620
But I thought that's a great idea.

495
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
And I thought that's something I've got to talk about.

496
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
Talk to some people about.

497
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,620
I really, really like that idea.

498
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,620
And I was on my way to the US.

499
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
I think the last trip.

500
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,620
And by the way, I may be leaving Wednesday again for a quick.

501
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,620
Lightning tour of San Francisco and New York.

502
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,620
That's not entirely set in stone, but it looks like that's going to happen.

503
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,620
So I might leave Wednesday and come back during the weekend.

504
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Oh, yeah, it's busy.

505
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
And I'm a big fan of the vinyl podcast.

506
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
And the vinyl, but Cody does the vinyl podcast.

507
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,620
What does he call it to fair use of music that's out of print.

508
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,620
He plays vinyl records from his own collection.

509
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,620
And he played a song which we've all heard a million times.

510
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,620
I guarantee you've heard this.

511
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,620
If you've been listening to music since the 80s.

512
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,620
The early 80s, even hip hop, you have heard pieces of this song.

513
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,620
Predominantly the sample of the drum bongo beat.

514
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,620
That is featured predominantly throughout the track.

515
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,620
And there's really this whole break at a certain point.

516
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,620
And you'll just say, oh, man, I've heard this in so many hip hop records.

517
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
One of the most sampled songs.

518
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
The incredible bongo band.

519
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,620
I'm not going to play the whole wind up because Cody does a whole intro to every single time he plays

520
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,620
a tune about the background of the song and the singers and etc.

521
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,620
And some of the history.

522
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
So I'm going to skip that.

523
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,620
You can find them at vinylpodcast.org.

524
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
And of course, it'll be listed in the show notes.

525
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,620
But check out a little bit of his intro and then groove along to the incredible bongo band.

526
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,620
Welcome to the vinylpodcast.

527
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
Fair use of forgotten music.

528
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,620
It was supposed to, it wasn't supposed to rewind.

529
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,620
It was supposed to start when I cut it up.

530
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,620
Hold on.

531
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
And it's worse.

532
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,620
The group sounds like a cross between a marching band and a cheesy big band.

533
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,620
But at its best, the percussion breaks a rock solid and funky.

534
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,620
My general feeling is that Apache, the incredible bongo band's cover of the shadow's song,

535
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,620
often veers toward the cheesy.

536
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,620
But I long ago cease to be a reliable critic of this song.

537
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,620
It all sounds good to me because I know what's coming a little more than two minutes into the song.

538
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,620
One of the funkiest and most iconic drum breaks I've ever heard.

539
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,620
These drums were a staple of early hip hop played in the parks by Africa Bandbada,

540
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,620
covered by sugar hill gang and sampled over and over again.

541
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
I just love them.

542
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,620
So do me a favor.

543
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,620
Bear with this track for a couple of minutes or if it's just too much to bear, fast forward a little.

544
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,620
Here's a passive struck by the incredible bongo band on the vinyl podcast.

545
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,620
Now crank this shit up.

546
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,620
Recognize it.

547
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
Oh yeah, baby.

548
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,620
Oh yeah.

549
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,620

Oh yeah.

557
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
Oh yeah.

558
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,620
Oh yeah.

559
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,620
Oh yeah.

560
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,620
Oh yeah.

561
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,620
Oh yeah.

562
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,620
Oh yeah.

563
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Oh yeah.

564
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,620
Oh yeah.

565
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,620
Oh yeah.

566
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,620
Oh yeah.

567
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,620
Oh yeah.

568
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,620
Oh yeah.

569
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Oh yeah.

570
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,620
Oh yeah.

571
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,620
Oh yeah.

572
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,620
Oh yeah.

573
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,620
Oh yeah.

574
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,620
Oh yeah.

575
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Oh yeah.

576
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
Oh.

577
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
Oh yeah.

578
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,620
Oh yeah.

579
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Oh yeah.

580
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Oh yeah.

581
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
Oh yeah.

582
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,620
Oh.

583
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,620
Oh yeah.

584
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,620
Oh yeah.

585
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Oh yeah.

586
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,620
Yeah.

587
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,620
Oh yeah.

588
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,620
Yes.

589
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Oh whoa.

590
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
Oh whoa.

591
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Oh whoa.

592
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,620
Oh whoa.

593
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
Oh.

594
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:38,620
So you can just imagine me sitting in the airplane, I got up, had this song on the headphones.

595
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,620
You need to go for a bathroom break and then all of a sudden the Vongo break came and it just tripped me out.

596
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
I was freaking in the aisles.

597
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
Why it almost made me want to rap?

598
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,620
Oh yeah.

599
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,620
Yeah, one, two, three.

600
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Yeah, one, two, three.

601
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Oh.

602
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,620
Yeah.

603
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,620
Oh, my name is Matterbox.

604
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,620
Catch with large army.

605
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
The fuck's your ladies and I'm my best part.

606
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
I'm going down in history.

607
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
As the widest part has never built.

608
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,620
So I'm feeling the highs.

609
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,620
And you're feeling the lows.

610
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,620
And the beat starts to happen.

611
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,620
Two, two, two, three.

612
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,620
I've got a degree in rap.

613
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,620
I've got a PhD in rap.

614
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,620
I'm cannon here on the source probe.

615
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,620

Okay.

630
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,620
Okay.

631
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,620
Okay.

632
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,620
Okay.

633
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,620
Okay.

634
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,620
Okay.

635
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
Okay.

636
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,620
Okay.

637
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,620
Okay.

638
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Okay.

639
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Okay.

640
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,620
Okay.

641
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,620
Okay.

642
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Okay.

643
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Okay.

644
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
Okay.

645
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:56,620
Okay.

646
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,620

Okay.

651
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
So, you get the picture, right?

652
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,620
Incredible, Bongo Band.

653
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,620
If you want to hear the whole vinyl podcast all the information and the link to the show of course can be found in the show

654
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,620
notes for today's daily source code.

655
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,620
So, this is just another, you know, perfect example of how

656
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:20,620
We can work to adjust the music industry to give us this stuff.

657
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,620
You know?

658
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Like, man, this is like so incredibly valuable,

659
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,340
So incredibly valuable and look at all the hits that were based upon this and you know, if you

660
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,980
Taking to account where people are doing with mashups, there's so much stuff that can be done

661
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
It's to me. It's extremely exciting

662
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,580
say

663
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,780
Have you ever gotten the feeling that you want to listen to a kid rebel about random stuff? Sure

664
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,340
Have you

665
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
Ever wanted to

666
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,380
Know the opinions of the younger generation. Yeah the source code mini ever have that fetish

667
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,700
to

668
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
Listen in on a kid's mind

669
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,080
Definitely well guess what now you can and

670
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
You could check

671
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,540
Oops, I don't know what happened there. Why did that that wasn't supposed to happen? Let's try that again

672
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,820
See we can get that

673
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,180
promo roll it well

674
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,660
Shoot so for some reason it unloaded. Okay. It's the source code mini

675
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,380
13-year-old podcaster and yes, indeed

676
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:27,580
I am subscribed I definitely want to live inside the head of a 13-year-old because well, I've got a 14-year-old here and you know

677
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,980
I got to pay attention to what's going on basically

678
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,180
This is one that I caught from the dawn and do show. They played this and

679
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:41,100
Found a link to the song in their show notes so I'll reciprocate and put this one into my show notes for today

680
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,500
You got to love the song about podcasting. This is podcast star on the daily source code

681
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,260
Just have to be a big man. I'll bet it's too well

682
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,620
She wants fame and I just want her back

683
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,260
It's up a microphone recorded some thoughts what I was alone

684
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,940
Looking for love. I found what I could be

685
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,940
With the knowledge

686
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,940
With the knowledge

687
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,240
I just want to be a podcast star

688
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,340
I just want to be a podcast star

689
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,000
I just want to be a podcast star

690
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,420
I just want to be a podcast

691
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,940
Good with my friend, Pat, we cut a little weekly podcast called this, and that.

692
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,940
Until if you joke, then spill our bones of you.

693
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Once you will.

694
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,940
Stop it, I really suck.

695
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,940
Now it's fun to watch as I know, but it's grown.

696
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Tell all your friends who you listen to.

697
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,940
I want to be as popular as doing it true.

698
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,940
Don't let true, don't let true.

699
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,940
I just want to be a protestist.

700
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:31,940
I just want to be a protestist.

701
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:38,940
I just want to be a protestist.

702
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,940
I just want to be a protestist.

703
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,940
I want to be a protestist.

704
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,940
I want a young time, I can't until I drop

705
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:57,940
Follow the history, look at me, at me, at me, at me, at me, at me

706
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Take good home, America, is a roof for us in this hysteria

707
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:24,940
Someone famous, one release, I want to be a star, can I have it please?

708
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:35,940
I just want to be a fighter star, I just want to be a fighter star

709
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:53,940
I just want to be a fighter star, I just want to be a fighter star

710
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:04,380
Man, how much does that rock?

711
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,940
I just want to pay a podcast star on your daily store's code.

712
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,780
Hi there, Adam.

713
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,780
My name is Annie Rubens, and today I want to tell you something about an endangered species.

714
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:28,020
The species is almost extinct, and as far as I know, there's only two of them left,

715
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,220
two of those little funny creatures.

716
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:40,020
And well, the species is German female podcasters, and the only thing you can do to help

717
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,620
us not get extinct is listen to our shows, and mine can be found, it's a three minute

718
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:53,620
daily podcast show, and it can be found at www.annigroobens.de, and it is called Schlaflos

719
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,380
in München, which means sleepless in Munich, okay?

720
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,380
I hope you tune into that.

721
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Thank you, bye-bye.

722
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:08,740
All right, thank you very much.

723
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,260
One more problem to go, then I got a mashup before I got to get out of here, sis.

724
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
Hello?

725
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Oh, unable to play.

726
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
The hell was that?

727
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:21,420
Ooh, I got a cast blaster error, this is cool, oh by the way, I have upgraded to beta version

00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:40,020

731
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,260

Baby I need your love

743
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,440
Who is inside to have all your joy shown?

744
00:40:43,440 --> 00:41:12,440
We're now in the four tops Ebay, I need your love and at the end of the daily source code for Monday, April 25th, 2005.

745
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,440
And I got a lot to do today as I said.

746
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,440
We actually have some financial stuff to take care of, which means paying the bills.

747
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,440
And that's why crystal is calling.

748
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,440
I also got to get those contact lenses.

749
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,440
And oh yeah, remember, I got to talk to Chris from Podcast Alan.

750
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:42,440
It seems he's found out a sure fireproof way to stop all the voting scams and the cheating that's going

751
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
on.

752
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,440
He's really figured it out this time, which I'm excited about.

753
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Do you want the ratings to be as honest as possible obviously?

754
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,440
I think I'm going to get him on.

755
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
Maybe I'll have him on the show for tomorrow.

756
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,440
We'll talk about what he's doing because the results may change significantly.

757
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
And some of the folks are in the top.

758
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,440
And no longer be in the top five or ten.

759
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,440
So we'll see if we can get him on the Skype tomorrow for the main review of what's going on over at Podcast Alan.

760
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Alright, that's it for today's show.

761
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Comments, Adam at Curried.com or leave it on the weblog www.curried.com.

762
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,440
You can find the podcast feed and the latest show.

And if you'd like to send a promo send it to Adam at Curried.com.

765
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,440
And the subject would DSE space promo.

766
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
And the name of your show.

767
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,440
And I'm linked to the MP3, but I can play.

768
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,440
And hopefully the cast blast will take care of all the rats.

769
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,440
Alright everybody, I'll check you tomorrow. Bye. Bye.
