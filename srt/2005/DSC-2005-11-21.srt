1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Deltis, Jared Charlie, two, eight, three.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I said three.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And it's Monday how you doing everybody.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I have the cold of the century.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we're going to have a fun source code for today.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kick it off with some mojones.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough of you.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're going to be stuck.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Trust me.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're going to drive this car.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're so I'm going to be played on radio.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Trust me.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Here's to the rear of the fence.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I trust you.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're going to travel the road.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Anywhere the wind blows.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This town's much too small.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We're going to get them all.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The world's a little tiny bowl.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Trust me.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough of you.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Nice, smiling baby.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And what you do is made.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You got it.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You got to move your hips.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Fill up your lips.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Take silicone tips.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now you're going to make it.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Trust me.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You got it.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Go and start.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Follow my advice.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
One day you realize I am always right.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Trust me.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You'll be fine.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Trust me.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Can't get enough, can't get enough, I can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Can't get enough, can't get enough of you.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Can't get enough, can't get enough, I can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough of you.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And if you can't ignore what I just said, you got a different story.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And if you can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:28,000
enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, can't get enough, God's from equivalence, not listed on the pot's sake music network he had, but... it doesn't quite long.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They declared a pot's sake, for me, to play a good morning, or could have to learn whatever you are as you can tell even the PR-40 microphone can't to conceal the fact that just about the worst cold in the world...

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Then this thing hit, see, I came back Friday morning, here in the cottage, did my show,

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,480
fell asleep on the couch for a little bit, of course, the typical jet lag symptoms.

49
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,560
How did a good night's sleep and then Saturday I took Patricia and Kristina off to Farrowks

50
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,760
to our local airport where the wind commander was waiting for us.

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,720
Actually, we had to wait for him as he was going to take Patricia and Kristina to

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,560
rotted him to surprise her dad who turned 80 just a couple of weeks ago, so it was a surprise

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,080
visit for them and they were staying overnight.

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,240
So, of course, I couldn't go, that meant also I couldn't fly them over there because

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,520
someone had to stay here with the animals and with the house and just a short, it was

56
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:30,000
completely fogged in 10 a.m. and it was just a piece soup and really just around the airport

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
to be quite honest.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,760
And that's the wind commander for you, man, he just showed up and he just circled around for

59
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,800
half an hour until he saw a whole big enough and he threw that puppy down.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,040
You could hear people at the airport saying, hi, there's a crazy Dutchman flying around.

61
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,280
That was the wind commander, but Saturday morning is when it really struck and it always

62
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,360
happens, I knew it would happen.

63
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,960
When you're on, I must have been on six different airplanes in the past, in the past

64
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,160
week and must have shaken a couple hundred of hands at the podcast Expo and this is exactly

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
what happens.

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,760
And you can almost count on it, particularly this time of year and you're in a situation

67
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,240
where an Aaron Broussell, the podpim, podcho, even gave me some of that stuff to wash

68
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
my hands with periodically.

69
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
What's that stuff?

70
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
You don't need soap and water.

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,240
You just poured on, it's kind of like alcohol based and still I got it and it's not flu or

72
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
anything.

73
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
At least I don't think it's avian flu.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,160
It's just a horrible head cold, it's just like just dripping out of my head.

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,160
So I've decided for today, we'll let promos and feedback help me along as a nice podcast

76
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,760
crutch.

77
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,360
It's a podcasters like Adam Curry's Platum, IT Conversations, Canada CBC, South China

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:16,160
Morning News, Seen Z, F1 podcast, more than 40 podcats actually, maybe yours too, can you

79
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
know what?

80
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,320
I've decided to put the songs together in an album, you know, an actual CD to make

81
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
it a bonus.

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm going to add a data DVD that's got all the garage band files and original audio material

83
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:39,800
on stuff, plus pre-ripped versions in MP3, WMA, AAC, Og Lorvis, whatever I can get my hands

84
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
on.

85
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,640
I'll be selling it independently, if it's a good price, it'll have a nice artwork, I think

86
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,800
you'll like it.

87
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,600
Even if not, you can go or get songs right now and you'll like them anyway for free.

88
00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:13,520
They're not competing because they think they can sing.

89
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,320
They're not competing because they think they can sing.

90
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:33,040
They're not competing because they think they can survive in the jungle.

91
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,320
Alright, you better get me out of here.

92
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,840
Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys, they're competing because they think they've got what it

93
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,760
takes to make it in the biz.

94
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,640
The biz is a new kind of reality show, only online, watches nine finalists battle for

95
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,240
the best job in America running a one-armed music record label.

96
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,440
They'll take on tough challenges and even tougher.

97
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,880
Each other is they try to impress music industry heavy hitters in artists like Fallaw, Jason

98
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,560
Rassie, Aac, and many more.

99
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:17,160
The biz, it's serious competition and it's only online free as AOL Music.com and you'll

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:24,040

103
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Aloha Kakko, this is Keola Doniki of Nahena Hey.net, podcasting from the winward

104
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,280
side of Hawaii Island out in the middle of the Pacific.

105
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Adam, I have a question for you.

106
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,440
What pops into your mind when you hear the words Hawaii in music?

107
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Don, of course.

108
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,120
If you think Don Ho or envision Elvis Presley standing in singing afternoon, it's time

109
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,560
to remove that of the 1960s and join the rest of us come in here in the 21st century.

110
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,920
The music scene into what he includes all of the different kinds of music you'll hear anywhere

111
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:35,320
else under rap of rock reggae new age acoustic instrumental jazz world country and more.

112
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,480
You'll get a taste of the best of all of them in the Mahemahinet Hawaiian music podcast

113
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,080
along with news, reviews, interviews and special features and even a touch of Ola La Hava

114
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,560
Iik, the Hawaiian language thrown in.

115
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,480
But best of all, you'll get a healthy dose of real Hawaiian music.

116
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,160
So what is real Hawaiian music?

117
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,600
It's whatever I say it is.

118
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,040
Heck, it's my podcast.

119
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,200
Seriously, in my first half dozen podcasts, I've featured music from artists such as Kiela Beaver,

120
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Ramiya Ward nominee, Ken E. Rai-Shell, Ino Allah, Kiela, Mahemah, Mahemah, Makah, Sons of Meho,

121
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,840
Pali and many more.

122
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,920
So tune into the Mahemahinet Hawaiian music podcast, post it every Sunday on nahenahey.net,

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,680
that's nha, nha.net, it's the next best thing to be in here.

124
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,200
Aki koko koko hui hua, I'm not a normal bundle until we meet again, take care.

125
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,640
Alright, my buddy.

126
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,920
I gotta go to Hawaii again. I was there once with, no, I've been there a couple of times.

127
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,040
I went there with a Patricia Christina Christina was really tiny.

128
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,760
I was a baby. It was a long-ass flight to from New York. I'm never forget that one.

129
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,400
But it was beautiful and I've been to Hawaii for MTV a couple of times. I think I was there for some kind of

130
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,880
indoor skateboarding extravagance. Maybe I didn't mention this before. But all I know is we got there. We did

131
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,800
like, we only had to do 25 links or something like that between videos. It was a total, totally sponsored

132
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:15,960
on location type thing. And so me and who was there trying to think, I think Ed was there?

133
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,200
I know we got, we got baked within an hour of being there. It was a fantastic time. Really,

134
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,040
really beautiful, beautiful part of the United States. So today's daily source code comes to you

135
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,320
from a very crisp and extremely bright Guilford. The sun is shining. It's, this morning,

136
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,720
was hovering around, around freezing point, a little bit below it, perhaps. And now it's probably

137
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:48,360
two or three degrees centigrade above zero. And it's absolutely beautiful. The Christmas lights will

138
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,040
be ignited on Thursday night. So yeah, I kind of get into the Christmas spirit here. There's,

139
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,400
yeah, there's a really good vibe. And the Brits, they, they do it. You know, they do it well.

140
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,440
Of course, they have, it's a little bit confusing because I haven't seen a father crisp. Well,

141
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,600
the father Christmas is Santa Claus. But it seems to me, all of the commercial messaging is

142
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,040
very, um, American centric kind of in, in the way it's being delivered. But still, you get that

143
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,480
little twang of, of real, old traditional feel. Not quite as plastic, which is, yeah, it's really,

144
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,600
it's cool. So I'm glad to be here. I'll be here for a couple more weeks, until I go back, just before the,

145
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,320
just before the Christmas holiday, I'll be going back to San Francisco for some more meetings. And

146
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,920
I think we'll be launching a bunch of stuff in the interim. So, it's where you, there's actually

147
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,040
blood now coming out of my nose. Oh, man. I don't know if you caught it. Um,

148
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,840
America online advertising now on the Daily Source Code. We're getting some interesting feedback

149
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,880
about advertisements and podcasting. Hi, Adam. I just want to leave you an audio comment about

150
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,360
how effective the I dog advertising is. Last weekend, I proposed to my girlfriend, now fiancee,

151
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,160
by giving her an eye dog with the engagement ring tied around its neck. Needless to say,

152
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,920
she's been quite enamored with the eye dog and has played with it every day since she received it.

153
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,840
The pictures on the website don't do it just this. It's really as cute as it looks and even more

154
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,840
amazing than than you, one would tend to think for such an inexpensive gift. Tier advertisers,

155
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,440
this advertising really really does work. Thanks again for the great show, Adam. Here's Adam.

156
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,720
This is Trevor Carpenter from Camario, California. I was listening to Delta Sierra Charlie

157
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,800
272 recently. You talked about Microsoft Office live and all that jazz. You implied that it would

158
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,720
help with compatibility and be all cool in that. Hello, problem there. They'll require internet

159
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,560
explorer and not allow Firefox or Safari or anything else for that matter. This bites. You know

160
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,800
that Microsoft sucks won't be so open-minded to include others. They're like technology

161
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,160
bickets. They hate anything that is not just like them. Oh, man. Don't sugar coat it. Don't

162
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:05,960
hold back, please. I don't know. When the Windows live, which I think is at www.live.com,

163
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,120
when it first came out and during that big presentation for a whole bunch of bloggers and people,

164
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,600
it actually had a little thing there that said the support for Firefox coming soon. I don't see

165
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,800
how that would make any sense for them to only support Windows Explorer. I don't think they'll

166
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,160
gain any traction. There's a lot of talk about this on the Gilmore gang this past weekend,

167
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,960
which is pretty interesting to listen to and Steve Gilmore did the another episode of Gilmore

168
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,640
Daily. You can find that at Gilmore Daily.podshow.com and also he continues to do all kinds of

169
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,360
interesting reports. A lot of it on this very topic at AttentionTech. AttentionTech.podshow.com.

170
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,600
Oh, man. I feel like absolute crap. For those of you who have been listening to the show for

171
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,760
at least a year, you know that whenever this happens to me and it happens, uh, probably twice a year,

172
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,280
Patricia's always there with her witches brew. She's got the soup with the ginger and she

173
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,000
she gave me a cup last night. I was like, I feel like so much better. And then my 15-year-old

174
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,360
comes in with her girlfriend. They raid the soup pan and they eat it all. No more medicine for the kid.

175
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,400
Hey, what's up, Adam? This is Marcus Kouch from The Seen Zene. No, Ben Podshow music rewind.

176
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,920
Now, a lot of new independent music artists are making their presence known by utilizing the

177
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,520
Podsafe music network as part of their promotional and marketing strategy. Now, I'm happy to say that

178
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,720
I've discovered one particular artist from Atlanta, Georgia who will be adding their music to the

179
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Podsafe music network this week. Now ordinarily, that wouldn't be cause for me to create such a fuss.

180
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,040
But this band has one track that you have to hear. This song not only fits in perfectly with a

181
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:58,040
mash-up type style, but it illustrates the entire problem that independent musicians have to face

182
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,520
when dealing with mainstream radio. In my opinion, this is the new anthem in Podsafe music.

183
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,680
With that, I'm happy to present heavy mojo with radio.

184
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,680
They say they want radio, they want radio, they want radio, suckers never play beyond the radio.

185
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,840
This is that way too fast and they too slow, but now nobody say they want radio, they want radio.

186
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,360
Hey, I'm sitting at the signal all across the land with my mind real tight with it. My right hand

187
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,200
Start the broadcast on the broadband. My mind sounds nice without the mind stand down. I don't take this hip hop lightly.

188
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:49,960
What you know speaking in those days tightly, the radio DJs don't like me. They rock it wrong and I rock it so rightly.

189
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,880
They play less, this mind less and smile less. It's safe, safe with sex and some violence, it's fake shit.

190
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,920
It's nonsense, it's hopeless, the whole message.

191
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:20,200
You're the radio, isn't that me too fast and they too slow, but now nobody say they want radio, they want radio.

192
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,240
My own, I can knock on in the quives home, brother known as stone, up on the microphone.

193
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,360
From the day I was born, I never did nothing wrong, I said rock all night to the bridge, no.

194
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,440
This is the radio, I bet the baby's off, you got to pay to be played. The take is off, if they're the same made.

195
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:43,800
In the same rage, it's Paul and I swear, I hear the same song all day long. I bought you before, just acting like cool to grab and talk.

196
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:50,680
Racking ball, packing gants and stuff. You call yourself that radio, I call your blood. When you go, pay something to sound like us.

197
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,480
It's slow, but now nobody say they want radio, they want radio.

198
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,280
I call the same with the label man, the other day, I said down the list and he talked like

199
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,120
a song. Keep on the meet-up, be a lot of some, we're never in a picture, me, selling my soul, I said never.

200
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,080
Showing up my songs, so they don't play long, if we don't nail song, then you put the record on.

201
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,360
I'll sing about a way to your draws and the thoughts, if it creates with some change, wherever it ice on my own.

202
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,480
The best thing, remember your next train, now you're the next king, but it's a wet train,

203
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,520
so you're soul, from my pot of gold, you never hold up the road, you been told, the home,

204
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,560
now you put the stand, my frustration, the need, in fact, it's enough that local station,

205
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,760
follow me as I back to the plantation, walk up to the home or say, we can't shut.

206
00:19:32,520 --> 00:20:01,240
I think you're right, this is an anthem man, that was kicking heavy mojo, radio and I think

207
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,560
I posted on my weblog over the weekend, at the pod save music network, which of course is the

208
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:13,320
antithesis. Is that the right word? Antithesis? Probably not. It's the antichrist, that's for sure.

209
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,160
For the for the radio business, we played over 10,000 songs, and reported over 10,000 songs,

210
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,960
so those of you who are podcasting using the pod save music network to get your,

211
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,600
your especially licensed music from all these great pod save artists,

212
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,760
don't forget to report, that's pretty, pretty damn important. When we have the metrics,

213
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,200
you know, that's when we can start to change the world. Check in the Gmail, Jefferson Dunton said

214
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,440
me an email about sound advertising in school. Hi, Adam, I've been listening to you show for

215
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,640
five months now, first read about you and why, and I think, well, waiting to see the ultrasound

216
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,440
of my first child. And after coming off the high of seeing my child for the first time, I check

217
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,920
you out, well, of course. I'm now a Delta Sierra Charliata, people of the great work. Now to the

218
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,480
point this email, I'm a teacher in British Columbia, Canada, I teach social studies in English

219
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,960
and show my kids how to use songs in other ways of studying to retain information in their long-term

220
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,440
memory. I wonder how old these kids are. One of the many examples I gave the kids was your

221
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,400
idea of sound advertising. Oh, man, don't need to do that to young children. I told them there

222
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,720
was this podcaster, so of course, they knew what that was, who whenever he burped would say,

223
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,320
ah, senseo, and that would then make the listener associate the burping sound with a coffee maker.

224
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,640
I'm not a big fan of advertising the classroom, but my students have now fallen victim to your

225
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,280
soundvertising. The other day during class presentation, where the students burped and spontaneously,

226
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,600
three or four other students in unison said, ah, senseo, another informed us that he's seen the

227
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,840
commercial for senseo just the other night. Well, I'm not sure I like the idea of soundvertising.

228
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,680
I would hate to have every sound I hear become an ad for crappy product. Hey, wait a minute,

229
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,080
senseo, I was on a crappy product that just not advertising. Okay, Jeff, well, thank you very much

230
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:00,280
for corrupting the young minds that you're responsible for. I did hear from SLOW sent to me in CC

231
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,960
chapters. One of the things are coming together, Brother Love was in the studio Saturday. This

232
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:12,200
is for the Christmas song that the podsafe artists are putting together. It's a fly-by-wire type

233
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,320
project. Although I see, so Brother Love was actually in the studio, SLOW's in New York, I think,

234
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,040
completely blew the walls down what a pistol man, bundle of energy. Very cool. Bitties came

235
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,880
in tonight. We worked for a while on the bridge. They were so unbelievably sweet and adorable.

236
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,080
And it could be blast to work with beautiful people, two of them live like a quarter mile from

237
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,680
the studio. Matthew Ebal is sending his stuff in as we speak. Now, that was the cool part about this.

238
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,000
Chances vocals have already been received. Mike Viola is coming in soon. He's from

239
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,720
Candyboardshire is Mitch Alden. I'm sure Mitch Alden is. He has a gig of the bidder on this Friday.

240
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,880
So he's actually coming to the studio. This thing is actually coming together. This is extremely cool.

241
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,880
I can't wait to hear the final result. This is going to be excellent. I can just hear all the voices

242
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:01,160
on this kind of we are the world type project breaking news feedback. What could this be?

243
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,440
Something important, I'm sure. I'm Robin. And I'm Susanne. We are inside works.com. That's

244
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:17,160
IMS-YT-W-O-R-K-S.com. Adam, because you are the podfaller, we are giving you the breaking news.

245
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,480
Podcasting history. Podcasting just got some more credibility as a relevant tool in mainstream

246
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:30,200
academia. Adam, I just got approval from my school Pacific Accreduate Institute in Santa Barbara,

247
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:38,040
California, to use our podcast as part of my graduate thesis. I expect this is a record event

248
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:45,240
in the first time ever that someone has been permitted to use their podcast as part of their thesis.

249
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,760
My production thesis is going to be on self-injurious behaviors also known as cutting. And I recognize

250
00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:00,520
this is kind of a morbid topic for some people and maybe consider a narrow issue. But really

251
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:07,480
cutting is reaching epidemic proportions in the United States and also in Europe and Adam, I'll bet

252
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,400
your daughter knows at least one person in her school that engages in cutting.

253
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:23,400
This is news you won't hear on CNN only on a podcast, but daily source code.

254
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,720
Thank you Robin and Susanne. Actually you're right, Christina and I and also Patricia have discussed

255
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,720
this a couple of times. She does know some kids who are into cutting and another friend of hers who

256
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,880
lives in the Netherlands and we've talked about this a lot. Now Christina seems to have a pretty

257
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,440
square head on her shoulders and she really doesn't understand why they do that. She's very cognizant

258
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:54,520
of it. A question I have as a parent is if you hear about this, are you obliged to then talk to

259
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:02,440
the parents of the child that is cutting? You know, these are really, really tough questions.

260
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,320
But congratulations on the both of you of forgetting podcasting yet a step further and into academia

261
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,040
because as you can tell from what I just told you earlier about soundvertizing in school,

262
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,680
we've got the good end. It's all a part of it. Hey, do you know Roger Smalls? He does the daily,

263
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:28,440
what is it? The daily small source or something like that? He's kind of, well, no, he is a weird

264
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,640
dude, but I want to make sure that you all heard his latest little podcast update. So many a couple

265
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:43,960
minutes, but this is an interesting guy. Learn there, Roger. Yeah, I'm quite excited because

266
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,800
I haven't played one of my audio clips on last week's fairly source code. I noticed that he wasn't

267
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,800
last play anymore music because he's anymore. So it's a nice little audio clip to me, he's just

268
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:02,520
now so like him and he just had to guess what there was and I think he did two out of three.

269
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,800
It made me really happy that he used it, hopefully that'll encourage a professional to make a proper quiz

270
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,200
random show because in our life it's be challenged. But one thing that did upset me was people

271
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,040
call me a stalker on that and show notes. Now don't mind how to have a little joke on his show

272
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,160
because now it doesn't mean it. But I've just done a show note. He's typing in life,

273
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,440
family that aren't true. I'd know that happens doesn't do it don't show notes. The fact

274
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,240
people was me quite a lot because I'm due through reevaluation soon and it's my social work

275
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,600
here's about these accusations then I'll be in trouble. That's the thing about the internet.

276
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,160
Someone can be on the other side of the world and it's really nasty about you about thinking about

277
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,880
consequences. And it's more of a say I'm bothering people that never met yet and I could have

278
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,760
been really big problems and I'm just really worried that leaving none with nobody to look

279
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,360
after it. Well I send a number of three months to talk to the eyeballs on on pills. The thing is

280
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,160
I can't understand that all I've ever said is to say I'm a child minor at them. I've kept

281
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:15,800
in a few fan drawings. They see masks and they're always shows on to a number of CDs. People

282
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,520
call this stalking and I just think I'm just a regular fan. Erders anyone accusing people behind

283
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,440
the Harry Potter fan podcast. They paid for us because I spend their evening fetching websites

284
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,920
about school children. So the honest, I'm sure he knew a major a list of liberty like Adam,

285
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,560
Liz, Ned, by. Then he'd spend the odd evening with a phone book in a map once or in round.

286
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,760
He wasn't. We sure that Adam would want to speak to his fans and know that he has

287
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,120
people weighing outside. Just say hello to him. I know he's right there, he needs no

288
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:57,320
ways of outs. So he's more of a stalker. A fan who's just young drawing like me or someone

289
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,920
is this word by word to everything that someone says and then write down time codes on their

290
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:10,200
show notes. And Liz, I'm making something that's creative. All I can say is that people

291
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,240
should think twice about name calling on the internet because British legal system texting

292
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:22,200
very seriously and doesn't believe in second chances. Now, I don't know if I should say this

293
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,280
now, actually, because I remember a bit of messages and I don't know if she's just

294
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,640
going to ask her that at the moment. When I can take her to the map she has and I'll say that

295
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:43,080
at the moment, I was all these accusations flying around and I'm not free at me. I can go

296
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:53,960
to bed so goodbye. Okay, now apparently Roger lives in Guilford. So hopefully you're feeling

297
00:28:54,040 --> 00:29:03,080
better, Roger. And remember, I've got a alarm system. I've got two dogs and two friends named Smith

298
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,640
and Wesson. Hey, soccer girl got re-incorporated over the weekend. That finally came together.

299
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:17,320
Purecast media wound up with an enormous bandwidth bill and they had to shut down the service.

300
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,320
I think it was a couple of guys with really good intentions who miscalculated exactly what

301
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:30,520
podcasting success can mean to your band with cost and they wound up with, I think, $6,000

302
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,280
charge automatically to their credit card and so they had to shut the service down immediately.

303
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,560
And there were a whole bunch of the queue potters were over there and

304
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,960
who worked with the, with Madge Weinstein and soccer girl incorporated and Madge gave me

305
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,720
frantic frantic calls. That was a Thursday, I think. Yeah. And so we got, I know we got soccer girl

306
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,880
up and running. I think one to wisdom and the rest of the folks should be up and running this week.

307
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,680
We're happy to help anybody out. It's a little bit early for us because we weren't quite ready to

308
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,920
present the podcast delivery networks. So we're going to let some of these folks into, at least

309
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,040
the delivery part of it. So then we'll give them, I think we're still giving a standard word

310
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,960
process of show blogs so they can just keep rolling. soccer girl has been diligently

311
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,000
porting everything over. So we're happy to have her and glad that she's back on the air and

312
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,520
glad that we were able to work that situation now because that does it really bites. And I think

313
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:30,280
probably the worst part besides having to restore all of your, your entries and your files is

314
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,320
your feed, you know, your feed changes. And you know, that, and there's no way to redirect, I guess.

315
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,960
So maybe, maybe because this event passed, you know, with such a bang that people will know about it,

316
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,160
we'll know to look and find the, it's funny because apparently soccer girl had moved previously.

317
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,480
And I had actually wondered why I didn't see any more podcast showing up. I thought she just kind of

318
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,920
given up or knew what happens all the time. And it turns out that I was still subscribed to an old

319
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,360
feed that didn't work anymore. So we got to figure out a way to make that better. That's the,

320
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,240
that's the one Achilles heel of all this stuff is that, you know, still this exporting of feeds and

321
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,760
and redirecting of URLs does not quite work yet, which, which bites. Okay, I'll talk about some

322
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,880
parts of music now in the form of some feedback. Adam, this is Albert Liefis. First of all,

323
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,240
thanks for playing my Skype or someone your daily source go 253. I really appreciate that. Thank you.

324
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:32,360
I was just calling into bad listening to your daily source go to a zero and I heard the story

325
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:39,960
about creative comments. And I really want to share my experience from a Dutch perspective.

326
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:47,640
So I am composing my music. I found my own record label to release my own music. And I became a

327
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:55,480
member of Buma. Maybe you want to explain to your listeners what Buma is. But, well, okay, since you ask,

328
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:03,800
Buma is the Dutch version of the ASCAP and or BMI. They basically collect money from broadcasters

329
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:12,520
and workplaces, bars, hotels, restaurants, anyone who plays music as a performance in front of

330
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,320
some form of audience and how small these guys collected money. Just like ASCAP, BMI, which of course

331
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:25,080
were not against. When signing a contract with that organization, something strange happens.

332
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,600
So a few weeks ago I started my own podcast and I actually played my own song. But when doing that,

333
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:41,880
I have to actually pay Buma money to do that. So I called them up this week to ask them whether

334
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,960
there are any exceptions to the rule. And they actually just plainly said to me, no, there are no exceptions.

335
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:56,200
So even if I play my own song on my own podcast, I have to pay. And I find it very, very weird.

336
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,840
And that actually forces me into looking into alternatives that are more suitable for my situation.

337
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:09,960
Because what I like about podcasting is that it is a very good media to promote your music.

338
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:17,400
And so I want to give licensed students to podcasts to say, hey, play my song as often as you like.

339
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,880
But when I'm actually a member of Buma, I can't actually really do that. Well, that's what they say.

340
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:33,240
But at least this is an information that might be useful for you. I would look in for it to

341
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,280
hear your comments about that. Yeah, thank you, Albert. Yeah, bye. You know, this is pretty

342
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,400
frightening. This is exactly what I said was it was the nightmare that could take place. Now,

343
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:49,560
I can't believe that this is the actual position that Buma is taking on this. But I said,

344
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,640
wouldn't it be messed up if all of a sudden the law came down and said, you can't play any

345
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,880
music on podcast unless it's licensed through us. Well, now that seems to be exactly what they're

346
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,560
saying, which makes no sense at all. You must have gotten someone on the phone who did know

347
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,760
what they were talking about. I would love to see that in writing. Get an email, get it on a piece of paper.

348
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,840
Because then you can take that up to the highest court. That's bullshit. You know, and I've never

349
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:23,720
looked at the Buma agreements very closely. But it makes no sense whatsoever that they can do that.

350
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,840
That they can force you to then no longer provide any other type of license to anyone else. You know,

351
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,680
that's thevery. Okay, see if you can get that in writing. I'd love to see that as an official standpoint.

352
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,640
More pod save music now in the form from a rant from our buddy, Munk.

353
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,120
Hey Adam, this is Munk and I just wanted to thank you for spending my new pod safe music

354
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,000
networks on pod people on the daily source code. As an independent artist and someone who makes

355
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,560
100% of his living from music, I've seen a lot of changes happen in my industry,

356
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,760
like digital sound and B3s, the iTunes music store, and now the pod safe music network.

357
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,720
The amazing thing is that each one of these changes has been one more piece of evidence to prove

358
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,640
how antiquated and out of touch the RIA has been with what people want. They spend more than

359
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,920
two decades fighting the technology that makes music better, more available, and more enjoyable.

360
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,680
And I'm convinced they all know their time on this earth is soon coming to an end.

361
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,920
They're out to suck every last time out of our pockets before they go the way of the a track.

362
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,800
While the rest of the world has embraced technology, the entertainment industry gatekeepers have

363
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,280
shunned it, throwing stones at it like cavemen seeing some big animal for the first time.

364
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,520
But honestly, I could not care less what happens to them.

365
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,760
Because of listening to all the great stuff that's out there now, all the amazing shows like

366
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,560
daily source code, accident hash, and Pacific Coast Hellway have shown me, the age of corporate

367
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,040
dominance in the music and entertainment industries is coming to an end, and much much sooner

368
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,840
than those bloated, myopic rat bastards think. You can be damn sure that if pod people are being

369
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:07,560
spun on as many clear channel FM robot radio stations as the multitude of podcasts, internationally,

370
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,640
that have picked up the song, I'd have record labels knocking my door down at a frenzy to

371
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,120
lay claim to the vision the podcasters and broadcast just demonstrated. Here comes the meth.

372
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,600
Some A&R guy with a polyside agree with it. He's get a seven figure salary, and I'd be left

373
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,480
fighting for the rights to my publishing. Thanks to you and the podsafe music network,

374
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,480
we are driving the last few nails into their coffins. And when we bury those

375
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,640
lethargic, technophobic, motherfuckers face down in a shallow grave, the only thing written on

376
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:43,240
their teamstones will be one word irrelevant. So happy holidays are I A&A. Enjoy one of your last

377
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,880
free rides on our backs because come 2006. We're gunning for your fat, sorry, asses.

378
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:57,000
Ah, them's fine words, monk. All right. I'll definitely play the pod people tomorrow.

379
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,200
I'll run it out of time for today. There's something I've been that's been on the agenda to talk

380
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:11,560
with, not just you about, but the Google guys. Apparently Sergei and Larry and I guess Eric

381
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,400
the CEO have been working on putting together a Google airplane. I happen to know a little bit

382
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,960
about a Google airplane. What they did is they purchased a 767 for 15 million bucks and they're

383
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,560
probably pouring another 40 into it to create. I guess kind of the equivalent Air Force one type

384
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:38,280
machine. And it will, let's see, hold about 50 passengers. One is refurbishment is complete only 50.

385
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,080
So, you know, they've got some, they'll have two state rooms, a joining laboratories, a shower,

386
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,560
after we'll be a large sitting and dining area, the rear will be 12 to 16 first

387
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:56,920
classes for guests or employees and a large galley. Apparently, and I read through a number of articles,

388
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,560
the guys did a lot of research and would be the most environmentally friendly. Let me tell you one

389
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,520
thing about aviation. I don't know where you guys are going with the plane, but if you think you're

390
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,360
going to be able to get in anywhere you want with that sucker, then you got another thing coming

391
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,240
in some big disappointments. So, someone there is feeding you information and someone is really

392
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,960
hot and horny on the idea of this plane, but it may not be the most useful business tool you can

393
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,000
think of. Because, you know, you can't just pop this thing down at any general aviation air

394
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,800
field. You got to go to major airports. You have to get a slot time. Now, these things are worth

395
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,320
money. You know, this is what these routes and slots are all about. It's not going to be simple.

396
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,320
And what airport are you going to go to? You can't get into every single airport with that aircraft.

397
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,200
It hurts me to see this. You know, of all the planes you could go by, you know, this is it's

398
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,240
not going to be functional for you. I think you'll find yourself in a lot of secondary planes

399
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,200
trying to get to where you actually want to go and you may find that your time. You don't think

400
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,240
you can just land that Heathrow with this sucker. You know, they're going to say, I don't even

401
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,840
know if you can land a big and hill with this thing or you may have to go to Manson. You know,

402
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,560
it's not going to be that easy. This is another big mistake that people make. You know, they all want

403
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,400
jets. I'll give me a jet. A jet's great, but for little hops, man, once you get a king air,

404
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,200
something with the turbo props, which has jet engines, but it has propellers and it doesn't

405
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,360
may not go quite as fast, but at least you can get into all these great small air fields.

406
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,120
And you can actually maneuver and get some value out of your machine. By the way,

407
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,920
I used to be one of those fuckers that was wrong about that stuff, too. So, you know, don't

408
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,600
take it too hard, but you guys should seriously reconsider the 767. He's a guy. He's a girl. And

409
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,440
we've got a bottle. A guy, a girl, and a bottle is a weekly internet radio show for people

410
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,480
interested in listening to an innovative wine podcast from a pair of novice wine reviewers.

411
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Join us as we visit and review both the wineries and their wines in and around Silicon Valley.

412
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:59,960
You can find us in the podcast area of iTunes or on the web at www.genb.com.

413
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,680
Hello pod listeners, this is Gabe Mac, and this is Gabe B. And we just wanted to tell you about

414
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:13,720
our show called solo.tv. That's www.xol.tv. You can also find us in the iTunes music store.

415
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,160
Basically, we have a video podcast with interviews, reviews, and cool filter films about

416
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,560
what's going on in the 3-media blogosphere. So check us out at www.zolo.tv.

417
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:32,440
Do you guys remember Pump, Pump, Pump, Pump? The first podcast for the French-speaking Mac

418
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,240
community? Well, it's me, Stefan C, and I'm back with a German version. So it's called Pump,

419
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,680
Pump, Pump, Pump, Still. It's just at Pumpcast.com slash DE because I have to re-work the

420
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,120
website at Pumpcast.com to make it in French and also in German, but also in English for the

421
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,440
presentation side, but basically I'm also on iTunes on the for the French part. I'm on the

422
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,880
iTunes music store, French. I'm already, I'm always on the top 20. For the German, it's a little

423
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,520
bit complicated. I'm not in the top 20. You have to search for me. You just search for P.O.M.

424
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,000
basically, Pump. And you're going to see directly Pump, Pump, Pump, Pump. And the variant

425
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,440
in German, Pump, Pump, Pump, The E, which you can listen directly in iTunes, subscribe to it,

426
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,240

427
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:26,280
at Pumpcast.com. And that's what I do. I do it in French. I do it in German and I also listen to

428
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,600
the daily source code, for example. Hi everybody, this is Gus Kaveta from a Better Day Media.

434
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,320
Oh yeah, they fucking took the same thumbs off of iTunes. Fuck you. Fuck you.

435
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,360
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

436
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:10,920
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

437
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,800
My god damnit. Same thumbs up. My tunes. I got to do. Winders last time. And the more you shit,

438
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,240
you did to me, the more I like winders. And I do like a global death step by the way.

439
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,080
The influence is to first wave fast on these bases of garbage. You sell with a god damn,

440
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,960
a little bit of foil on the back. So fuck you. Oh shit. Did I just don't know if I'm actually.

441
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,920
Oh man, I hope you noticed the explicit tag in iTunes before you subscribed and subsequently listened to

442
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,720
this show. Who needs video when you got audio like that? Don't you totally understand what you're

443
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:47,160
supposed to be saying? Isn't that just the perfect Apple switch commercial? Oh man. And

444
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:54,280
magic actually did by a Windows machine. It got so pissed off with all the, I think I think she's

445
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,240
still uses all her max, but I saw it, the expo running around with this huge HP. This, you know,

446
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,760
actually one that Ron Bloom has is like a fucking desktop, you know, squeezed into a mini suitcase.

447
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,200
It's just, it's a luggable. It's not a portable or laptop by handing means.

448
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,240
And I just got this horrible craved in my stomach. I'm, we're nearing the end. I think that's probably

449
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,160
good thing. Two more pieces of important feedback. One because it's from a listener.

450
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:24,200
Hold father. Hello, pod father. I'm Scott. I'm not anybody important to pod casting.

451
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,200
I can't play anything and you really don't want me to sing. But I am a listener.

452
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,920
Can I ask you to use your influence to solve a problem I have?

453
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:42,680
Now this problem may not relate to all you lucky people with iPods, but I've got a $15 MP3 player,

454
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:49,560
and it can't cope with every possible bit rate. I really need pod castes to stop sending

455
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:55,320
their pod cast out in all sorts of funny rates. You may not have the problem, but if I get a

456
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:02,600
filing code, you'd at say 40, 40, or 56 kilobytes a second, my little player can't play it. It just

457
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:09,880
shows me a message, bad file format, and skips that track. Now it's not my just, it's not just my

458
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,560
player. These rates don't work in my wife's or my son's one either, except they don't get a message

459
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:21,640
because they haven't got screens. Now it's easy for me to deal with. I opened the offending file

460
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,720
with a dacity and saved it somewhere as a user group rate. But it might not be so easy for all the

461
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,240
people out there who are not into IT. It's my job, I understand the problem, but I'm too cheeked

462
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:40,760
to buy iPods. I've got food instead. Now if we want to reach a largest number of people possible,

463
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:48,520
this needs sorted. iPods are nice, but they're not the only music player. Surely it wouldn't

464
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:56,120
limit people's creativity if you were to stand up and save. 64, 96 or 128 kilobytes a second,

465
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:02,920
please people. You've got the influence. Thank you for listening to this request.

466
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,840
Now I think you're really getting it sorted out and I would be pod save music network.

467
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,320
There's a lot in there now that even appears to me, even at my age, which isn't that different from yours.

468
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,800
Thank you.

469
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:31,320
Welcome to Whisper Pearls. I'm Michelle, I'm Jade, and we're not strippers, porn stars, sex educators,

470
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:38,200
or trollebs. We're just women. We want to talk about sex.

471
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:44,920
I hope you enjoy our podcast. Whisper Pearls, I create a filter comp.

472
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:52,680
I've been listening girls. Very interesting. Very interesting. I love hearing two women talk about

473
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,560
sex the way they do. You should definitely listen to that podcast. It's something different all together.

474
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,280
Todd Peterson says, I thought it saw a little bananas down there in my way to San Francisco. It's

475
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,120
okay Adam, I've peed in the big gulp cup at 10 and a half thousand feet over LAX and my

476
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,160
says no 182. In the old days, there was actually a two built into the floor of plans to pee into.

477
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,680
Yeah, they were leaftube. Absolutely. I've actually tried one of those in the King Air. It has a

478
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,240
suction cup on it, even. A little funnel in the whole deal. My car also shook with the sound of the

479
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,880
bananas that sound seeing two are all the memories. Now I true over 500 knots with wind noise and

480
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,040
turbine wine. Oh yeah, as Todd from the pilot cast, I think cockpit cast. Yeah.

481
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,960
And thanks to everybody who sent in email about that resilience, about the social network that

482
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,040
got basically adopted by Brazilians. That was Orcad, of course. That was Google's social network.

483
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,200
And Mr. Peter said, I had an account but left when too many Brazilians men with oil biceps asked me,

484
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:55,000
what's up? I think that would make me leave too. Adam. Yeah. What's up? Jason from San Diego.

485
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,600
Jason. What the fuck? You asked us to come up with some new names for your MM50. You give us an

486
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:09,080
action. We do it. We're sitting here waiting for you to decide which one you like to announce one of

487
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,400
the air. What's going to be the best name for the MM50? You promised some speakers and you don't

488
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:19,240
produce speaker keys. Speaker keys and don't produce. You can't do that. Well I'm waiting for

489
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:25,000
nice speakers, some MM50s and you speak a cheese and you don't produce. That ain't right. That's

490
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,840
fucked up. And let's just with don't put the comments in the email when you send it to me. Don't

491
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,480
do that. No time would you do. So I want to send you an email with the comment and you're going to

492
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:46,520
like and you're going to play it. So yeah, that's about it. Sorry. I guess I forgot all about that.

493
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,800
Maybe I just got no one sending anything in. Send me something then. Give me a name. Then I'll

494
00:47:51,800 --> 00:48:00,920
give away an MM50 and MM50 this week to someone with a great nickname for that product, which I don't

495
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,360
have here, which is in the curry condo. All right, everybody. I'm going to leave it at that for

496
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,920
today. I got to cut another pod find. I got to get that up for tomorrow on iTunes. It's going to be

497
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,680
an interesting week. Lots of stuff to do. Lots of stuff to talk about. Lots of stuff happening

498
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,600
and when I get my voice back hopefully by tomorrow will be doing lots more talking. So take care,

499
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:31,560
everybody. Bye bye. Another pod show pod cast. Stick it in your ear.
