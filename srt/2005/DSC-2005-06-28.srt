00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Shara Charley 201

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Something remarkable is happening here. Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
who've managed what you can hear since radio is invented. It's jumping into the hands

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jar.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yo DJ!

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is the 28th of June 2005. How you doing everybody?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code. This is the post mega crunch iTunes launch podcast.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Come to you from the lovely courtyard Marianne Hotel in Portland, Oregon.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's the show that I love to bring to you.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I got to tell you what a day it's been. I am pretty free.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, that's for a number of reasons. The first one being, I've been flying all day.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wow, I couldn't have planned it any better, you know.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We got this big mega crunch of bandwidth with the tens of thousands of new listeners

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and subscribers showing up at our door this morning.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And what was I doing while I was concentrating on my flaps, my car heat, my angle of attack,

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and all that groovy stuff the pilots have to learn. Because Friday I get my ticket.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, don't have a lot of tunes queued up for you for the show.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Of course, this is another hotel room podcast, which means I'm on the wireless lab.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So you'll hear a little bit of extra room noise about normal.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I'm using cast blaster, which you'll love this.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Unbeknownst to me during the nomdex keynote speech, which of course was also podcast.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Cast blaster was released.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's right, there's a public bait and now available.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Just head over to castblaster.com.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Actually, it's pretty interesting because I agreed with Mike.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Cast blaster Mike as we call him around the shop.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It was of course lead developer on the entire project.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So the real test of cast blaster will be to see if I can use this thing in this live environment

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
because they had the whole idea for doing a daily source code 200 as a part.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Actually, as the keynote, the finishing keynote of nomdex 5.0.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So what you might not have known, if you were at nomdex,

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
actually had the love Mike clipped to my jacket and that was running into the crap lit through cast blaster.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And just the output coming through the headphones,

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Jack was always being fed into the house PA system.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And I was very, very pleased with the results.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It really worked.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I was able to upload the show just a couple minutes after the keynote.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because of course, that's almost an automatic process now with cast blaster.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm really pleased with the outcome.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm very, very happy with what we have right now.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Of course, we're looking forward to implementing a lot more cool stuff in the cast blaster.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Obviously doing something about the graphical look.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Although I'm not displeased with just the standard windows stuff.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What I did know, is the one thing that I need.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And this is something we're going to definitely put on a separate development track.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You heard the daily source code episode number 200.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I, you know, with all the stuff going on on stage,

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I couldn't really fade out the tracks that were playing.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So I think I played the mashup and I played some Rob Costlo.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I just kind of cut it off midstream.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I, you know, to get your mouse over to click the fader and fade it down.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It works when you're kind of in a controlled environment,

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
but not in a live environment on stage.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So the next obvious thing to do is have a little hardware controller.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Or maybe even better yet.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And that's something I'll talk to Mike about.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Maybe some of the keyboard mappings can be mapped over to the,

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to the player slider.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Like maybe use it.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I wonder what happens if I use the arrow key here.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Doesn't, oh my goodness.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh my goodness.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It already works.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Just discovered something new.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, let me see if I can hear.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll play a bit of Rob Costlo check this out.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So now I can use the down arrow key and it basically fades it all the way down.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I used up arrow key and it fades it up.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That is phenomenal.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, there you go.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So it's already been fixed.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Didn't even have to ask for anything.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's great.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you very much, Mike.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So daily source code episode 201.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is the day that Apple launched iTunes 4.9,

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
which includes podcast and capabilities.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wow.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Lots of stuff blew up.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Lots of stuff went wrong.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But at the end of the day, it is literally the end of the day.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's 17 minutes before 12, before midnight, on the 28th.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'd say the results are phenomenal.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This morning around 9 o'clock East Coast time,

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
all of iTunes actually came to its knees.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, we had sets and stuff up.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You probably noticed this thing called the podfinder podcast,

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
which is a co-production that we're doing with Apple.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And of course, all of the podcast featured in that,

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
we're intended to be hosted on a content delivery network,

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
which would have been Akamai I believe.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And Apple was going to take care of that.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oops.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Instead of doing that, they basically pointed everything towards our servers.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now, we already have sufficient pipe, but nothing.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Nothing at all for the onslaught that we received.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So we slapped on two new servers.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
One of the 200 megabits of Dan with an hour kind of handling,

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
what's happening.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And also right now, it's a little crunchy,

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
but that's the good news, literally.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I just looked at some of the stats.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Tens of thousands of new downloaders.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So we'll call those listeners.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And an equal amount of people actually subscribing to the podcast feed.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So I could not be happier with the result.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You know, bring it on.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The 100 million listener march has started.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So I'd love to hear more feedback.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I just had a glance of the email.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Looks like everyone's reasonably happy.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Of course, as all kinds of stuff with their directory.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And are you listed or not in the feeds?

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And all this is going to start to shake out over the next couple of,

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
oh, next couple of days and probably next couple of weeks.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Because this was just people who were downloading iTunes and saying,

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
hey, I'm going to go.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I want to, you know, install this now and start using it.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But a lot of people won't get the upgraded iTunes until their software update runs.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And of course, they have to decide to install it.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So it'll probably be, I don't know what the run rate is on that for Apple's upgrades.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But it'll probably be another week or two before it's all fleshed out.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So in all, I think very successful because what no one really expected,

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
certainly not an Apple is the onslaught that podcasting was going to bring.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And it's not just the so-called quote,

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
indie podcast, which I thought was hilarious.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The Apple makes a distinction between a professional podcast.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There's an indie podcast.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But okay, you know, that's the way they want to call it.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's fine, you know.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know, they can call me whatever they want.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We know what we're doing and we know what our mission is.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And boy, do we have some exciting times ahead?

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's all good stuff, home fries.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The CC Chapman would say.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Come on, Rob, hit that last piano note for me.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's what I was waiting for.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Whew.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let me see.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What other stuff do we have to talk about?

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I guess that's really it.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's really what everyone is just all over is the Items launch.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Podcast Ali.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I believe by tomorrow will be providing anyone who's basically registered with podcast

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ali in the directory.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We'll be able to have an iTunes compliant feed.

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We're working on creating subdomains so that you could have.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You could literally map that, which means there's no lock in.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So you could say, you would want to, for instance,

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I could have daily source code dot podcast Ali dot com.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And that could actually be the default iTunes feed for you.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And of course Chris McIntyre over there is working on anything that will,

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that'll make it easier for all of us to,

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to basically provide our content.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And with this,

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
comes the very obvious path that we should be choosing as podcasters.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And that,

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
you

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay, that was like totally weird.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I got a Skype ping and then all of a sudden just blew out my microphone.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh well, hey, that's what you get when you do stuff in a hotel room.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So anyway, the clear path that we have to get on now is,

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
is a bit torrent, I think,

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
to start solving these bandwidth issues.

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And it's a completely legitimate use of peer-to-peer technology.

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And I've been thinking about it.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There is a bit torrent name space.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I'm not going to do it tonight because I really need to,

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
to get to bed because there's lots more flying to do tomorrow.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was, I prepare for my check ride for my fixed wing license on Friday.

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But I believe that we need to,

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
open up a dialogue with the aggregated developers about how to incorporate,

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
of course most iPodders and podcasters already,

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
understand bit torrent and already have it implemented.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There's just a couple of things I think we need to do to make that corner turn.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And I'm talking to lots of people.

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Doug K from IT conversations has some really smart ideas about that.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And a couple of other podcasters who also are looking at lots and lots of bandwidth to be chewed up.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So that will be coming very, very soon.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And you know what, since it is late night,

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
we're kind of hanging out.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'd say, we do a hit test.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We're just taking a hit test.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We're just taking a hit test with help.

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We can reach you.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hey, you guys, with your pilot.

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, I'm this hit test number 45.

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hey buddy.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's not much time.

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So let's start right away.

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You know how goes.

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is intro number one.

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We're on the...

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's probably a...

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh yeah.

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm going to say,

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Al steward on the border,

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think. Just off the cuff. And this is number two.

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He was born Andrew Gold, Lonely Boy.

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yon, you're playing on my favorite songs. This is great.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And the final one is always number three.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay, I probably have mentioned this one a couple of times.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's probably wrong again. It sounds like talking heads.

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And time's up. These are the answers. This is number one.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So rough, y'all. From 1977, this is L. Stears.

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, the boy got it. Great song.

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, I get a boing for that.

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
All right, number two.

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
L. Stears, answer number one. And this is answer number two.

217
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's Andrew Gold. Oh, yeah. This is Lonely Boy.

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And now, number three.

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
1977, an engine number two.

221
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It was talking heads. And Lonely Boy.

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And this is answer number three.

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The talking heads.

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What is this?

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Once in a lifetime.

226
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
From 81, the talking heads. Once in a lifetime.

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, that's it for today. By the way, all the clips you just heard and also the clips from the last couple of hit tests were all edited and created by Richard Richard.

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't you know, he's been helping me out tremendously because of my lack of time due to the current circumstances.

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That has to do with my current situation.

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You can hear all about it in the hit test podcast and all information about that podcast.

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So this hit test can be found at jompolet.com. That's J-A-N-P-O-L-E-T.com.

232
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The address for feedback, as always, is hit test at jmail.com.

233
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, Adam, I hope you did well. They were fairly easy to show you.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Should have done well.

235
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Join us next time for hit test number 46.

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So see you next time. Until then, bye-bye.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All right, young women, I get a little another boing there for at least getting the talking hands rise.

238
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know what the title is.

239
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay, you know what?

240
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I still have some pod show for serious stuff.

241
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I want to record and then I want to get a good night's sleep.

242
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Tomorrow, more flying, we're here in Portland at a little 80-bit airport.

243
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's called Aurora State, uncontrolled field.

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And I did about two and a half hours of flying today.

245
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Tomorrow, some ground school.

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then probably do about three hours of flying.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Then another three hours of flying, I think, on Thursday.

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Then I'm Friday, the examiner.

249
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think you'll be doing my check right around noon.

250
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And hopefully, if I've done everything right,

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and I've got my head on straight, then I'll be able to get my ticket as we call it.

252
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
My wings for fixed wing for regular aircraft in addition to my helicopter license.

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And it's kind of a weird time to be doing this.

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But this has been planned for like nine or ten months.

255
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And quite honestly, we've had our head so down and working so hard on just on so much stuff

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and talking to people and we're working with a whole bunch of podcasters.

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And I've set up before, if you're interested in looking what the pod show family can do for you.

258
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Just drop me an email, add them at curry.com.

259
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And we'll be happy to hook you up.

260
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
One thing we can certainly provide for you, which people start eating is bandwidth.

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We're not like master buyers of bandwidth, so.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And I'm going to leave it at that.

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So I will talk to you tomorrow, maybe a little bit of sound seeing from the skies.

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And also, since I'm here in Portland, I'm going to go hook up with my buddy Ken Clark.

265
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Probably no Ken from the Ken and Squip show also from the MTV Chronicles.

266
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I mean, I haven't seen him in years and he lives here.

267
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I mean, he's backyards.

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So I've got to hook up with him.

269
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey, you know what, maybe we'll do an MTV Chronicles.

270
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We're both together.

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll be going home.

272
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That would actually be pretty fun.

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So look forward to that.

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Hey, let me know what you got going on.

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Send it to submitapodshow.com.

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If you got a promo or a podcast you want to share.

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Got some pod safe music tunes.

278
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I've been planning tonight, except for Rob Poslow, which of course is my hit newsure.

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Send it off to podsafe at podshow.com and mashups.

280
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Although I have a lot of them always looking forward to more mashups at podshow.com.

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This program can be found at datingsourceco.com.

282
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We can also find the feed to add to your iPodder or your iTunes at dailysourceco.com.

283
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And of course there's always the weblog www.curry.com.

284
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And if it's a little bit sun the sluggish side and it's kind of been and sluggish for the past

285
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
a couple of weeks we are getting all kinds of upgrades because we're blowing forward towards the future.

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And I'd love for you to participate in the 100 million listener march because we're bringing them all in as an

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
enough podcast for everyone to enjoy something.

288
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So, you know what?

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Telling this dream is finally coming true and I'm extremely excited.

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I hope you enjoyed it.

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
My friends, I will talk to you tomorrow.

292
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Take care.

293
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Stay subscribed and have yourself a great evening.

294
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Bye-bye.

295
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Another podshow podcast.

296
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Stick it in your ear.
