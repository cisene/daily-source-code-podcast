1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Pot show, no one knows how it makes it so creepy.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Delta shared Charlie 2-9 or 6.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, I dreamed.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I was rich if prior.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Running up higher than the sunset strip.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
As the flames burn brighter.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My head grew lighter.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And I watched the flesh fall from my fingertips.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ashes to ashes, trust to dust.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't know what it means.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
To be burned by something that you love so much.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I think I must be living the dream.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I think that I'm living the dream.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who I dream?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was the pilot.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, the ship lost out of sea.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's my eye.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're not hurt.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My youth reigns forever in the end.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Ashes to ashes, trust to dust.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know what it means.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
To be burned by something that you love so much.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think I must be living the dream.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think that I'm living the dream.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
My birth grew from my mouth.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I melt to my knees.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I could hear those hollow bones.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll echo back to me.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ashes to ashes, trust to dust.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know what it means.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When you try to hold on my side.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't touch.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I must be living the dream.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think that I'm living the dream.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
May he rest in peace.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Prior to Fem, Chris Mills from the wall to wall.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Fem, CD, of course from the pod tape music network.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I was just looking through the network and there it was.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just waiting for me.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think it was a new submission as well.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Everybody, how you doing?

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's the daily source code coming to you from Curry Condo.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm completely jet lagged.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Although everyone keeps saying, boy, you look really good.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You look really well rested.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And that, of course, is as usual due to virgin airlines.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Nice 10 hour flight from London to San Francisco over the weekend.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And saw two movies.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A typical trip on the way over, you know, slept a couple hours.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I saw four brothers.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wow.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is a lot of...

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There's a shitload of echo here.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There's a lot of echo, baby.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How do I change that?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
One, two.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There we go.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Ah, much better.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There we go.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now we're all intimate.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm not in the hallway.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Here we go.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, that's the movie.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I think John Singleton directed four brothers with Mark Wahlberg.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And was it Andre 3000?

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Andre 2000?

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Andre 2000.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I think John, man.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Violent, but really, really good.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I saw the 40 year old virgin, which is just perfect to watch on an airplane.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Particularly if the airline is virgin.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So that was all good.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
As I posted on my weblog, got in and immediately set about mopping off the floors here.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's condo.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I kind of left in a rush last time.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And also not having been here for three weeks.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's dust everywhere, man.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I really got to figure out someone who couldn't who can come in and clean that prior to my arrival.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So I wouldn't have been okay with all the jet lag.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hadn't it been for a whole slew of phone calls that I got Sunday morning.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The first one.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And it must have been around I'm thinking 2 a.m.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, maybe even earlier than that.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Maybe around 130 due to the explosion near Luton in the United Kingdom, which is quite a ways from where the cottages.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But of course, the minute the news came out, it was north of London and everybody was freaking out.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And it was very sweet.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Everyone was calling and saying, hey, is everything okay?

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you're spoken to Patricia, close the doors as a huge cloud of chemical crap coming your way.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't think it's going to pass anyway.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It basically the cloud is going south east.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, my goodness.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That was almost a disastrous mistake I made.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I didn't bring the Heil microphone.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I have the AKG and I have the portable sound board.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I had to, well, so I don't have the Heil microphone.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I am using the Heil box to prop up them.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have a little mini mic stand.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And on top of that's about.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let me see one, two, three for about eight CDs.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So it just barely is high enough for me to, you know, rest my hands on the bar here where the setup is in the kitchen and talk directly into the microphone.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Anyway, so we're south west of London.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So no, no problems there.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But apparently you could hear this explosion, which was three fuel tanks I believe.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You could hear it as far away as the Netherlands.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's one big freaking bang man.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll tell ya.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Lots of stuff to talk about today.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A lot of music stuff.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have a couple of pieces of audio feedback.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And of course, some interesting promos that I've weeded out from the enormous amount of submissions that come in through email and through promos.podshow.com.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is, and also a lot of things about iTunes.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know, stuff from the palm cast, palm, palm, palm cast in France.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He sent me an email with just a quick report as he calls it star academy,

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
which is a production of end em all and famous certainly in Europe.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's kind of like an idols, you know, like pop idol or American idol.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It is now also podcast.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And in the French iTunes music store in the podcast top 100, this is interesting star academy.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It shows up at number one, number four, number nine, and number 20.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And they're planning to sell those shows in the near future via iTunes.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've been getting so many reports about iTunes.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't normally look at the, at the podcast directory in iTunes.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I went over there today.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And, you know, I just clicked on music, thinking I would find some interesting music.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've really been on a big music trip here.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think I would find some interesting music podcasts.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And everything I clicked on seemed to be a podcast, but it was a mainstream podcast.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So there's the rhythmics podcast.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's the, actually, Roger Smalls mentioned the Madonna podcast.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And let me see.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If I open it right now, let me just see what's in iTunes.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hold on a second.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Because it seems like very little indie podcasts are represented anymore.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now I can hear some of you including Madge Weinstein going,

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, well, now you're finally finding out, aren't you?

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There we go.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
iTunes music store.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to go through podcast first, I guess.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, podcast directory.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Here we go.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's see.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Because it maybe was just a one-off that I hit it.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I got a whole bunch of what seemed like certainly not independent podcast.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So they've divided into new categories.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And we have music here.

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And so click on music, accessing music store.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Something's wrong with the wireless connection here.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I think it's because I have one of those television transmitters.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can transmit the TV signal from the cable box wirelessly across the room to a little receiver.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I think that's definitely interfering.

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It doesn't seem consistent, but it certainly is interfering right now.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, here we go.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So these will be the music podcast.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What do we have?

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Indy feed.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Indy feeds a good one.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
John London bus exclusive music videos.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
WXPN musicians on the record.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Amy Mann, Music and Interviews, Bruce Springsteen.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
KCRW, CVS, Radio 3, podcast.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You ridnix the ultimate collection.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Bono, the Rolling Stone interview.

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So those don't really seem to be indie podcasts.

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Some actually don't even seem to be podcasts at all.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And there was a comment on the show notes that I was just reading before I kicked off today's show.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let me see, let me just go to these.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let me just go to the notes for a second because it was a really interesting comment about iTunes top 100.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now, I think I've explained before how I believe the top 100 is still compiled.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know if they still do it that way.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But it's based upon new subscriptions to a podcast.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Of course, done to the link for the music store to subscribe to it.

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Within a certain period, which I think it's 24 hours.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm not quite sure. Okay, here it is.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So here we go.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
After listening to Rogers and this is from Paul, which Paul is not at home on his podcast, Paul.

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, I think so.

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
After listening to Rogers' funny, but mad contributions regarding the witch magic,

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I went to iTunes to look for her podcast.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That would be the Madonna podcast.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
To cut a long story short, I got sidetracked into looking through the iTunes top 100 subscribed podcast.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, top 100 subscribed podcast.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There must be something wrong with the way they calculate this list,

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
because radio force in business, which is the fabulous show with Peter Day,

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
is listed at number 34.

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Strange is there have not been any new episodes of this cast for well over two months.

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What's going on?

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, I don't know.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think that, well, it must be based upon new subscriptions.

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I mean, it's kind of a self-fulfilling.

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If you show up in, I guess, what can you actually see on the page?

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can see the top 20 podcast before you have to click through or scroll somewhere else.

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let me see, I'll just look at it right now.

196
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So if you're in there, yeah, exactly shows the top.

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't know, it shows the top 25.

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So if you're listed in there, people are obviously prone to clicking on it

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and subscribing to it, which, of course, keeps you high and list.

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But right now, if you look at it, man, it is really, it's mostly mainstream.

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So, um, glad we changed the name of, uh, I potted out org to indiepotted.org, you know?

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We still need a good place to go and look for independent podcast.

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
One more thing I had here about, uh, we were talking about lyrics and how, um,

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the RIA is now going on after websites, um, that publish lyrics and guitar, uh,

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
tablisher.

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's pretty serious now.

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The music publishers association, which isn't the RIA.

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's the, uh, it's the organiser.

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's like the RIA, but they represent sheet music companies in the United States.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Uh, they're going to launch the first campaign campaign they're calling.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's war.

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the first campaign against websites offering unlicensed song scores

213
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and lyrics, um, and who's this guy?

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Lauren Kaiser, the music publishers association president, said he, I guess it is a he.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Wanted site owners to be, check this out, jailed.

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Mr. Kaiser said he did not just want to shut websites and impose fines,

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
saying authorities can throw in some jail time.

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think we'll be a little more effective.

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Holy crap.

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Stay away from it, please.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh, man.

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That is outrageous.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I mean, surely they're, of course, first of all, yes, it's a copyright violation.

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Totally, but, you know, evaluate what you're going after here.

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know, it's not like so, not when no one's printing books.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You know, this is not from music lesson.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I guess you could print it off a website, but I find, you know, I've studied piano

229
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and I find tremendous value in a book that has all the printed information, you know,

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
all the printed lyrics in there.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Perhaps with, you know, whatever music and sheet music companies that.

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Those are really good compilations.

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've never been really able to find anything as good on the internet as I would be able

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
to find in a music store.

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And quite honestly, I think it's, it just, it really helps spread the music and helps

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
people understand what's being sung.

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And how long have we heard people say, I think Jimmy Hendrix was singing.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Instead of kiss the sky, I got to go kiss this guy, you know.

239
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay, but they are serious, so, before warned.

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I wanted to mention the podcast or con, which is coming up.

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's just so much happening.

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This is, I guess, in a way, like the portable media expo,

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it's much more like a blogger con.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And it's taking place in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on Saturday, January 7th.

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to go because I'm definitely going to be home

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
through that first week of January.

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But you can check them out at podcast or con.org.

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And if you're driving along, can't remember that.

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then, of course, you can always go to the show notes later on.

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And, and pick up all the links mentioned today's source code.

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And, and, oh, man, you're going to love this one.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is really cool.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is about mainstream media versus podcasting.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If you're listening to this on the serious satellite stars 103,

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
how you doing everybody, this is podcasting.

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We just talk about ourselves.

257
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, don't tell me this.

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh, here it is.

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Emiss, okay.

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This is, um, was this an interview?

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Now, Emiss radio division president.

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Now, Emiss radio is, uh, I don't know if they're owned by anyone in particular,

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
but they are definitely a radio group.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So, they have a number of stations.

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The division president, Rick Cummings,

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
recently told a group of Wall Street analysts.

267
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And this is coming from mediabuyerplanner.com.

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Recent told a group of Wall Street analysts that is own research

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
of his own research of college students

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
is picking up what he called iPod Fatigue.

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This is going to get so much better.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Coming said that this is his own survey amongst college students.

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
iPod Fatigue happens when younger listeners have 100 songs on their iPods

274
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
that they're sick of dealing with.

275
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The opportunity for radio said Cummings is to continue to lean on content

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and to bridge that technology with the radio audience.

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In other words, perfect,

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
like God, this is so fantastic.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
In other words, professionally produced content

280
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
can be the bridge to reaching younger listeners.

281
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
For example, coming said that Emiss is starting to offer podcasts

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and that podcasts produced by radio professionals

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
can eclipse the quality of independent sources.

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So, let me hit you with that again.

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because, you know, let's remember this guy.

286
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
All right.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What does this guy look like?

288
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What a dark.

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So, podcast produced by radio professionals.

290
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Lots of these people who are above that.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Produced by radio professionals can eclipse

292
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the quality of independent sources.

293
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay.

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, that all depends on what you call quality

295
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and then also depends on quality of what?

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Quality of sound?

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Quality of content?

298
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Dude, you are so incredibly awesome.

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hi, my name is Douglas K.

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm a singer-songwriter from Edinburgh in Scotland.

301
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I put three of my songs up on the podcast

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
music network about two or three months ago.

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's been great.

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The response I've had from it.

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The podcast from music network

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
have been sending me emails

307
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
to let me know when I've been played on podcasts,

308
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
which is really handy.

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They seem to have been coming in pretty much daily

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and sometimes twice or three times a day.

311
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Tell me that I've been played on podcasts

312
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
from police like Japan, the States, Canada

313
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and so on as well as ones here in the UK.

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And a lot of the people that put the shows together

315
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
have also been in touch asking for either sessions

316
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
or interviews or things like that,

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
which, again, is great.

318
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And in addition to that,

319
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I've had quite a few emails from people

320
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
who have heard me on these things

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and quite a few sales of

322
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
downloads and CDs and so on.

323
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And it just makes such a difference

324
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
when you know that you can get your music

325
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
out there without having to go through the regular channels

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
of radio-airplay

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
where you're sending stuff off to places

328
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and maybe two or three of the radio stations

329
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
will pick up on it.

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The podcast thing

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and through the podcasting of music network

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
is just a fantastic way of getting things out

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
because your stuff's up there

334
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
for all the pod show producers

335
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
to produce at their leisure.

336
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So I think the podcast music network

337
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
is an invaluable tool for bands and musicians

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and with the way the music industry seems to be going

339
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I think it will become increasingly important

340
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
for bands and artists who want the stuff to be heard.

341
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Douglas, thank you so much.

342
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Now besides that, I'd really like what Douglas had to say.

343
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I just love hearing someone speak in a Scottish accent.

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Fantastic.

345
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just keep sending me feedback

346
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
without accent, man.

347
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's great.

348
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And thank you very much.

349
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's exactly the way it's supposed to work.

350
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That is exactly what it was created for.

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And we're smoking our own dope over here, man.

352
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We love it, too.

353
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And Michael Butler has been kicking some major

354
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
CC Chapman, of course, as well.

355
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Just spreading the gospel, man.

356
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Just making it happen.

357
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And every thing, there's not a day that goes by

358
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
that I don't get email from an artist

359
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
or from someone who's used the pod safe music now.

360
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We're going to make some show incredibly happy.

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Really does.

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is what we were missing

363
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
to really get some good ass music out there.

364
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And again, every single day, I'm just amazed

365
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
by what's being submitted to the pod safe music network.

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
When I'm helping the limit

367
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
really kicks in.

368
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm sorry about that.

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And you know what this Frapper thing is.

370
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
FRAPPR.

371
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's a combination of,

372
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
really it's someone put something really cool

373
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
together with the Google Maps API.

374
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And you can essentially mark yourself

375
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
on a map, like a pin map.

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You know, like a region and Kathy Lee used to do.

377
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And does region still do it with whatever her name is?

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Newgirl.

379
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's a pin prick on the map when they call someone.

380
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So I have one.

381
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I have a Frapper map, which is linked from somewhere.

382
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I think it's, you can find it at curry.com.

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There's a link in the blog roll on the right hand side.

384
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But there's also one for the pod safe for piece song.

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If you haven't heard that, if every day we're Christmas,

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it's currently the most played song,

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
pod safe tune from the pod safe music network

388
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
on any podcast anywhere.

389
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Almost overtaking the all-time spot.

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Now it's definitely it's moving up even on brother love.

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So the Frapper map was created

392
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
so that if you have a pod cast, you enter your pet,

393
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
your little flag, your little little pin prick there

394
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
to show.

395
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So that you have a, we have a,

396
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
it is, you know, I'm doing a horrible job of explaining it.

397
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But it's actually really cool.

398
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Even though there's only three people on it so far.

399
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
CCC Chapman there and DJ AJ and Greg Turnbull.

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I got to add myself to it.

401
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But eventually, if we, if we get the attention of all the pod cast

402
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
just playing the song, we'll have a really cool map of

403
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
every single region that it was played in.

404
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And yesterday, I was over at my friend Greg's house.

405
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He will live here in San Francisco.

406
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It was his son's birthday two weeks ago.

407
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So I brought some presents over and had a nice home cook meal,

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
which is fantastic.

409
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And I played, pod safe for piece form.

410
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I played actually about about 20 different pod safe tracks.

411
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And he said, Adam is not a single track that I wouldn't

412
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
hesitate going to a record company in New York

413
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and representing it and pitching it.

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And I said, you know what?

415
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't think there's a single artist of any of these 20 tracks

416
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that would let you do it because they're so happy with what they're doing.

417
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Who wants the bullshit of a major label at this point in the game,

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
man?

419
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I think this is just hanging there guys.

420
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's going to happen.

421
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know, people are going to be able to just buy stuff from you.

422
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
They're going to hear about it.

423
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We're going to pop it.

424
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's going to happen.

425
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Anyway, so the pod safe for piece,

426
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Frapper map is, of course, available at the show notes.

427
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If you go for the daily source code.com,

428
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but if you want to go directly,

429
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
it's Frapper.com FRAPPR.com.

430
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And it's pod safe for piece promo is the URL for that.

431
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Okay.

432
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Let me see.

433
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I already talked about the iTunes stuff.

434
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Let's see.

435
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This was Chris.

436
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I think he was right in the book.

437
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He had a big epiphany moment here.

438
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Adam, how's it going?

439
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
My name is Chris.

440
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm the brother of Jay Mac.

441
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The main dude behind Hood hype.

442
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You probably heard of him once or twice.

443
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah.

444
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Whatever.

445
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't know.

446
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Listen, you guys,

447
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
between you and my brother,

448
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you've both inspired me into my own podcast project.

449
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And one of the things that came up when

450
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
was tossing ideas around was the concept of taking some of these

451
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
sci-fi books that I've been writing.

452
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And put them out in an audio book format.

453
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And I thought, hey, you know, why not?

454
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So here's what I'm doing.

455
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I've got a site set up right now.

456
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Temporary release site at children of the gods.blogspot.com.

457
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And basically the concept behind the project is I put together scripts that are adapted

458
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
from the books that I've been writing on.

459
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And I get these voices together.

460
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Put some sound effects to the whole thing.

461
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
A little bit of music background.

462
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And create a whole sci-fi adventure that's just mind-boggling and mind-blowing, right?

463
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So here's the thing.

464
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Recently, I saw the success of Podsafe for Peace, which brought all these people together to create a big track

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
from all over the world.

466
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And I thought, you know what?

467
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's kind of the concept that I'm looking for

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
is in terms of voices for my own project.

469
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So I'm wondering, what does it take to do something like this?

470
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
How do I get all these people together?

471
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
They have some talents or maybe they're an aspiring voice actor?

472
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Whatever.

473
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
They've got some good acting talents.

474
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And they want to get it out there.

475
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I think I've got a possible outlet for some of these folks.

476
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I want to get together with these people.

477
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And see what they can do to kind of bring this to life.

478
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Because the fact of the matter is I can only fake so many myself.

479
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And we've got quite a few characters, of course, in the script.

480
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So check it out.

481
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You can email me at deadweaselallonewordatgmail.com

482
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and saying goes for any of your listeners.

483
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And I'd be more than happy to forward a copy of the latest script.

484
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You want to take a look at it.

485
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If anybody's interested at all a taking part of it.

486
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Please do send me an email.

487
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'll send you the script.

488
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's see if we can hook up.

489
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Let's see if we can make this happen.

490
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Thanks for listening.

491
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And I'll keep doing the same.

492
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Have a good one.

493
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yo, man.

494
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I thought footballer boy at gmail.com was weird.

495
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Deadweasel really takes the top spot there.

496
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
See, I like that idea.

497
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I think you'll have no problem at all getting people to jump on that.

498
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
With all the stuff that I saw go on with podsafe for peace.

499
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We're going to see a lot of freaking collaboration in the next just in the years to come.

500
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And I, you know, please definitely keep me up to date on this project.

501
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Let me know what's happening.

502
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Let me know if people have gotten in touch with you.

503
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
She got your actors.

504
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And, you know, keep us in the loop.

505
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Maybe create a podcast of the creation or whatever.

506
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
This is exciting stuff.

507
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And what are the chances of you being Chris being Jaymax brother from hood hype?

508
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Of course, one of the few shows that features R&B and Urban in hip hop music.

509
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What are the chances of audio feedback coming from Chris referring to hood hype?

510
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And then all of a sudden, there's some interesting audio feedback from Julian Smith.

511
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
One of our very own podsafe music podshow podcasters.

512
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah.

513
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And without this as Julian from in over your head dot net.

514
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And obviously the podshow.

515
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm just a gang along with CC and extra super action show big mic.

516
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You know.

517
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And it's, you know, I thought I'd let you know.

518
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But something that I thought of while I was listening to your show 295.

519
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
There are no good hip hop podcasts out there.

520
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
No good podsafe music hip hop podcast.

521
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And I thought that was pretty funny.

522
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And still the truth, I felt kind of bad for you man.

523
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, I mean, I, you know, it's not a big deal or anything like that.

524
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And I don't want to make you, I mean, nothing to freak out over.

525
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Except for the fact that, you know, I kind of do one.

526
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And I have kind of been with podshow ever since July.

527
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And in fact, we kind of announced it on your show in July.

528
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And I remember you doing that too.

529
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And if anyway, I just, you know, I was thinking maybe that you've been high the entire time,

530
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
like the full four months or perhaps I suspect high even longer.

531
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But I mean, don't get me wrong.

532
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I love drugs.

533
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I do.

534
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I take drugs daily.

535
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I love drugs and alcohol and all sorts of really fucked up things that you would probably also like.

536
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I also love hip hop.

537
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I do.

538
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't know man.

539
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I do.

540
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I was thinking maybe I'd give you an idea of what it is that I played.

541
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I know you don't listen to my show or anything like that, but that's okay.

542
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You know, I mean, you run a company or whatever.

543
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And I'm sure that you're really busy with that.

544
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Let me give you an idea.

545
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And this is kind of the sent me an email this morning.

546
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Where is it?

547
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, yeah.

548
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
She got to find the freaking email.

549
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's always gone.

550
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm never organized.

551
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's crazy.

552
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Sound like me, man.

553
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, yeah, here we go.

554
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Alex.

555
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
In over your head number 94.

556
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, it's, it's, I've been doing shows for like a pretty crazy long time.

557
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Like almost as long as you have since November of last year.

558
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So it's, I've gone past my one year now.

559
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I've been around for a fairly long time.

560
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
In fact, you played a comment of mine.

561
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And then like, maybe December or something like that before the new year.

562
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I was really excited when I have it.

563
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's pretty cool.

564
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He says.

565
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So do specifically to you and your great show.

566
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm listening to more hip hop.

567
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Great.

568
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I dug that Jedi mind tricks and just attracted you play the other day.

569
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So much that I snagged the album.

570
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Excellent.

571
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Also picked up brother Ali.

572
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
All right, excellent because of an earlier show.

573
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Very nice.

574
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Thank you, Alex.

575
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I'm sure they appreciate it.

576
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Those two led me to find atmosphere.

577
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I played him too.

578
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Murders.

579
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I played him.

580
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
A stop.

581
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Ideal.

582
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah, I played both of them and felt.

583
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah, I've, I've played.

584
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
God, I've played a lot of hip hop.

585
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I throw out 94 shows.

586
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That's pretty crazy.

587
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So what you're hearing Julie and say besides spanking me silly.

588
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Is that once again, this stuff is really working.

589
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's good thing you owe me on my side man on your side.

590
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I mean, good thing you have me on your side.

591
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah.

592
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That would be pretty fucked up.

593
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You know what I mean?

594
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Like the only really crazy good hip hop show.

595
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's really unbelievable.

596
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I mean, there are other really good shows as well.

597
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But it's good that you have not on your side.

598
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I was just thinking.

599
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So, you know, it's really good that we're, you know, I just, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

600
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm down.

601
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I just think that, you know, maybe we could do good things together.

602
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You're looking for a good hip hop podcast and maybe even run for Pod Show.

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And I am a good hip hop podcast with Pod Show.

604
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Okay.

605
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I was thinking that it might work out maybe.

606
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Anyway, I'm really busy right now.

607
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm going to go see a hip hop show.

608
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Interesting.

609
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Enough.

610
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But I thought I'd leave you with a track that I played on my show.

611
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's got a lot of good comments.

612
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And that I think you really might enjoy.

613
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That's called Slow Down Gandhi.

614
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And it's with Sage Francis.

615
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Check it out.

616
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm sure you'll love it.

617
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Right, I'm bro.

618
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Thank you.

619
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I was looking for some good hip hop.

620
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Gosh.

621
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There once was a song called The Rest of President.

622
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Contemporary music.

623
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It was the kids.

624
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It was a top 10.

625
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I wasn't popping.

626
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So I missed the bus a bit.

627
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The politics was on everybody's heart this summer list.

628
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And the cool kids were all rockin' votes.

629
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I shit you knuck.

630
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I was pistol whipping cops for hip hop.

631
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm a slow box.

632
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yelling into mega phones.

633
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The killin' hard rocks.

634
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Shoes and cartons.

635
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And the stepping stones.

636
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And a famous addicts.

637
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I pulled him on marches.

638
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
The day the criss-coil on biscuit.

639
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Who's the final goal in marches.

640
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
My penistores.

641
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Two pull the clown on.

642
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And in fact, that's the reason for the high horse.

643
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And we're not here.

644
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I seen the rings and I'm not trying to cause the wind.

645
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm the door to wonder pros.

646
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I push a carton.

647
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
All for the sake of military reproving.

648
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
They feel they can't stake the way they target it.

649
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The students.

650
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I got a thought.

651
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Whistling Ohio.

652
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The rest of them.

653
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
They should stop doing a stay in a banner.

654
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Cricket convention.

655
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Who was they thought?

656
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
No, no, no.

657
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Who was they thought?

658
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Who was they thought?

659
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Who was they thought?

660
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Who was they thought?

661
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Who was they thought?

662
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Who was they thought?

663
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Who was they thought?

664
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Who was they thought?

665
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Who was they thought?

666
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Who was they thought?

667
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Who was they thought?

668
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Who was they thought?

669
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Who was they thought?

670
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Who was they thought?

671
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Who was they thought?

672
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Who was they thought?

673
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Who was they thought?

674
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Who was they thought.

675
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Who was they thought?

676
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Who was they thought, who was they thought?

677
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Who was they thought?

678
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Who held it?

679
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Who was they thought?

680
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Who was they thought?

681
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Paws?

682
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Why did you cut them?

683
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Why did you cut in a plane that?

684
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Paws?

685
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Paws?

686
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Paws?

687
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
All you two had continued to do this.

688
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But this is what I've got to do.

689
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What I've got to do?

690
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The four one is your own.

691
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Detailing crumbs...

692
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's definitely aywat.

693
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,720
It's death penalty versus suicidal fantasies

694
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,680
All I wanted was a fucking Pepsi

695
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,880
Institution

696
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,680
Making you think you crazy is a billion dollar industry

697
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,240
I could sell sanity in a bottle

698
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,040
They'd be charging fucking press air

699
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
They're not getting help

700
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,640
They'd be immunized welfare

701
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,040
middle class eliminated

702
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,640
Rich get richer till the poor get educated

703
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,880
But some of y'all still have been grown into your face

704
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
You face something quite match your head

705
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,040
And I'm waiting for a brain to fill the dead space that's left

706
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,680
You're all giving me ethnicity or give me dread

707
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,560
Trust a funny in-reppin' with that a cause for a long

708
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,760
Cause when push turns the shove you jump into your forefathers on

709
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,800
Seize a banker

710
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,080
Your part of the system

711
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,400
All throw the tread of blocks and comes in

712
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,760
Come the briefcase

713
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,400
The sickness is sent to the camera start rollin'

714
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000
See the fuck out of the picture bill

715
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,440
Reaching briefcase

716
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,680
The sickness is sent to the camera start rollin'

717
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,120
Pull down, run to your killin'

718
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,480
I'm Mr. Save the world

719
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,840
Spares the details

720
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
You save the females from losing interest

721
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,520
You miss saved the universe

722
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,040
You're a damsel in distress

723
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,520
Tight down to a track of isolated incidents

724
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,240
Generalize my disease, I need a taste of what it's like

725
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,200
Living off the fat of kings, I play the scape at your hunger strike

726
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,480
I'm the strike, the strike, the strike, the strike

727
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,320
Slow down, gone to your killin'

728
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,880
One love, one life, one too many victims

729
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,360
Republic, rat, Democrat, one party system

730
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,800
Media goes in a frenzy

731
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
The stripped of their credentials, presidential candidates

732
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Can't debate over this instrumental

733
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Let them freeze down, winter takes all

734
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,320
When the music settle, have Ted Nugent head hanging on my wall

735
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,640
Kill one of ours, we'll kill one of yours

736
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,600
Some friendly fire

737
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,640
That's a funny turn

738
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,600
Like civil war

739
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,920
Six in the morning police have my crib

740
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,640
Now my nice consist of two, two things in violence

741
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,080
The cruiser fixing vitamins

742
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,360
Music that is spirited

743
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,480
New flavour food made of mutated high bridge girl

744
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
They tell me that it's not that bad

745
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,680
It fucks you up good

746
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,040
But it's not that bad

747
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,600
They hold on to these tales to lift the door that wax

748
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,400
God save us all, let be less the cattle the bad

749
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,320
Bad news for what I blame for the strain

750
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,600
Of my vocal cords

751
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,160
Who can kind of hate for threat but can't hold a sword

752
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,480
It's the same who can pray in about the global war

753
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,080
But can't hold a global joke

754
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,280
But that they voted for

755
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,840
They call the shots with the nine the line of fire

756
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,480
I call the cops but they break in the line of duty

757
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,040
Let's call a stop to the abuse of authority

758
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
Truth keeps calling me

759
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,840
And I'm a lift to tell the story

760
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,880
So let's not true

761
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,160
Crits begin to give us

762
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,360
You need to cut the news

763
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,880
But you don't believe in scissors

764
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,080
Use the blood that troops

765
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,440
Don't wear a yellow ribbon

766
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,200
Just bring home a mother fucking brother

767
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,280
Just because they don't hold a shot

768
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,640
But they're in the line of fire

769
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,840
I'd like to call the cops

770
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,520
But they break in the line of duty

771
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,640
And I'm a call a stop

772
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,080
You abuse of authority

773
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,280
Truth keeps calling me

774
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,040
And I'm a lift to tell the story

775
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:28,920

00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,200
Do you know of any really good hip-hop hardcasts?

783
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,800

If I was linked to me rap on pontificate once a week

788
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,640
We did intervals on this Roy Hilly place

789
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,520
Which is fun but kind of hard at the same time

790
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,360

Hi Adam

810
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,760
Last March

811
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,120
I started listening to your show

812
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,320
I was so excited about pod casting that I actually quit my day job that very month

813
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,000
That I haven't had a steady income since

814
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,520
I've just been pod casting and getting poorer by the day

815
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,440
Well you can imagine how excited I was when I heard about the un-dition

816
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,920
A chance to quit the day job that I didn't have

817
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
And I was all over that

818
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,440
The problem is that while I was promoting my podcast I unbeknownst to myself was

819
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,840
Promoting myself all at the same time

820
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,880
Now I've been offered several jobs that are truly tempting

821
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,760
None of them however is in pod casting

822
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,680
Please Adam

823
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,520
Don't make filthy lucre the thing that loars me back save me

824
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,400
Let me un-dition with my show the car cast

854
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,040
Nice car nice airplane. I haven't heard anything about a motorcycle

855
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:05,960
Merry Christmas to all and thanks again for listening. Yo Terry. Let me tell you ma. I am definitely a rider. I have been all my life

856
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,120
I have had so many different motorcycles. I was it was ever since I saw Marlon Brando in

857
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:20,920
Was it the wild bunge was that it where he strapped that you know that that trophy to his handlebars and had to have the black leather jacket

858
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,880
So that I started off with souped up mopeds

859
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,360
You know we did all kinds of stuff man. We you know we drill out the carburetors or as we say in the UK

860
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:40,360
carburetor we'd bore that out. We'd get oversized pistons and oversized cylinder heads and take it from 50 ccs to 70 ccs and just

861
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:48,920
Unbelievable shit. We had machines running so fast and so hot of course all air cooled and there were tricks you could do with the with the Honda 50 cc

862
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,360
For stroke engine you could jam the

863
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Something with the ignition that I remember or the

864
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,600
Yeah, something it was something with the ignition you could jam the the points or something

865
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,760
Then it would run faster and we had always of tuning it and then I moved and I actually did a lot of motorcross and

866
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,440
trial riding and I had for one of the motorcross is one point ahead of Java a Java

867
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,920
Which is a is that a Yugoslav it was made in Yugoslavia. I think and

868
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,200
It was the weirdest thing. It's 350 ccs going in the one open pipe

869
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,200
Custom built frame and you actually would push the

870
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,040
The gear shift into the engine block and then turn it back and then it became the kickstarter

871
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,480
No electric start. You know always fun to try and crank 350 ccs when you're 16 years old and you know have the weight of a feather

872
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:46,680
And then later I owned two sportsters. I owned a fat boy the limited edition fat boy

873
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,760
Which I really really loved and that was one of your living in Jersey and

874
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,760
At a certain point, I just didn't have time anymore. I sold the I sold the Harley's and

875
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,600
Tooth was now it's almost it was two years ago

876
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,600
in

877
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,760
July, yes like two and a half years ago

878
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,320
Every year I would participate in this

879
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,080
Celebrity race for something called the black motorcross with black meaning illegal

880
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Which is put on by these guys who have abandoned in the eastern part of the Netherlands

881
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,480
You know very very rock and roll crowd and everyone will dress up and wacky outfits. I once went as in a prisoner outfit

882
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,720
I once went as a as a priest

883
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,200
You know and we'd always participate and it was a really it was a professional course

884
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,920
They had professional riders professional heads

885
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,000
All kinds of stunt exhibits et cetera and

886
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,320
On the last one which was that was two years ago last one I did

887
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
They put me on a KTM

888
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:54,120
450 cc motorcycle and I and you know I would drive once a year during this race

889
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,120
And the year before they gave me a 250 I think was it that this year was a 450 and I went up on one of those

890
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,440
One of those jumps and yeah, I we weren't jumping all the way over the jumps just you know

891
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,480
hook a little bit of air and then you land on the flat top surface and then you go down on the other side and

892
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,880
It was

893
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,720
Probably the third

894
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,000
The third lap and if you don't train for the shit man you have no idea what you go through your stomach is killing you

895
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,760
You just want to puke your arms are killing you. You can't feel your shoulders

896
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,760
I popped up on top of the jump and then as I as my rear wheel came back down

897
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,800
My my throttle hand hit the throttle because you know my hands my my wrist just kind of collapsed underneath the

898
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,720
The shock and

899
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,640
Boom that bike went just

900
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,280
Left right underneath me and I landed flat on my back

901
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:48,040
In fact, it was nothing wrong in my elbows or my arms because my my back absorbed the entire

902
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
The entire shock wave and

903
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,440
To this day that's still bothers me two years later

904
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:02,280
And I really kind of gave up riding after that and besides Patricia says look how many dangerous things do you want to do?

905
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,080
I she said I'm okay with the flying you know, but not but you got to quit something so

906
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,440
There you go

907
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,200
Don't ride anymore

908
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
Which is a shame because I really did like it

909
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,360
Really did

910
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:21,640
It's Russell. I'm just hasn't commentary for you on a Delta Sierra Charlie number 288

911
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,360
So don't you get the new Jaguar?

912
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,960
Thought those really cool. What you're doing with the

913
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,840
The interface system your hand where you could talk to the computer and let's tell it to do things

914
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm just had a few thoughts on that. I'm just be careful. You know don't record anything like that

915
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,920
Messing with the buttons and stuff

916
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,800
But I saw as I was just thinking about that and I've been looking for a iPod and

917
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,480
Migration system for my car and I haven't really found anything

918
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,920
I've been happy with Tradeff and transmitters, but also I was looking at

919
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,880
Bonna new hate unit to replace my CD player in the car that would interface with the iPod with their system

920
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,600
You know like from Pioneer Alpine or something like that and

921
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:05,880
Really as it's kind of thinking about it and you don't see a stereo with you know a nice screen like the iPod

922
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,680
You know, especially like iPod video or even in the nano has

923
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm you don't have a color screen like that. It's just a kind of a

924
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,320
You monochrome or you know very few colors kind of thing

925
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,680
So I was actually thinking I've been looking around internet. You could find some

926
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:27,320
Car installs with a Mac mini and I was actually looking at that and wondering if there's a way you could plug in your iPod

927
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:33,720
Have like a iTunes type interface, but simplified so that you could you know use a touch screen and push buttons

928
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,680
to navigate around your iPod and download you know play the music on there

929
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,680
to listen to it in your car this that'd be a pretty cool idea

930
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,360
Enjoy listen to your show and keep up the great work

931
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,680
I'm trying to think why I played that there was a reason for that because I'm really starting

932
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm really trying to select this stuff for you

933
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,760
I can't remember for the life of me. I was gonna say something about that. Oh, I know. Oh, oh

934
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,320
Okay, yeah, that was about the the Jaguar indeed

935
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,000
Boy man that thing was good on Patricia. Let me tell you hot night

936
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
So what I was going to say about it is

937
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,640
That you know, I'm now in San Francisco and even though we bought the Jaguar the Curry Cruiser

938
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,800
For over in the UK I still really want to do the biodeasy look experiment and I put out a shout out

939
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,600
Earlier last week that I'm really looking for some kind of diesel that we can just you know

940
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:38,280
Fuck around with an experiment with what I'm out here and we'll pour vegetable oil in it and we'll see what works and you know

941
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:44,520
We'll see we'll see how far we can get and I specifically want to be something that we you know no one's really gonna care about

942
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,680
So that you know if we mess it up then you know, we'll just be toying expenses

943
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,760
But I'm good for a couple grand for for the right diesel and today

944
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,960
Ron his

945
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,000
his nephew

946
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,520
Adam Bloom and

947
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,840
Ron's wife Marta and I went over to the new office. I think we're going into the new office

948
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,160
Tomorrow so I'll keep you up the speed on that, but you know just looking at the final

949
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,000
Final bits and pieces and as we're rounding the corner

950
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,160
There it was I could it was standing right there

951
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,880
Part by the side of the road

952
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,640
It was I I don't know what year it was from it looked like it was from you know late 70s early 80s

953
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,880
Excuse me

954
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,400
Mercedes

955
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,920
Station wagon

956
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,400
300 turbo diesel

957
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:39,160
It had it had six seats in the back so the station wagon, you know, it's not a payload

958
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,680
But it's a person load or maybe that's foldable. I don't know, but basically you have a kind of like a jump seat all the way in the back

959
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,920
Which is facing uh towards the rear

960
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,600
It was it was kind of a it wasn't quite lying it was it was a

961
00:46:53,560 --> 00:47:00,120
Hmm, it was a kind of a beige yellow type color. It was really ugly really dirty and on the back window

962
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:07,480
It literally had a sticker that said bio diesel. I'm like this is there's a reason for this god is talking to me

963
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,760
Fanta it was it was exactly the car. I wanted I could see with just a little bit of finger paint

964
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,760
We could make it in the perfect pod show mobile

965
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,320
Apparently there's no conversion no adaptation necessary

966
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,880
Maybe it even I guess it runs on biodiesel already

967
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,200
So I got really excited you know I'm looking around then some guy was walking down the street

968
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,880
Hey, uh, is this your car? I wasn't so anyway I left my business card and I wrote on the on the back of the car

969
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,840
I said and you know will you please sell me this card this car and and I wrote down my phone number

970
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,320
So hopefully we'll hear from this person and of course

971
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,600
I'm still entertaining offers if anyone has a really cool clunker that we can mess around with

972
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,200
I've got an empty parking spot right here in in the in the basement of the condo

973
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,960
So and I want to get all over this and and start some experimentation if you're listening to this on

974
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:02,360
Serious satellite radio and then you're wondering what the hell is going on this show is the start of the four-hour daily lineup on serious

975
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,960
This is the daily source code. It's a podcast and actually it's kind of cool the podcast continues

976
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,480
After we're done here on serious specific host hell why hell way hell way is up next

977
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,240

980
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,040
And meanwhile back at the ranch here

981
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,080
We've got my favorite

982
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,720
And GB welcome back to California atom it's and you be with some feedback from DSC number 294

983
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,320
It was really sweet of you to mention love spirals is an indie success story and I really appreciate that

984
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,640
But as comic strip blogger pointed out in the comments of curry dot com

985
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,760
Yeah, our cities were yeah wait a minute

986
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,480
Angie

987
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,360
When that now we're talking about comic strip blogger in in our little love messaging

988
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,160
Oh, no, no, no, no, I think we're going off track here definitely sold before podcasting in fact

989
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,000
to much of them before in be threes and a lot of them before the internet

990
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,560
Yeah, somewhere actually released on cassette and

991
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,120
They were all released on the indie label projects. So I just wanted to give them their props

992
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,160
Now I joined the band in 1999

993
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,160
and

994
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,160
began a lot of all my promotions

995
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,640
Created MP3s

996
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:32,200
Put them up and that started in a radio station and just explored all the

997
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,720
The new avenues that we're coming into being at that really exciting time

998
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,360
And tell eventually I realized that we could do most of what the label currently does for their bands

999
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,800
Into these radically changed musical environment. I mean everything is so different from when

1000
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:53,000
When Ryan first started the band. So that's why this year we decided to put out our CD

1001
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Completely independently on our own label

1002
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,040
And it's really exciting but coming from an old school background like that, you know

1003
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,880
We have some questions as to whether some of the new inventions are really better than the old standards that we're used to and

1004
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,200
Wonder in which way we should go and you seem like a really great source for advice

1005
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,080
It's been so awesome to start this topic about

1006
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,760
Whether artists with songwriting collections agencies can

1007
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,000
freely podcast or not

1008
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,800
And it's been cool to hear what everyone says all around the world

1009
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,040
Anyways, I'm really looking forward to the full launch of PMN

1010
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,560
indefinitely include love spirals in your digital sales experiment. We'll be right there with your baby

1011
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,000
In fact, I put up a new song last week in the jazz section

1012
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:42,040
And I'm hoping that you will help us pick out the new song from free and easy to add to PMN next week

1013
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,040
So get back to me tell me what you want you like

1014
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,640
It's always great to talk to you. You know, I love your throaty voice too, baby

1015
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,000
And all I can say is I wish I was up in San Francisco partying with you guys this weekend

1016
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,600
uh

1017
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,800
Party

1018
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,200
We need party. Hey Angie. I got

1019
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,520
I got your envelope. Thank you very much and thank you very much for the CD in the personal note and

1020
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,560
I will certainly

1021
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:13,400
I've been playing the CD here in in the condo and I need to hear it all the songs a couple of times and I'll tell you what I like

1022
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,960
Yeah, I like them all

1023
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,400
Obviously and by the way the panties really smelled nice

1024
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,400
So

1025
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,400
Roger smalls. This is starting to have a little life of its own

1026
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,800
I play it a couple of comments from Roger. He's been around for a while actually he's been podcasting for

1027
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,040
Probably about a year now and I got an email and I followed it up

1028
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:40,600
I'm not going to tell you who the email was from because he specifically asked me not to not to mention it

1029
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,920
But he says dude check this out and he

1030
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,560
Posted a link to a page on Google base

1031
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,520
Which will we'll put in the in the show notes he says I think you should be worried

1032
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,480
So if you read this out please don't mention who I am

1033
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,400
I told Roger that I wouldn't tell anyone but I thought you should know about it

1034
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,600
What's I of course he knows exactly what it is that was really dumb

1035
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,640
Anyway, so I didn't quite understand what it was I'm gonna go to this page now

1036
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:18,040
Uh, at base.google.com and here it says Roger smalls items

1037
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,720
And it's based here's rare hair wax tub as used by Adam Curry description and it has various pictures here too

1038
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:32,440
A real treat for fans of the podcasting pioneer pod show millionaire and former MTV presenter mister Adam Curry

1039
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:41,480
Show the podcast enthusiast in your life how much you care this Christmas with this unique partially used tub of hair wax as used by

1040
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:46,600
Guilford's very own star of the airwaves and so it goes on to describe it and

1041
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:53,320
Now I don't use hair wax, but then I realized that I had cleaned up

1042
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,520
The office and for some oops shoot

1043
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,640
What about thing just kick dashboard just kicked in I hope that didn't screw up the recording okay?

1044
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I realized that I cleaned up

1045
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,040
My you know the second bedroom the studio at the cottage and from some old television shoot

1046
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,360
Someone had brought along some hair gel and that had wound up in my little personal makeup bag and of course

1047
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,360
It was you know like old nasty hair gel so

1048
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,120
You know real creamy even I think I was it was really like totally wrong product to we toss that out

1049
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,040
And now all of a sudden some things are starting to fall in place for me

1050
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,240
Because I was here I was thinking that

1051
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,240
Well hold on let me read the second email and then you'll probably understand even more

1052
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,680
um

1053
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,840
So actually so this guy has been talking to Roger over Skype and

1054
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,880
Says Roger thinks you're more famous than Michael Jackson

1055
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,560
So I don't know about you oh

1056
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,000
Here he seems to open up to me in my girlfriend over Skype and he just said that he was at your house at

1057
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,160
230 this morning. I guess he's going through your trash and trying to sell your stuff. Well

1058
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:07,000
So he's getting this shit out of the trash. I thought it was the foxes who were who were rummaging through the trash

1059
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,960
That's pretty

1060
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,120
This is a little bizarre, man

1061
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,480
Roger don't come over to the house. Okay. I think

1062
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,320
Madge as email the couple times the Roger. I'm gonna get into this and find out what's going on

1063
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,920
This is just kidding a little bit too weird. Okay. I have one more pod save tune

1064
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,600
I want to play for it's really beautiful

1065
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:36,760
It's comes from a Russell Wolf who sent me emails says I'm a performing touring musician who also does max support for Harvard

1066
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,800
Emboston of course it makes total sense

1067
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,680
I listen to your podcast Friday you really reach me with the civility thing

1068
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,280
You were talking about human nature about being human

1069
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,240
Anyway, I've been loading a ton of my songs on the pod safe music network

1070
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,680
Including a song from a new album karma co called human

1071
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:04,120
I think you would really enjoy what it has to say about human frailty and the things we do to each other in love and war

1072
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Okay, Russell

1073
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Here's your spin man. Let's listen to human

1074
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:40,200
What do you see me looking at you?

1075
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,760
I must be

1076
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:51,400
Because I never looked that way and anyone else

1077
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,760
I

1078
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,440
Went out for some coffee

1079
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,880
We stopped in that restaurant

1080
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,960
I put on my best pair of shoes and my sweater

1081
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,120
Thought I could be what you want

1082
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:39,080
Sitting right up across from me

1083
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,760
It could have been you that I didn't see

1084
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,600
Because I never

1085
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,400
Real and noticed anyone else

1086
00:56:53,400 --> 00:57:04,520
In what else wouldn't hate the town would make you put you down

1087
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,320
Try the long way home

1088
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,760
Somebody else wouldn't hate you or pie and leave you

1089
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,760
Crying all alone

1090
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,960
So take off that makeup

1091
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,800
You're skin tries to speak to me

1092
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,320
You're wearing all of the paint like a horse and a doll

1093
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,320
It's a mystery

1094
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:47,080
Inside your eyes there relies a hole

1095
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,600
Into the scale 10 of your soul

1096
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,360
And there's only room for one

1097
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Not anyone else

1098
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,760
Not anyone else

1099
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,760
I

1100
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,880
Not anyone else

1101
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:55,200
I think we should just close out today's show with that, and just think about it.

1102
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:01,440
We all are human.
