1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It is source code episode 183. Guess what? We're still in Phoenix.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's a very short night at the lovely airport building.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We came back for the 710AM flight to San Francisco.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, we hung around and waited for that to be delayed until 8.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then they canceled basically every single flight they have.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So we once again have gone through the baggage resolution center to get our bags.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We actually have some meetings we really wanted to go to in San Francisco today.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So what we've opted for is to charter a plane, take us up the San Jose airport.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's one of those executive decisions to make once in a while.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, my bag has been returned to me and I'm standing back to the old familiar carousel number one,

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
waiting for wrongs bag. We've been waiting another half hour for that.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And he wants to go.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And I say shoot, you know, as long as we're chartering a plane, you might as well wait the extra 5-4 minutes

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to see if we can get his bag. So we made a gentleman's agreement.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When he gets back from the rest room, if the bag is not here, then we're just going to take off.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You'll see his bag eventually delivered hopefully.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So we're going to give you some sound seeing of that, I guess.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a 15 miles to Falcon Field, which is where the general aviation is located.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And we're going with the opportunity charter company.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me see if I can find, I think, wrongs and paperwork.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Nice guys though. Why the hook is up immediately?

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I knew what to ask for, which kind of helps.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And thank you all by the way for your encouraging emails that you sent.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I got a whole bunch saying, oh well, you know, made that decision never to fly with

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
America West ever again.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I would certainly advise the same.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And it's really not the people. It's a fucked up system.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And the employees seem to be just as frustrated.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I was in the restaurant myself just a moment ago.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Unfortunately, I wasn't recording. I should have heard the announcement.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, literally the America West announcers are saying, hey, we know this sucks we're sorry.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's pretty fucking fun.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we'll actually have a little bit of time to discuss the news that everyone's been talking about,

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
which is the presentation and Steve Jobs made yesterday in San Diego,

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the conference after we met with him.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But it's all good. It's all good.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The reason Steve wanted to meet with us is he wanted to make sure that they were doing things the right way.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I am very convinced they'd be able to call on a second kind of phone call here.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's wrong, hold on a second.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yo.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No, not yet.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, I'll call you if it comes off. Okay.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, so that was Ron saying that he's going to give them an address to send the bag to.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, man, this morning was so rough.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I got up at five o'clock after, as I said about four and a half hours sleep.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was so happy. I didn't wash my hair because the load dryer in the hotel was not working.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So I looked like shit to that.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But we're definitely going to make our meeting.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, that's good.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Instead of two hours by commercial air, it'll be three hours and 17 minutes.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We're flying.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think a set of four, 21, which is a turbo crop.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So it doesn't go as fast, obviously, as a turbo jet.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Although it does have turbine engines, it's just propellers instead of jet.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I would just say in a way.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So maximum cruising speed is probably about 359.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's about 300 miles an hour.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And just open here for another second.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So we found out, by the way, why my bag came off and his didn't because they don't actually look for it by bag.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a tag number.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They look for it by name on the tag.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We're looking for a second bag that had my name on it instead of the name bloom.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So learn something there for future reference.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Make sure that they're looking for your name on the bag.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because that's what they'll be looking for.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Not just the tag number, which is kind of similar.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Maybe they look at the name and then they provide a number.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Not looking, not looking too promising.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pause this throughout the trip.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Edit it back together before we upload it.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Later on tonight.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And stay tuned.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
For more exciting tales from the road with Adam and Ron.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Later.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, still here at the carousel.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Ron just walking back, so let's see what he has to say.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I guess we're going where that is bag.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We out?

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You sure?

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, okay.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know what?

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All of the stuff we just wanted to get this flying.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We're waiting around for a little piece of luggage.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not just a piece of luggage.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's your piece of luggage.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Sorry.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Thank you very much.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Off we go.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We need a safe.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You have a message waiting at the Beijing Assistant's location.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Boy.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It sounds familiar.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So what we're going to be are comes from NDR Station.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And from Conqueror, New York Magazine.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're going to train it's angle.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Good.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Good.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Good.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Good.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Good.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That is Falcon Field.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Airport.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Falcon Field.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I got the address actually.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's the line for young people.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
5133 East Roadrunner.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So you got to go to Falcon Drive and then roadrunner all the way down.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's in Mesa.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's Airport.

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Small Airport.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That sounded like a kind of thing.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Mesa Arizona?

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Mesa is a question.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Famous for what?

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thousands.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Here.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Mesa is like a big deal with it.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you have a family used to, I'm recording this by the way, Ron.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm just saying.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm taking a grab.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you have a family used to own all the flag stuff?

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A beer or the town?

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's the town.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And then, like some schmuck in my bathroom.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So did.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I got a hundred bucks.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's right.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I have some beans.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And a brew.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
All of flags that could have been ours.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You have a diplomacy in everyone.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I have to get there because he has a flymer at work.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How angry are you?

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He's appointed in our system.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think it should be a mandate.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think it should be a mandate.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So it's trying so desperately to save the airlines.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's going to behave like that.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Shut up down.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And let the new airline start.

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
People can compete based on customers.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know what the deal is.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
America or elsewhere.

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
No leadership from the top.

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No serious.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's what it is.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Who runs the air?

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Who runs it?

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And these people love who it is.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They don't have a feeling of adjusting the other company now.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The field's like just the system is messed up.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
They have a merger or they're afraid for their jobs.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They're taking quick and quick in.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Isn't it right?

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They don't want out of every 50, you know?

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Trying.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There's no.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What do you call it when you are?

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
When you help desk levels go up, escalation, process.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There's no escalation to seek you.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah.

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We'll check in that.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Right.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Going to our meeting.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Nothing else stops from spawning.

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh no.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Gas won't stop.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
All right.

192
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Check in for you in a bit.

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You got that?

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Here we are.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mace the Arizona.

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What does it ever really get hot?

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's the question.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not like 100 degrees.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Today's 110.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
110?

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So, around each area.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's what it is.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's what it is.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
90 to part.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
90 to part.

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
90 to part.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's nice.

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Thank you.

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah.

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Have a good one.

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Come in.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're open.

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Come on, man.

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sorry.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Mr. Bloom.

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hi.

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm just a flexible student.

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh, okay.

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah.

228
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How do you know?

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
How do you know?

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How do you know?

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay.

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you know what the likes do?

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If Dave is here?

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Dave would be in the office.

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, okay.

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Dave?

237
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes.

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, yeah.

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
On the rubble.

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We're all set.

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Good.

242
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Just a quick rest room stop.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Good to go.

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Great.

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay.

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You don't want to witness this.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll put you on hold.

248
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Watch your head.

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, so this is a.

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah.

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This is a little bit of a mine.

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Next size up for mine, right?

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It has the same basic kind of prophetic gear.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It kind of flaps in like that.

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Very easy.

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not easy.

258
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not easy.

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's not easy.

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's not easy.

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's not easy.

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Is that?

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah.

264
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's nice.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You got the external cooling unit coming away.

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah.

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's nice.

268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah.

269
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah.

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah.

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm going to go.

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going to go.

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm going to go.

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah.

289
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You're going to go.

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah.

291
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Go.

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't.

293
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Really.

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah.

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm going to go.

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.

297
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Back there.

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You can eat anything though.

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Nope.

300
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

301
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thanks.

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yep.

Yeah.

305
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah?

306
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That was pretty good, yep.

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll give you another standard break-y.

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The emergency satsets are this door here.

309
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah.

310
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There's plastic cover over this window.

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Hold this and push exit to the back.

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
See belts are normal buckle.

313
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's non-smoking flight.

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And you have water and there's a newspaper right back there.

315
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Six acts that you need them.

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's just not it.

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay, okay.

318
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This concludes your standard.

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You know what we're talking about?

320
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Barbie.

321
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, I know what you're just going to fly around.

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000

Yeah.

326
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And we talked about a car service and we got there again.

327
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

328
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hold that though.

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That is guys a pros.

330
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why not just keep that big trap shed now.

331
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No, that's good.

332
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, we're going to the STC.

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Beautiful.

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000

335
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, she's looking here.

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000

I'm happy we're going.

To be at that Fakaka airport for another three hours before we ever leave.

340
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Where are we left?

341

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah.

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

380
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

381
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

382
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah.

384
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah.

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah.

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah.

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah.

389
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

390
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

391
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah.

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah.

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah.

395
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

396
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah.

397
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah.

398
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

399
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah.

402
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah.

403
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah.

404
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah.

405
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah.

406
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah.

407
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah.

408
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No.

409
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
All right.

410
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah.

411
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah.

412
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah.

413
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Here we go.

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Here we go.

415
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Here we go.

416
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Here we go.

417
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Now we need to take a picture.

418
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll go perfectly with this mini-samsi one tour because you'll never believe the clay bar in.

419
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This beautiful man.

420
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This is what aviation is all about, dude.

421
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm going to take a picture of me talking to you.

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Can you see if that work?

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think it's not going to look at you, but it's back to the airport.

424
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You can walk in a little bit.

425
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's 20% there.

426
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm heading to get a mile on the other hand.

427
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know.

428
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We've got our mini-samsi.

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's going to be pretty boring from here on in.

430
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So we wrap up the rest of the day after our meeting.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's going to be an interesting event that takes place during the flight for the next three hours.

432
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's sit back and enjoy the ride.

433
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Don't you later.
