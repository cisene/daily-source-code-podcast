00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Daily source code from Monday may 9th 2005.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,080
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,160
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who managed what you can hear since

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,920
radio is invented.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,280
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:27,400
With $60 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,720
content in my ears.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,160
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,040
Hi, this is Rachel from audiocollective.net.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,040
You're listening to Adam Curry on the Daily Source code.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,360
Everybody it is Monday the 9th of May 2005.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,880
Oh yeah, brand new setup couldn't resist over the weekend, been playing around with

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:05,400
all kinds of different stuff and yeah, low and behold we have lift off, got new software

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
that I'm trying out.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,480
It's running across two computers and so far I'm pretty happy.

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,720
There's of course as you can see I'm doing my nails at the same time I'm doing this

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
podcast.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,640
Hey, I hope you had a great mother's day if you're a mom or if you're a son or a daughter.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,360
Hope you called your favorite mom.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,600
We'll be talking about that today on the show.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Of course, hot-save music on the way, got a mash up lined up for you, plenty of promos

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,440
and some news from around, just around you know, stuff that I've been doing.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,440
I'm actually standing up doing the show today which is news.

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,840
The setup doesn't fit in the green thing.

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,720
Yesterday, Patricia and I did a podcast together.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,880
We hijacked a daily source code feed so I apologize in advance.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,440
I apologize in hindsight.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,920
I think I did apologize in advance actually that it was a complete Dutch language podcast.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,480
It was something we talked about doing actually about a week and a half ago what I was

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
in the States.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,760
There's so many gossip magazines writing so much crap about us.

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,720
I said, you know, why don't we do a podcast and we'll just talk amongst ourselves, you know,

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
the real truth.

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:34,280
You know, just us, you and me baby, turned out great, response has been phenomenal, obviously

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,960
only from the Dutch market, but yeah, really, really even enjoyed doing that.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,600
It's, you know, it's almost like our own little Don and Drew show, you know, I totally

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
dig it.

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,280
So let me tell you what I have set up here.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,640
Of course, I have the regular microphone and the processing, oh man, Patricia hates it when

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,680
I talk geek stuff about the setup, but I'm using this new piece of software, which I think

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,240
I've mentioned before, it's called Megaseg.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,720
Megaseg is essentially it's a scheduling software.

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,680
They just released version 3.1.

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,160
It's for Mac only for OSX only, I think, even.

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,400
But it's really stable and what I've done is I've loaded up all promos, mashups, pod safe,

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,680
music, sweepers, jingles, imaging stuff, you know, everything you need for, well, that I like

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,320
to have for my podcast.

48
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,920
And then you line it up into playlists and what it does is it does all the transitions

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,800
for you automatically unless you insert a break.

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,680
So it really leaves, you know, a lot of, it kind of, it's kind of analogous to, to flying,

51
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,680
you know, if you can, if you can lower the pilot load, that's all, it's all like pilot

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
workload.

53
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,400
It's always a good thing because you probably have a safer landing.

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,040
So that's running into the mixer than I'm mixing in my microphone.

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,240
I'm actually outputting the entire signal to my other Mac and I'm running audio hijack

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,560
pro, which also has a new version out.

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,840
So yeah, we may be doing a lot of work on the 97% of Windows users out there with the

58
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,440
cast blaster, but the Mac, although it's all disparate pieces of software that definitely

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,880
is a lot of stuff you can do.

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,440
So hopefully this will sound okay, normally what I do is I, you know, I record it reasonably

61
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,480
high bit rate and then use the lame brain or the lame libraries, whatever it's called

62
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,120
to compress, you know, to compress it down to 64 kilobit rate or whatever I usually do.

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,640
So now I'm using a built in just the, what is it?

64
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,880
It's the low MP3 encoding 64 kilobit per second stereo continuous bit rate.

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,920
So hopefully hopefully it'll, it'll sound okay, if not, while you just have to forgive

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
me.

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,200
Let's see, oh, the beginning of the show, that was Peter Day from the BBC.

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,880
I'll put a link to this in the show notes.

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,040
There was an hour long special last night on Radio 4, which is the, it's pretty much

70
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
a talk channel.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,160
It's the, you know, it's where everyone tuned in to listen to the elections here.

72
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,880
It's, yeah, it's the, it's the, it's the talk channel, basically.

73
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,200
And a full hour on podcasting and it's just wonderful.

74
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,880
I don't know how long the show is going to stay up.

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,720
Of course, I recorded an MP3, but you know, I've already emailed the producer and said,

76
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,480
hey, any chance of you turning this show about podcasting into a podcast, I haven't heard

77
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
back from her yet.

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,920
So in case it does go away, I'll have a, I'll have a backup link.

79
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Okay, let me see if I'm doing all this right now.

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,560
Hold on, now I thought, I thought we're going to have a mashup play right now.

81
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,360
Let me see if it works.

82
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Shoot.

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Hold on.

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
I didn't work.

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
What did I do wrong here?

86
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Hold on.

87
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Bear with me now, please.

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
What's it going to do wrong?

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Oh, shoot.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,160
Okay, this is interesting.

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,760
What's happened is, oh, wow.

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:56,360
Okay, so this mega SEG, it has a whole database that you can set up, so that it basically

93
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,400
keeps track of what you've played and when you've played it.

94
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,960
And if it, if it encounters something that you've set up a rule for, so for instance,

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,480
I said, you know, anything that I play in the, in the mashup category, don't play it

96
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,040
for at least, you know, at least a month because I don't want to repeat myself.

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,880
And I'd already done, oh man, everything's happening at the same time, is that Christina

98
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
coming home to?

99
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Hold on.

100
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
I'll be just checked.

101
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,760
She, not, okay.

102
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:40,360
So what mega SEG then did, which was correct, is it went ahead and changed the, you know,

103
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,040
what, let me just do this for a second.

104
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,760
Maybe if I can just open up the playlist again, I'm sorry to put you through this, but

105
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,200
it's definitely, okay, let me see, okay, this will work.

106
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Oh, thank goodness.

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,960
All right, so I've turned off the rules because it was replacing stuff that I'd

108
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
played.

109
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,120
You know, before I started recording, I basically auditioned it and to see if everything

110
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
was working well.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,520
But then it countered each audition as a play in essence, replacing all the songs.

112
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Okay, here we go.

113
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
This is Golden Peace Frog.

114
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
This is my great pleasure.

115
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Reset to you.

116
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
That's shit, son.

117
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
You're the no-goo.

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Never seen it.

119
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
See your fear.

120
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Check it out now.

121
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
I've worked a pandemic to ain't transformed.

122
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,520
You need to take a list of it's depends on that year.

123
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
It's hands on.

124
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
What's the beat?

125
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
The goal is high, goal cheats.

126
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
I'll protect you.

127
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
I'll drink, all the way to glass.

128
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Get your shame.

129
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
They'll treat the same place.

130
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
All the fans depend.

131
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
The design for heaven, nationality.

132
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
And wrapping the legend with their limits.

133
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
That is so much play, but it's all the matter.

134
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
We're not all in.

135
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
We take it back to the days of that show.

136
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,520
We hold in on to us, go in.

137
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
I'm gonna say it's not right to know who it is.

138
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
We're not all in.

139
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Because I call it in.

140
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
We take it back to the days of that show.

141
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
And hold in on to us, go in.

142
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm gonna drink, all the way to know who it is.

143
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Never call it one day.

144
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
So take the hot thing.

145
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Big breaks that chase at all.

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
That's for the same.

147
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
No name.

148
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
You stay true to the fans.

149
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Stay true to the game.

150
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
And never bring it to shame.

151
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
We take the 12 blocks.

152
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
We wrap up.

153
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
We're not all in.

154
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
We take it back to the days of that show.

155
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
We hold in on to us, go in.

156
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
We take it back to the days of that show.

157
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
We hold in on to us, go in.

158
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
We take it back to the day of that show.

159
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
We hold in on to us, go in.

160
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
We take it back to the day of that show.

161
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
We hold in on to us, go in.

162
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
We take it back to the day of that show.

163
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
We hold in on to us, go in.

164
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
We take it back to the day of that show.

165
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
We hold in on to us, go in.

166
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
We take it back to the day of that show.

167
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
We hold in on to us, go in.

168
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520

John Mahal.

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
So it had been there for last year or two.

225
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Wait.

226
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
So I can't go right into the show.

227
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
The show yesterday.

228
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Come on guys, let's go in through through the show.

229
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:24,680
open it up. Let me see, when we talk about, oh, what do you want us to do? I'm going

230
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,920
to take a screenshot. I think I can take a screenshot of this. Can't I hold on a second?

231
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,080
Let's see if this works. Yeah. Oh, man. I love the way that does that. Okay. So we've

232
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,520
got a screenshot. I'll post that along with the show notes. So you can see kind of what

233
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,920
I mean with the software. I'm pretty jazzed about it because you can have all the stuff

234
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,080
transition automatically and then you can put a break in wherever you feel appropriate and

235
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,680
the playlist will stop until you hit the Apple key forward slash and then it hits the next thing.

236

Daily source code. That wasn't even there, Christina. That was the window washers.

260
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,400
Just never know what goes on. Mom's are important when they're around. They get a lot of

261
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:46,200
shit done in the house. Unfortunately, the next problem that I'm going to play is late, but I didn't

262
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,280
want to, you know, I didn't want to hold back on. I just didn't even see it in the promo inbox and

263
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:59,720
didn't actually realize that it was was timely from Rev Tim. And that'll be followed by some feedback

264
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,360
from arthritis central news. And then I want to talk about my own mother's mother's mother's

265
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,320
name. Hi, this is Rev Tim from the Rev Tim podcast. I've a special request. I'm putting out

266
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,880
to the podcast listener community. I'm putting together a special mother's day podcast to be

267
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,960
released Friday evening. Sorry. So what I need you to do is to call our voicemail comment line

268
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:31,560
at 815 301-8600. And leave a message that describes what it is about your mother that makes

269
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:38,440
her special to you. Okay. I just want to stop that for a second. I'm really sorry, Rev Tim. I mean,

270
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,760
you know, you got to shoot me a personal email. They went into the promo box and I just never saw

271
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:49,800
a man. I apologize. And you could also share a special memory or just leave a message to your mom.

272
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,240
So give it a shot right now. It won't use up much of your time. And I'm sure it will make this

273
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,480
podcast very special. So the number again, it's not told free. So use yourself. If you need to,

274
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:12,440
it's 815 301-8600. Thank you from Rev Tim and the Rev Tim podcast. Hey, Adam, it's Dr. Joel Ritzkin,

275
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,520
and our thread is central.com. I really appreciate you playing our promo on your own podcast.

276
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,360
It's interesting that you commented about the marijuana and how that might be helpful to co-paying

277
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,800
a study. It was published just two years ago in the Dr. Illinois American Medical Association,

278
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,440
addressed the use of one of the derivatives of marijuana called CT3. And it was used to control

279
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:43,320
severe nerve pain in patients. And it worked. Patients on this marijuana-like drug did better than

280
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,760
those without it. The side effects were gizziness, sweating, fatigue, dryness of the mouth,

281
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,800
and even problems concentrating. So the question is, will this be something that can be used to

282
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:01,240
control other forms of pain, including arthritis, fibromyalgia? Now, in your case, your own marijuana

283
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,560
use it. You might not even feel it if a truck was on top of your chest. So it really depends on

284
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,640
how much you're using, but it looks like it might be something promising in the future as far as

285
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,960
marijuana derivatives in rheumatic diseases. So I know you were kind of joking about it, but it may

286
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:26,280
actually be real and you're right. And the idea is to control pain and give people some quality of life.

287
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,920
We'll continue to follow this that are throughout the central.com. We'll try to keep you informed

288
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,760
down the road if there are any new developments in this area. I'm sure it's something you're interested

289
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,440
in. And your listeners may be interested in it as well. You take care and appreciate your

290
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,600
help and support. You're doing a great job. Thanks again. All right. Thank you very much, Dr. Joel,

291
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,720
from the arthritis news and views podcast. So I just want to touch back on that again and my

292
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,840
apologies to Rev Tim that I messed that one up. But what was interesting is now, if you've been

293
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,000
listening to the daily source code for a while, then you know that last year, just actually between

294
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,840
Christmas and New Year's, my mom had a lung removed. She had lung cancer and she is now officially

295
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,120
a survivor. In fact, they sent her home, you know, after 10 days and said, don't come back for a month

296
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,760
and then they said, don't come back after two months. And so it's been about four or let's see the five

297
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,480
months now. And of course, it has altered not only her, but everyone's life in the family.

298
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,360
She does have a lot of pain from, well, this basically, this huge incision that they, you know,

299
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,720
they cut her open all the way from her back around to the the front of her chest. And it's been

300
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,840
buggerner, as you can imagine. You know, it's like, as she tried to explain it to me, I can hardly

301
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,000
imagine what that, you know, what the pain must be like. I think the fact that it's just constant

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,400
and there is probably what drives you crazy, kind of like an itch that you just can't scratch.

303
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,880
You know, you can't get to only like way more fucked up. And so, and I kept saying, I said, Mom,

304
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,320
you know, try some marijuana. You know, of course, she wouldn't be smoking it, but she would be

305
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,640
perhaps putting it into some food or drinking it as tea. And she called me last week and she said,

306
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,760
all right, I'm ready. I'll try anything. So I called up my, well, taxi Eric, of course,

307
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,560
called him up, had him make a little delivery in, come on, my mom lives in, in the Netherlands.

308
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:28,040
And, and first she, she'd found all kinds of recipes on the internet for, like, soup and some other,

309
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:35,400
yeah, liquid food or whatever. And, and she used up about five grams and said, I don't feel

310
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,400
anything. It's not working. He said, well, I don't believe in all this soup shit. So just make some tea,

311
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,200
you know, just boil up some water, boil it with with a nice bud in there, then make yourself

312
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,840
for like half a cup of nice fruit tea or something that'll taste good, a little sugar, and then just

313
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,680
strain in this, this boiled water with, you know, with cannabis and it's strain that into your tea.

314
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,080
And, and that should work. And she called me last night, Sunday night, and she was laughing.

315
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,840
It was so funny. She said, like, I don't know if, if I'm stone, but the pain is certain,

316
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm going to hit the pain. That's like going off. The pain is certainly, it's almost gone.

317
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,360
And I haven't heard from her today as she was going to call me, but she said that she was feeling

318
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:24,120
great and the pain was completely gone. And I'd say we had a very, very, very successful experiment

319
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,280
there, and it was good to hear from Dr. Joel. Hey, I'm not all that bad. You know, it's, yeah,

320
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,280
maybe a mini van. I wouldn't feel it, but a truck. Yeah, I probably feel there.

321
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:53,880
I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.

322
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:03,880
I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.

323
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:21,880
I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.

324
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,480
I love it. I love it. It's love. I've done the next wax flat. I really had a heart attack

325
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,780
Like me, but meant to somebody sucks me

326
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,480
Such a mother, got to find a love

327
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Got to find a love, got to find a love

328
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,480
After all now

329
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
I'm out in the throne of mine

330
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
We know they're gone

331
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,480
I don't think I had was gone

332
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
After all now

333
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
I'm out in the throne of mine

334
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,480
That's love, it's love, it's love, it's love

335
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,480
It's love, it's love, it's love

336
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
It's love

337
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:41,480
It's love, it's love, it's love

338
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
After all now

339
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I'm out in the throne of mine

340
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
It's love, it's love, it's love

341
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,480
I don't think I had was gone

342
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
After all now

343
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,480
I'm out in the throne of mine

344
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,480
It's love, it's love, it's love

345
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,480
It's love, it's love

346
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,480
It's love, it's love

347
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
It's love, it's love

348
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,480
It's love, it's love

349
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,480
It's love, it's love

350
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,480
It's love, it's love

351
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,480
It's love, it's love

352
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
It's love, it's love

353
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,480
It's love, it's love

354
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
You're in backstacking

355
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
It's love

356
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
It's love, it's love

357
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
It's love, it's love

358
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,480
It's love, it's love

359
00:22:50,480 --> 00:23:05,480
I want to go to Paris.

360
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Stay at the hill tonight.

361
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,480
No kiss.

362
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,480
For Paris, no phone.

363
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,480
So, Paris comes clean.

364
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,480
You are one station.

365
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,480
You come clean.

366
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,480
You just let the rest of us your love.

367
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,480
You can let us win the last one star.

368
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,480
You love Paris with the last win.

369
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,480
You can let me know as well.

370
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
So, Paris,

371
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,480
forget your millions go and just come clean.

372
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:03,480
You can let us pass your love with much of one star.

373
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:21,480
That came through on openpodcast.org.

374
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Excellent promo for Mad Weinstein, useradio.com.

375
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Okay, I just noticed that in my new software set up, I had Skype still open.

376
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,480
So, I think you heard the phone ring throughout the pod safe tune there.

377
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,480
I apologize for that.

378
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
I got to work on this stuff.

379
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,480
And do two more tests since we're messing around with software and recording stuff.

380
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,480
I'll also do two things.

381
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,480
One is I'm going to throw this show up on the pod show server instead of the dot max server.

382
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Since it'll be a little bit shorter than normal, I can be 30 minutes, I guess.

383
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,480
And see if our bandwidth can handle it.

384
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,480
So, you know, if you didn't hear the show, sorry.

385
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,480
And I'm also working, that since I've been talking about Bitcoin as a bandwidth solution,

386
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,480
a lot of people have been sending me emails, setting up stuff.

387
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,480
So, I'm going to try and put up not this show, but what I was thinking,

388
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,480
PW and I are creating basically working throughout this entire week to get ready for the pod show,

389
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,480
launch on serious on Friday the 13th is coming Friday.

390
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,480
And what we'll do is, once we get all the sweepers and all the stuff in which is being created as we speak,

391
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,480
we have one out, one or two hours all put together.

392
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Then I'll put those up as a torrent.

393
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,480
So, A, you can see if it'll download into your iPodder through a through a bit torrent,

394
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
which it should.

395
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,480
And B, you'll have an idea of what we're actually planning.

396
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
By your house, radio.

397
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,480

405
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:28,480
The motitude's went forth and cast their pods in the direction of all who would listen.

406
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,480
And casting their pods in this manner, they were henceforth known as pod castors.

407
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Yes, you can get in your ear.

408
