00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Hey everybody, this is Adam coming to you with the daily source code for Tuesday, March

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:16,400
8th, 2005 from the restaurant area at Skiple Airport in Amsterdam, which is outside of Amsterdam.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Got myself some McDonald's, I looked at the healthy stuff like the walk place, but it looks

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:35,000
shitty. It's 820 PM, and oh man, today has been ups and downs, rollercoaster all the way

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,800
in all aspects, by the way the sound quality is because I'm doing this on the iRiver recording

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,000
on its internal microphone, so whenever I basically move my hand on the casing it creaks

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,640
and scratches, but in general the quality is not bad, I found, so where to start off, today

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,720
was supposed to be a flying day, and literally flying day, getting up really early, 415 to catch

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,760
easy jet to Amsterdam, where taxi Eric was waiting to drive me to Antwerp about an hour and a half,

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,720
to do some serious flight training with Wing Commander William, and when you're crazy about

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,880
flying like I am, and you got one of the best in the business to train you, you'll do almost anything,

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,760
and of course, driving back up after that, and taking the 955 flight home, which gets me

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:33,880
in almost exactly the same time, 10.05 since we gain an hour, flying back in time from Amsterdam to London.

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,320
So, I recorded some bits in the car, and I was going to do a much longer recording in podcast

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,400
on the way back, but I'll get to that in a second, why that didn't happen. But the easy jet flight

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:57,000
was actually great this morning, left on time, 7, 6, 25, got in on time, and we were able to land

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,480
on not the fifth runway, which is the one that's like 15 minute taxi ride away from the terminal,

18
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,360
and literally the plane has to taxi for 15 minutes, so we about 10 minutes early, taxi Eric wasn't

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,800
even here yet, so it waited for like 5 minutes, he showed up, and then we started to drive down,

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,800
and as I promised him, I brought along my iPod with the I-trip and his favorite podcast,

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,040
Rock and Roll Geek Show, so here's a bit of our ride down to the airport.

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,960
Okay, we're in the car right now with taxi Eric on a way to Antwerp, this thing is in Rock and Roll Geek!

23
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,920
Hey, how are you doing, buddy? I'm very good thank you very much. So we're off for some flying lessons today.

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,440
I'll crank it up Eric, let's listen to Rock and Roll Geek Show, Mark's got the I-trip cranking

25
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:52,040
wild parts, the theme song is Cheers, nice to opening down for there, thanks a lot for joining me, I really appreciate it.

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,720
So I'll be checking in a little bit later on, right?

27
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Oh, and this is a here, really pretty unbelievable, we're sitting here listening to Michael Butler,

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,360
trying to think of Cheers.

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,920
All you think is, I'm just showing them his trio with your GPS, and it actually seems like he's working.

30
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,960
You can't listen to that person anymore, you are, and we'll give you driving directions,

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,720
and it tells you how fast you're going in the car, what do you think about that?

32
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,880
Oh my god, that's amazing!

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,280
He is so nice!

34
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
Oh, thank you, man.

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,280
All right, have it.

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,360
Like I said, chicks dig guys with GPS equipment.

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,920
So, and speaking of GPS, so I, oh no, I give a positive review to the

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,440
map-opolis navigator GPS for the trio 600.

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,440
I'll put a link to Michael Butler, you know what I mean?

40
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,160
Okay, well you guys were listening to that, I polished off one of the two burgers I bought,

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,960
from Mickey D, and I got my large fries here, and, you know, they don't give you free ketchup,

42
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,680
or as they like to sell here, the free sauce, which is the French fries sauce,

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,960
pay for that extra, a little, a little bucket.

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,440
I remember the first coming to Holland, see people eat French fries with mayonnaise, and it really

45
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,600
grossed me out, because you know, that's you eat that with ketchup, right?

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Kits up.

47
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,840
Well, I'll tell you what you get used to it that for a while.

48
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,680
I'll actually start to like it.

49
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,920
I'll go on to something here to use Dutch guys.

50
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,200
So, we got to the airport, Antwerp Airport, which is where the wing commander has his hangar

51
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,720
in his operation, and we went up to the back gate, and Nick, who you know, because I've

52
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,400
flown with Nick before, came up to the gate and said, you know, we actually, the gate won't

53
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,000
open, because they just called a strike, so here I am, I've been traveling for a couple hours,

54
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,120
to do some flight training, I'm really psyched, and now the fucking airport sounds strike.

55
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,120
And actually, that was the last recording I made of the day on the spot.

56
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,840
So, here's us discovering the strike, and Nick trying to smuggle us into the airport,

57
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
and not succeeding.

58
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,960
So, we're at the Antwerp Airport, and I can't move the foot, I can't move the foot.

59
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
And guess what, there's a strike here.

60
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,360
So, we can't get onto the field itself, this is a, this is a relatively small airport.

61
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
There's only one airline that flies in on it here.

62
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,560
V11, the Flam-Soulet-Fartmaster Bay, which flies from Antwerp to London City.

63
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,280
Not really convenient for me to land here today, because London City is a real long haul from

64
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,080
our house, whereas Gatwick and Heathrow are pretty close.

65
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,240
So, we're now in the main hall, and there's a whole bunch of striking workers, and it's only an hour

66
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,520
long strike, so let me be done in about 20 minutes. Nick came out to pick us up, I remember Nick

67
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,360
flew the mooney with him. Oh well, it was months ago.

68
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,520
And so, now we just see if we can get onto the field before the strike is over, if we actually have to wait

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,760
until everyone's back at their posts for them to let us on.

70
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,080
It's shitty, it's shitty, yeah, it's especially after, you know, the day started for the death.

71
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,600
Yeah, I got up at what time, I got up at like four or fifteen this morning.

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,640
Yeah, I used half-fosh five, and it started for the death, and then we started very bad.

73
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,320
Oh, I'm mooney, I'm a white Brazil.

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,320
Oh, that's your life.

75
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,040
You had a big flu.

76
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,120
Okay, yeah, I'll pretend I got out.

77
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,080
My daughter had a tooth.

78
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,440
I don't want to end the tooth at there, you know?

79
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:34,600
Yeah.

80
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,800
And I'm, uh, be had this wonderful ride all the way.

81
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

82
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,240
I really cleared up with the rock road.

83
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,880
Each year.

84
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,160
Yeah, how did I start this?

85
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,320
I started smiling and then I did, yeah, you know, and I defrost.

86
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,600
Yeah, totally defrost, and then I come in and I'm fucking pissed over again.

87
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,400
Okay, well, that's all right.

88
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,280
Of course, we can do a fly.

89
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,160
Yeah, we're gonna fly.

90
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm gonna fly.

91
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,080
What's the deal?

92
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,120
Yeah.

93
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna fly.

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,920
Okay.

95
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,080
And all the way, if we come, we'll jump to the next.

96
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,880
Is it a restaurant?

97
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,920
No, it is.

98
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,880
Yeah.

99
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Yeah.

100
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Yeah, we're gonna back.

101
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Yeah, we're gonna back.

102
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
See if you want me to go to the next one.

103
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Okay.

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
It's good, Nick.

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Thank you.

106
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
Okay, it's a Nick person.

107
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
I have a comeback.

108
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,720
Man, this guy's gonna sell me an airplane.

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
They will be back.

110
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
They will be back.

111
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,080
Boys in the desto restaurant.

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,720
Yeah, they will be in the same spot.

113
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Three.

114
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Yeah.

115
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Well, this is kind of interesting.

116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,960
Interesting start of my training lesson for today.

117
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,680
A training in human relations.

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Okay.

119
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:42,760
Now we're going into the training a little something to work here.

120
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,360
I'll have a cup of tea now actually.

121
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Yeah.

122
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
You can go.

123
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Okay.

124
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,220
Can be closed, man.

125
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,260
Okay, let me introduce more.

126
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,760
Well, haven't you seen my interview?

127
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,140
I once related the intro of this video.

128
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,640
Um...

129
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
... right...

130
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
When you went to our club?

131
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
What do you usually love?

132
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,760
Yeah.

133
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,200
You would like here?

134
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,820
It's a competition in Boston.

135
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,520
What?

136
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,320
Yes.

137
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Thanks.

138
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,660
Good start.

139
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,140
Good spot!

140
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:53,660
Okay.

141
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,660
And I do another audio check.

142
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,660
See how that came out.

143
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,660
See how that came out.

144
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,660
So it didn't sound too bad.

145
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
It's a high river.

146
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:18,660
It's amazing to me every single time.

147
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,660
So needless to say,

148
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
we got in.

149
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,660
The weather wasn't great, but it was actually more than good enough.

150
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,660
And kind of cool to have a little bit of wind and turbulence to work with.

151
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
My touch-and-goes.

152
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,660
And we did some pretty extreme flying for a bit.

153
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
William took the wheel.

154
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Then it shows me how the Cessna 182RG, which stands for a tractable gear.

155
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,660
Fly is just like a fighter plane.

156
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,660
And poor taxi Eric was in the back getting greener and greener.

157
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,660
And then we'd ask him like, you know,

158
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,660
you got big shoes, man, because you might need to use it.

159
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,660
But he was okay.

160
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,660
He, Eric has been on the helicopter.

161
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,660
He went to the, excuse me, burger.

162
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,660
He worked on the oil rigs in the North Sea for seven years.

163
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,660
And so that's like, you know, two weeks on one week off.

164
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,660
And you're always transported by big helicopters.

165
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,660
So he's had even had some water crash training.

166
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
So he was okay.

167
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,660
But still, when you're doing touching-goes,

168
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,660
it can make you pretty crazy in the back.

169
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
But we did that for like two hours.

170
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
It was great.

171
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Wonderful plane.

172
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,660
Really really really like that machine.

173
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,660
Fast too, man.

174
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,660
Like a hundred and the cruising speed, about 150 knots.

175
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,660
You know, you can go up to,

176
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
this thing can really move.

177
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,660
It can do like 170, 170 miles an hour.

178
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,660
So really quite quite a nice machine.

179
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
Of course, the gear retracts.

180
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,660
So it's, that's where it gets some of the better aerodynamics from.

181
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
It's definitely a machine I'm looking at.

182
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
So I got really excited.

183
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,660
You know, we're kicking the tires around the hanger.

184
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,660
And it was two crappy after a while when we got back to take a helicopter out.

185
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Well, certain do that another time.

186
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
And then I got a phone call.

187
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,660
You know, so first we had the roller coasters in the air.

188
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,660
The ups and the downs.

189
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,660
And I got a phone call that a legal proceeding that I've been

190
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
up to up in for like two and a half years.

191
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
Finally is being settled.

192
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,660
And I'm getting almost everything that I obviously deserved

193
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
about two thirds.

194
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,660
So in a settlement, you got to give a little bit right.

195
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,660
But it was just getting crazy.

196
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Two and a half years worth of crap.

197
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,660
So I was very happy about that.

198
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
And all men with planes started looking more attractive to me.

199
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
I tell you.

200
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,660
I was like, you know, what would it be like to own one?

201
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,660
And so, you know, we had some coffee, hung out,

202
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
and you just talked to a guy stuff, right?

203
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Which I really should have recorded.

204
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,660
I apologize.

205
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
But I was kind of sucked up into the moment.

206
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,660
And hop in the car to drive back to Amsterdam to the airport

207
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
and my phone rings.

208
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,660
And it's a whole other proceeding that just, you know,

209
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
these things like the courts here, it's crazy.

210
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
But I don't even want to go into it.

211
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,660
So it's like, you know, where one door opens,

212
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
another door closes, or one door closes,

213
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
another door opens.

214
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
That's definitely what happened today, man.

215
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,660
Just continuously.

216
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
So close the door on one proceeding,

217
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
and open the door on another,

218
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,660
which was not a good door necessarily to open.

219
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,660
And I'm just trying to cut loose from this country.

220
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
And I just want to get all my assets out

221
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,660
and just be freeing clear everybody and be done with it all.

222
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,660
And just when I think I'm out,

223
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,660
they pull me back in.

224
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Well, that was a shitty impression.

225
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,660
So I spent most of the ride back on the phone with lawyers

226
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,660
until about, not just about three quarters of the way.

227
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,660
And then I actually got another boost of a call.

228
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,660
We've, I've finalized some important agreements

229
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,660
and stuff, which is called stuff for now,

230
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,660
for a new company that I am co-founder of.

231
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,660
And I'm really excited.

232
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,660
So this is where another huge, like,

233
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,660
they loading doors opened up for me today.

234
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,660
And now, don't think that, oh, you know,

235
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,660
this is Adam's podcasting company,

236
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,660
because it is going to be a part of a podcast

237
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,660
and that is, will be a part of a much larger idea.

238
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,660
I think is extremely exciting.

239
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,660
I'm going to be talking about it in the next weeks.

240
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Maybe even days, talking more about what I see coming

241
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
and where we're going.

242
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,660
And podcasting is a big part of what's coming.

243
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
It's probably just the tip of the spear.

244
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,660
And it's taken quite a while to figure out

245
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,660
where I might want to fit into all of this.

246
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,660
And I think I've done them on to something.

247
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,660
So what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to presume now

248
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,660
that my flight back is going to be uneventful

249
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
and everything else would be fine

250
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,660
and that there are no more doors opening and closing today.

251
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,660
And tomorrow I will be back with you from the cottage

252
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
with a full source code.

253
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,660
When you've been saving lots of bits over the past two days.

254
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
Of course, we had the Patricia Pi Podcast,

255
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,660
so I kind of left that run from Sunday over to Monday.

256
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
And tomorrow, we know, first day,

257
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,660
really back behind the mic with a full outliner stacked

258
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,660
with clips and stuff to talk about.

259
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,660
And who knows what else we'll be mentioning tomorrow.

260
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Now remember, all of you are under the no-dam announcements rule, right?

261
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
All right.

262
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,660
So in closing, I'd just like to say,

263
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,660
that isn't an amazing, but I'm sitting here in airport.

264
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,660
They're the McDonald's talking into a piece of plastic,

265
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,660
which is being broadcast to all of you.

266
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,660
Elroy Jetson signing off.
