The next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Everybody how you doing it is Monday it's June 13, 2005

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I know I know you were waiting for a show on Friday

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I really apologize, I just I didn't have it in

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's it and that of course is the beauty of podcasting

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a craft you'll get it when I did it when you got it got it get it

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, it's the start of a new week

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How many of you from Curry Castle in the lovely affluent suburb built up

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's in Surrey in the UK where the weather is absolutely beautiful today

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So little on the it's like called on the nippy side actually

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The wind is shifted it's now coming from the

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's from the southwest which means it's blowing right into the studio windows

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Which are always open for smoke relief

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You know what I mean

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It got a pretty cool shine show lined up for you lots of freaky stuff

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Also apologies to the Dutch listeners who were perhaps expecting a Patricia Adam podcast

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This week and we really just didn't get around to it we slept a lot

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We hung out a lot we went shopping in fact right after this show

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going shopping again because

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I kind of came to the realization that I haven't purchased new clothes in three years

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think it was actually Ron's wife Marta who really got me back on the on the buying trip

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She says something very prolific to me

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She said hey, you know with the pants you ring it looks like you have no ass

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, how many good looking women you need to say that to you before you decided to do something about it

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All right, we got some cool stuff to talk about and of course pod save music on the way plenty of promos and

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Scorching mashups

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Drop it like it's a whole lot you're going to love this party Ben getting stupid with lead's new plan

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's see

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The one that pimps in the crib must drop it like it's how I drop it like it's how I drop it like it's how I drop it like it's how

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,560
The extra to get it you pocket like it's how I pocket like it's how I pocket like it's how I

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Get it to pop it like it's how I pop it like it's how I pop it like it's how I got to roll you

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Only a moment when shot down and I'll go best because I got it when I'm a nice team

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm a nice kid and see these ice cubes and see these ice creams

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No people that you're not a boat that's quite it and what's going on you throw the fan

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You should think about it take a second matter of fact you should say for me and think before you full those

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Stay for me when the kids in the crib must drop it like it's how I drop it like it's how I drop it like it's how

Try to get it you keep on getting like this how I get I'm a nice team

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Come on, it's like a song, get ahead of two, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song, I've been like a song,

I can't be cool, you can't

54
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,520
Party, Ben, getting stupid indeed

55
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Drop it like it's hard, droffed like it's

56
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,920
Man, as what does that in mix of Snoop Dog and

57
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,860
Well, blah blah, blah blah

58
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,880
that's funny because I was actually thinking about that song

59
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,700
I don't know what it was, over the weekend I was thinking about

60
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
Led Zeppelin, I don't know why I just the song was in my head, and then all of a sudden this morning, I'm

61
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,560
the show and that shows up. I love it. And if you thought, oh man, there's this quick time

62
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,920
problem again because it dropped out. No, this show is actually being produced in its entirety

63
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,640
on cast blaster beta number 15. Now the sound of course of the microphone is going to be pretty good

64
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,960
because I did route my regular microphone through it, but I'm just using the little craplet

65
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,960
with the cast blaster right up there. I'm using the combination of the the mouse and the

66
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,280
pen actually to kick stuff off to start to start the bits. We did a lot of testing over the week

67
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:13,600
and cast blaster mic. Lead developer was working on actually discovering how to create a compressor

68
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,200
limiter and most of the stuff these days you know of course I still use the stereo valve process

69
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,000
which is done with old well old fashioned radio tubes. Most of the stuff is done on chips in

70
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,760
or in software in fact a lot of it's done in software but you can't do that in real time because then

71
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,120
well unless you are not interested in hearing what the mix sounds like which is just not doable

72
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,040
for someone doing a podcast on the fly the way I do them at least I just do them live

73
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,680
because then you'd hear latency and you'd hear your voice back in your headphones at least a

74
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,160
couple of fractions of a second if not more after they come out of your mouth which is very

75
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,040
very difficult to do you should try it sometimes. So what my came up with is a way to create or

76
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,640
simulate a compressor limiter by actually creating that in the hardware by or not by creating

77
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,680
it by talking to the hardware which is just phenomenal because it really really works and the sound

78
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,440
I mean there's no homes no well let's listen for a second no no homes I was able to remove all

79
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,000
of that everything sound and really good so really fantastic you know just a fantastic piece of software

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,200
so you probably noticed the size is a little bit smaller today since there's two defaults to

81
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,120
record your podcast and you can also put your show notes right in there currently the version

82
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,360
we have uploads if you want it to you can upload right up to an FTP server all your tags are taking

83
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,760
care of and of course is one step removed from the full blown service which pod show dot

84
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,320
call the offering very soon where you actually get your show blog and your RSS feed and everything

85
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,840
all in one so we're doing real good I'm very very excited about it. I got a list of stuff to talk

86
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:59,440
about today I see I hit the cast blaster got that oh tomorrow night actually thanks to Aaron from

87
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,880
parking in bitterman's circle who was a tech on the road on the current tour with Weezer has

88
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,200
hooked us up with tickets so I'll be taking Christina and a friend of hers to of all places

89
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,800
Brixton Academy which is pretty much not the nicest part of town I haven't quite figured out

90
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,280
if I want to drive it again because last time it was a first of all it's a reasonably long drive because

91
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,880
I think Brixton is more on the eastern side of London and we kind of coming on the west

92
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,440
through the southwest and I don't have to tell you what that burp is right and it's a bitch to park

93
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
and if you can park then you know you kind of wonder if you're going to come back and there's going to be

94
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,680
I don't know cinder blocks underneath this car instead of fuel wheels so we may take the train

95
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,880
in the tube or I may hire a car I'm not quite sure what I want to do yet but looking forward to doing

96
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,800
that of course I mentioned this I think on Thursday's podcast and already I'm getting lots of emails

97
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,280
saying hey you should you should I do a sound seeing towards the Weezer concert let me tell you

98
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,720
Brixton Academy is really pretty strict about cameras and recording devices and they check

99
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,200
out really well so I'm a bit wary of doing that although of course I could take the I river with me

100
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,280
and we could do some stuff in the car maybe and talk about the show afterwards we might do that that could

101
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,440
be kind of fun promos plenty of them lined up for you as usual here on the source code

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,680
www.curry.com a lot going on man shoot Patricia's taken off on Thursday for a couple of days

114
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,520
then Sunday morning I hop on the plane and go to Portland and that's where I'm going to hook up

115

with the fly boys this will be a day before win command to William comes in but I'll be training for

116
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,240
three or yeah probably out three days nonstop just doing training training training touching goes

117
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,600
touching goes touching goes probably in a sesno 172 which is one of the main reasons for it by the way

118
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,480
because you know I have the the sesno 182 retractable gear actually I say to people now I have a 182

119
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,840
RG and they say yeah I know it stands for retractable gear because they do this freaking podcast

120
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,880
I tell you people are listening to this podcast it's unbelievable remember I did the shout out

121
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,320
to Frank Casanova about the quick time issues dude I got an email like the next day from Frank Casanova

122
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,920
and he said hey how you doing um a couple people mentioned to me that you said something on the source code

123
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,880
and he was going to turn that right over to uh to the engineers at Apple and see if anything could

124
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,560
be done if it wasn't detailed something that had just kind of been laying around for a couple of years

125
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,000
and no one really deemed important until now so that's really exciting it's it's really it's quite

126
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,960
amazing it seems like there's a lot of people listening um all over the west coast actually not

127
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,240
just in a kupertino but also in redman and it's quite a pleasure to have you all along for the ride

128
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,400
if you want to know what's going on the podcast community this can be partially the place to find out

129
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,600
about I actually would recommend podcast alley to go to the uh go to the forums there to see what people are

130
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,240
really really saying but there are a couple mail lists one for the iPod or developers and then there's

131
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,760
the podcasters mailing list which is a Yahoo group and a big big discussion that last count 62

156
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,040
talking about last week uh yes yeah I miss out on Friday and then the brain goes kind of dead over

157
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,680
the weekend oh yeah I remember we're talking about accessibility um because there are you know the

158
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,640
the blind community of course is is astronomical over the entire globe and podcasting has been like

159
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,600
you know such an incredible breath of fresh air to to this community being able to

160
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,000
receive all kinds of information now via audio and I uh as if you know what the deal is with

161
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:57,920
accessibility basically with um with the programs that make computers more usable for the blind

162
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,400
and I got some interesting feedback apparently iTunes has none to almost completely or almost none

163
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,440
to absolutely zero accessibility now I don't know if that's in windows or on the Mac because I do

164
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,200
believe the Mac now has uh integrity at least it has some interesting accessibility options but

165
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,920
I've been getting a lot of comments and one of them from one of my favorite podcasters oh

166
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,320
Adam I'm Shelley Brisbane I'm a writer and a former associate editor at Mac user magazine and I'm

167
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,800
also visually impaired I wanted to share a few thoughts with you about accessibility for blind

168
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,760
people using windows in the Mac windows users don't have screen reading software built in they

169
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,800
either have to purchase jaws or window eyes which are both very expensive third party screen

170
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,200
or applications and Mac OS users didn't even have that option until OS 10.4 tiger was released

171
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,520
Apple now includes a tool called voiceover a screen reader from macOS and it's the first time I'm

172
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,440
aware of a screen reader being included in an operating system and that by itself is really exciting

173
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,640
even though voiceover really isn't quite as good as it needs to be to answer your specific

174
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,240
question it does not work with iTunes they don't communicate with each other at all voiceover does

175
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,600
work with Safari and with mail and even with iChat but iTunes users are out of luck so it's not that

176
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,800
the podcasting component of iTunes needs to be made accessible but that iTunes itself needs to talk

177
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:29,600
to voiceover and that goes for any other app that Apple ships with tiger I think it voiceover is

178
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,560
going to become more than just an ADA compliance checkbox blind people are going to have to let Apple

179
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,600
know that they'd like to become Mac users and I think once people do the math and realize that you

180
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,240
can get a Mac mini for six or seven hundred bucks which is less than the price of jaws or

181
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,360
window eyes by itself that that provides an accessibility option at a really reasonable price that

182
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,440
didn't exist before so I want to thank you for putting this in a spotlight at them and I really

183
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,360
hope that the next announcement we hear is that cast blaster is fully accessible. Actually I have

184
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,240
I've had discussions with Mike about that so I don't know if it's going to be in the first beta release

185
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,880
it's a lot of work obviously but that is pretty interesting that iTunes doesn't work with voiceover

186
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,720
I wasn't aware of that and Shelley by the way I've listened to a lot of your podcast

187
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,360
I was doing a lot of traveling between San Francisco and London and I somehow had always

188
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,560
seemed to pick up your podcast I haven't heard one in a while I wonder if you're still doing them

189
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,800
or something happened to the feed or something just broke on my end please let me know

190
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,440
now I have a hit test from young pollack he did number 43 43 came believe that 43 podcast

191
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,280

192
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,840

193
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:53,600
hit test but it's something completely different

194
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,160

278
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Lady Bianca, lay me down, it's pod save on the Daily Source code.

279
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,440
I love the pipes on that girl, of course you can find out all the info about all the songs and everything

280
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,960
played on the source code of the show notes.

281
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,720
Okay, okay, feedback out of recruit.com. Yes, your audio feedback is welcome. If you wish to

282
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,920
attach an MP3 file, but of course there are places to send off your potsafe music, your mashups

283
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,360
and anything else you want to send in. We've got three email addresses, get a pen, get ready to write it down.

284
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:08,560
And they actually make sense. It's mashup at podshow.com, podsafe at podshow.com or submit at podshow.com for

285
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,000
your promos, your actually for your podcast as well, if you want to get them on the podshow on serious.

286
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,680
And by now I think most of the pod squad has their serious radio receivers and they're all

287
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,960
enjoying it, the big blue boom boxes. And then a good time with that. Something's a mess up with the

288
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,560
show notes though. I still got to figure out what exactly is going on with that because you can't quite

289
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,720
some reason I'm not flowing through to the show notes.podshow.com weblog, but we're working on the

290
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,360
technology.

291
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,240
