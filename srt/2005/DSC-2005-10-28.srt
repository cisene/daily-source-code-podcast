1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There's no place like home, there's no place like home.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You know the weird guy in the corner of the office who always has his headphones on?

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's you!

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hot chill.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There are no secrets.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Only information you don't get out of.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Adam Curry.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm just kidding.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It is the 28th of October, 2005.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You a lady?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Come on!

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The sun is coming up over the yard arm and sunny Northern California.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
For the last time they're in this trip from the Curry condo.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It is the daily source code.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All man, I hope you're listening to this on your drive home as you're getting ready for the weekend.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I got some really special for you.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know the golden airing, of course, are a bunch of Dutch guys.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No one will know the owners of the copyrights.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Everything belongs to the song.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Although not pot safe.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Although they couldn't give me a free license.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They said they wouldn't sue me.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's good enough for me.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Crank this one up and stick it in you.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're gonna love the radar love.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's the golden airing on the daily source code.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
For Friday!

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm in driving on at my hands went on the wheel.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a voice on my head that drives my heel.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's my baby condons that need you here.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's have fast forward, I'm shifting here.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
When she is lonely and longing yet too much,

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She sets a cable coming in from above.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't need a bottle.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We're gonna stay, but I suppose we're gonna love.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We're gonna love.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The road has got me every time.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I'm spinning into a new sunrise.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When I get lonely and I'm but sure I'll have enough.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She sets a cable coming in from above.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We're gonna wave in the air.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
When I get lonely and I wish all I've had enough

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She sets the comfort coming in from above

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We don't need to let her go

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We can say, let's go, we don't need to let her go

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We can say, let's go

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We can say, let's go, we can say

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's go, we can say, let's go

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Rida love

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Damn, good morning

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Good afternoon, good evening everybody, wherever you are

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Man, is that a way to kick off a show or what?

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Golden airing, radar love, thanks to a couple of people

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
For being able to play that on the show

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For this one exception

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Actually, what I had to do is I had to ask Patricia

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
To call in to her old record company boss,

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Villain from Co to who owns

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He owned just about everything, including I think 5% of waste management ink

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And, you know, industry from an industry standard perspective

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
There's no way he could say, yeah, go ahead, do whatever you want

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Because that would set a bad precedent in the business

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But I don't think we're going to run any trouble for that

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
One little violation, at least I'm hoping

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And please, if you like the Golden airing, go buy their tracks on iTunes

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's where I got this one from, 99 cents

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And I had all the memories flowing back to me

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Whew, so this is it, the last day in the condo

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
For this trip out, then I'm back to back home

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Unfortunately, I can't fly today

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
As you know, everything was filled up so I'll be flying tomorrow

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Time to wash the sheets and clean up

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Vacuum and basically have the condo ready for the next time out

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Which will be pretty soon

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Although it'll be short one because we got some holidays coming up

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We have Thanksgiving on the way

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And then before you know, it will be in the Christmas

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And I don't know what happens in Silicon Valley

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Does everybody like go off?

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
New York, it's dead, you know, there's no business

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Between Thanksgiving and New Year's

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There's no business being done

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I wonder what happens in Silicon Valley

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It was funny, well, I had that the Golden airing

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I took off the headphones and plugged in the

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Logitech MM50 and it was just

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It was, it was, okay, I was dancing

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's be happy there wasn't a video podcast of that

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Actually it's funny because I know that

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Hasbro, I dog that we talked about earlier this week

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So I have it right next to the Logitech MM50

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Check this out, two sponsors and one mention

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is fucking amazing

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I guess I'm last night when I was listening through a couple of podcasts

135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because I got home

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
She got home at seven

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I did a Skype call with the Canon Squip show

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They're celebrating their first anniversary

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think that'll be probably

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know if it'll be out over the weekend

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But certainly by next week

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And they're putting together a huge extra

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Against it with lots of guests

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So around eight, you know, I was done

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And I figured

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I was, you know, we had a huge, huge lunch

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We sat with a guy who we're interested in working with

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Who comes from the radio business

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And it was actually pretty interesting

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We're trying to deprogram a little bit

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And he's still a bit in the radio

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
In the radio world vibe

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But anyway, so I, and then it was my time to listen to podcasts

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You know, so the iTunes on the G5I Mac

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Had done its job, had been sitting there

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Relentlessly downloading all day

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just got back and, you know, lean back with my ten-foot interface

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
With that little remote control that comes with the iMac

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And skim through stuff

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Somehow I must have activated the iDog

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Because I noticed and it was sitting right next to the speaker

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So it wasn't even plugged in to anything

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It has a built-in microphone

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And so it's sitting right next to the

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Logitech M50 and stuff is pumping out

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then on comes the new Steve Gilmore show

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If you haven't heard this, if you're in business

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And any type of business whatsoever

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is a program you must listen to

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I mean, it's, yes, it's about technology

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But man, yes, they were talking about

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What was it?

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Multi-core processing in the workplace

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And how much power

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Consumption that's going to save

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And, you know, so besides being able to run

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Fantastic applications with blazing speed

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Particularly what comes to huge ones like Photoshop

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And obviously all kinds of server stuff

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But also just saving energy within, within an organization

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was like man, this any business person

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Should be listening to attention tech

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Attention tech.potcho.com

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You can find a link of course from today's show notes

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But anyway, so the iDog was sitting right next to the Logitech

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And it came alive, right?

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It started, it's light started blinking

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And it was unbelievable. Attention tech

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Is Steve Gilmore does the show

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And does it with an industry analyst, Mike Vazard

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I swear to God

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That every single time Mike was talking

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The iDog was like, you know, little green

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And yellow lights in his head

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And his ears would go up

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And every single time Gilmore

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Come on, I don't have like a line of red lights

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know, you know, I'm just saying

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Maybe red head

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You know, was trying to portray some kind of emotion

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Of course, you know, it's a toy, right?

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's a device, it doesn't have emotion

203
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But it was, it is, maybe it's an interesting thing

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
To check podcasts with

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So I started experimenting

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it does give off different vibes

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
For different voices

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And so you could associate something with it, I guess

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not sure what, but it was, it was really phenomenal

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Anyway, so, and I wrote down

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That I wanted to, you know, of course

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The guys and gals that Apple listened to

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Or the Daily Source code, we know that

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I only know a few people over there

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But I know that there's enough of an internal network

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That people do talk to each other

217
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And it definitely gets done

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I've been playing with the ten-foot interface

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If you haven't seen this, you must check out

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The presentation that Steve Jobs did

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Of the video iPod

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because what I think was just as exciting

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And I have both products now

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Is the G5 iMac

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Now, when I went to the Apple store in San Francisco

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
They didn't have the one I wanted

227
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean, they had the 20 inch, you know

228
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What I wanted was of course

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The 20-inch dual processor

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Mega Hong car, they didn't have that one

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But that wasn't the power and speed

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That delivers wasn't necessarily what I needed

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's always happy to take away

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A new one with the built-in eyesight

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It has a 1.9 gigahertz processor

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They didn't have the extra memory

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I'll have to go back and have that upgraded

238
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
For me at the genius bar

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But one of the, let me just grab the remote here

240
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
One of the cool things about this iMac

241
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is that it has what the industry

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I guess calls is the 10-foot interface

243
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So it has a little remote control

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That is I've mentioned this before

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's probably the same housing that they use for the iPod shuffle

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It looks basically the same

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
In fact, I think it's exactly the same

248
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
With the addition of a menu button

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's how you activate

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I found out if you do applekey escape

251
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It also activates that menu bar on the iMac

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And what it basically does

253
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It gives you a way to

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It has a top menu so you can choose between movies, DVD

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Or the CD player, basic CD, DVD player

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And what am I thinking at the hell is it?

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What's the last one?

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Photos of course, there you go

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Doll

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So that's basically all you need

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And you could even hook up a

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
A tuner card or like one of those ITV things

263
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You could watch television on it

264
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But who cares? That's not interesting

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because the video podcast come in

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The audio podcast come in

267
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You can access your i photo library

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And you can play DVD on it

269
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Now what's interesting about this interface

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Is it looks very much like the iPod interface

271
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And that really works for me

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm familiar with this interface

273
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And you kind of go through the menus the same way

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But team out there

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
In a cup of tea

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You missed a couple of really important things

277
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Particularly in the podcast area

278
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Whereas in iTunes there's a little blue ball

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Next to a podcast if it's

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If you haven't heard it yet

281
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I really miss that

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Please bring that back

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then also when I go into the library

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
For songs

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's where I don't want to see podcasts

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Because then I put it on shuffle

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's going to come back to podcast

288
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And you guys already solved that

289
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And iTunes

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And on the iPod

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think you just need to connect somewhere

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And carry that over into this interface

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But I think you really onto something here

294
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is the first time of really

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You know really enjoyed this type of

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Interactivity with media

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And it has nothing to do with television

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's completely unimportant

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I can get anything I want

300
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Through this

301
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And you know I sat

302
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh man I had a

303
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Just crack in my ass off

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Last night

305
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Watching a Tiki bar

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That girl in there

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
She's hot

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And she seems like she's really that way

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Funny and a little bit ditsy

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But yeah

311
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Tiki bar

312
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's cool

313
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You know

314
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Rolled through

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And see Pacific Coast

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Hellway had had their first video

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Promo on there

318
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I watched the second episode of

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Father Roderick's Catholic Insider

320
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The Catholic Minute

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's just

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The entertainment is there

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And with this little remote control

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It works

325
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Very, very enthusiastic about it

326
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's do another release of the

327
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Interface

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Just carry a couple of those things over

329
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You already have

330
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Across the board

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Into this

332
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And what do you call it?

333
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Please

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It must have a name

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm calling it the ten foot

336
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Interface

337
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But it must have some

338
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Anyway

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
See

340
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll do it

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
When I get paid and I do it

342
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
When I don't get paid

343
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Doesn't matter to me

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm just passionate about the stuff

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We're talking about

346
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yesterday

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I talked about

348
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The

349
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The Spat

350
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I had

351
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
With PWM

352
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And offered my apologies

353
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And there were some words

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was looking for

355
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And I couldn't quite complete

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
A min of course

357
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You know

358
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Of course you guys are always there to help me

359
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hey Adam

360
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is Andrew in Santa Rosa

361
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
California

362
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Just wanted to help you out with your vocabulary

363
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I think the word you were looking for

364
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yesterday when you were talking about

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Bitching and moaning through email

366
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And you said

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Leathergic

368
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The word is actually

369
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Therapeutic

370
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So that's all

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I hope that helps you

372
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I love the show

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Take care

374
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's just thinking

375
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Couldn't it have been cathartic

376
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Maybe that was the word I was thinking

377
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh no, let me just go to

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
My favorite

379
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Dictionary

380
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Calm the mic is in the way

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The keyboard

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't usually type that slow

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay

384
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I hear you screaming

385
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Your iPod already

386
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't you know what cathartic means?

387
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Let's see

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let's just do it together

389
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Did you mean cathartic with a T?

390
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, I think that's what I meant

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay cathartic

392
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
An agent for purging the bowels

393
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Especially a laxative

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well that was it

395
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That was exactly it

396
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh man

397
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
New Bittycast came out last night

398
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
LeCivius Bitties

399
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You know my girlfriends from New York

400
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Who I met

401
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
More than a year ago

402
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They were the first people I emailed saying

403
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Would you mind if I played

404
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Some of your songs on my podcast

405
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And that actually resulted in sales

406
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And their audience grew

407
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And we've been flirting with each other ever since

408
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's been just wonderful

409
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And they have a podcast called the Bittycast

410
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And they were

411
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What they do is they basically record

412
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
For the past

413
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh there's an eye dog

414
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
For the past couple of episodes

415
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
They're on the road in the van

416
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And also some live recordings

417
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then I came across a bit

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
From the most recent Bittycast

419
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I want to play for you

420
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Because not only is it a great pod save tune

421
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Well the whole the whole thought behind it is fantastic

422
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And especially now

423
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
When people aren't talking about voting

424
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Maybe now it's the time to think about it

425
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And start ramping up our thoughts on voting

426
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So that we get something that we're all a bit happier with

427
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We, the least serious Bitty's always tried to do

428
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
A little bit of like subtle activism

429
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
For a while after

430
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We're not, you know, just supporting our fellow human being

431
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So a little while after the Hurricane Katrina

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We did some donations of CD sales

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And stuff like that

434
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And one of the things that we've been committed to

435
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
For the past few years is something that we've called

436
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Swing the vote

437
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Where we encourage people to register to vote

438
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And get out and vote

439
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And we try not to make it super lame

440
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because we know the topic

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Can some pines be a little repetitive

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Vote, vote, vote, vote

443
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Vote, vote, vote, vote

444
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So Amanda

445
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I know that

446
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But Amanda wrote this song

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That we hope you find it entertaining

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
To say the least

449
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Not annoying

450
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If the deficit's got you feeling blue

451
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Take a stroll to the pole

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And here's what you do

453
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You've had a cast that ballot

454
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Cast that ballot

455
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Cast that ballot

456
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Cast that ballot

457
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And let your voice be heard

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So you say your party is not too blame

459
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And the difference in dog is not the same

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You better cast that ballot

461
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Cast that ballot

462
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Cast that ballot

463
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You better cast that ballot

464
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And pick your favorite name

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Think slips layoffs

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Unemployment gives me the blue

467
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
As you please, our hybrid

468
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Our nose, now's the time to choose

469
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Better care the N-R-A

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So much to think about every day

471
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You better cast that ballot

472
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Cast that ballot

473
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You better cast that ballot

474
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And chase your fears away

475
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Right wing left wing everybody's swing

476
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You better cast that ballot

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000

You better cast that ballot

544
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If you're a sock, come on, I'm already as poor, never ever went to college once you wish you had

545
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You bought a cast on ballot, cast on ballot, cast on ballot, you got a cast on ballot if you don't you just be sad

546
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Some folks say the market's gonna take it maybe true

547
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Losing all of our social security, it could happen to me to you, you're right

548
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Wing up who's for the war, if you're slaving hippie who's feeling so

549
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Or you better cast that ballot, cast that ballot, cast that ballot

550
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You better cast that ballot and give your fees to chance

551
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I told you once, I told you twice, being patriotic is so nice

552
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You better cast that ballot, it's the only true American way

553
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I love you, girls

554
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Vitties

555
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Fantastic, perfect for my, that's the eye dog again

556
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Perfect for my Friday show, I'm tired, I woke up the, you know, I did something different last night

557
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I went to bed with the window with the shades up because I have window in my bedroom

558
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And the bed is elevated just about the same, the same height as the window

559
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Actually, and then you just see all the lights of the hills

560
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And it's a beautiful, beautiful view

561
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And I was like, I want to fall asleep like this

562
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And I was just hoping that the sun wouldn't wake me up in the morning

563
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But it's on the west side

564
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So my alarm goes off, well, you know the blackberry starts tingling around seven

565
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And it was still dark outside, and with, oh man, it was beautiful

566
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And I don't even know why I mentioned that

567
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, just because it was good, and life is good, that's what it was

568
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And now on the sun is up to day, it's fantastic

569
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So I'm in good spirits, but you know, just tired from

570
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
For everything we've been doing, it's been a lot of running around

571
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But very, very productive and excited to be able to, yeah, start telling you stuff

572
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Very, very soon

573
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Oh my god, another tease

574
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Let's see, what we're going to talk about

575
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh well, yesterday we had the hum test

576
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000

577

Hey, Adam, hey buddy, how you doing?

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Okay, okay, I'm ready, go!

590
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Number one

591
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I think you've done this one

592
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
This is hitting you with your best shot

593
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I've been as hard

594
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Pimes out

595
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Number two

596
00:25:49,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't remember the name of the song, but it's definitely the Thompson Twins

597
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You can hear that backwards forward

598
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Pimes out

599
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Number three

600
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Okay, here are the answers, number one

601
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh, I think I got it right

602
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
This is me with your best shot

603
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I think you did that on the first one actually

604
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And here's number two

605
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Maybe it's late your hands on me or something

606
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Hold me now

607
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Okay, I got that one

608
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Now what was that third one man?

609
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Number three

610
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh

611
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's upside down

612
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So how did you do Adam?

613
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Well, like one and a half out of three

614
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Thanks for joining us on this week's Backtracks podcast quiz

Backtracks podcast

619
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Just thinking about the lyrics again to that bitty song

620
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Right wing left wing everybody swing

621
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm there's a campaign poster for you

622
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I got a note from the podpimp

623
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Aaron Brousel he does our PR and marketing

624
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So yeah, I didn't come up with the name

625
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But he is affectionately known around the offices of the podpimp

626
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
He drives a Prius

627
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The podpimp and Prius driving

628
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
No anyway

629
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And he alerted me to a rock and roll geek episode that I

630
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I guess I know I missed it and I know why because I've iTunes configured

631
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's unfortunate you can't do it by channel

632
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I have a configured to only keep the last, you know, the most recent episode

633
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Just because I'm subscribed to so much stuff that

634
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You know it it fills up the drive and my power book starts to die

635
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And so I had to go back like three episodes

636
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I think it's let me see I have it up here

637
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Let me see which one it was

638
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It was the rock and roll geek show for

639
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I love this new little mouse nipple

640
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Now you now we finally have a mouse wheelet on the Mac

641
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It was the geek show for the 16th okay

642
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And he had constant teen from American Idol on the show in an interview

643
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He knew someone who knew his brother or something like that

644
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You know Michael Butler's reach goes far, man

645
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
He knows everybody in the business

646
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and

647
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It was actually was

648
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It was a great conversation

649
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It was fun to listen to it

650
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And what was great about is Michael was kind of

651
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
spewing his opinion about some of the other candidates

652
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
who were voted off later than Constantine

653
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And

654
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Constantine you know I was like laughing and agreeing with some stuff

655
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And it was just a nice chat

656
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You got to know how this you know people get really really really passionate about

657
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Contest like American Idol you know and

658
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The message boards over rock and roll geek.com

659
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I just just exploding and everyone's pissed off

660
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And and everyone's yelling at each other

661
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's unbelievable to see what's going on

662
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And this is all it's like subculture

663
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You know this is the TV show

664
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Or that series is you know that particular episode of series of episodes is over

665
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
This guy's been voted off

666
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Um

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And and the culture continues

668
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's just fascinating fascinating to see that unfold

669
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And once once again all due to the one is a podcast in here

670
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Adam my name's close hello close

671
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And I'm the one who subscribed to your podcast the one you requested some feedback is

672
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah

674
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
To bring me to unsubscribe from your podcast

675
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Octuliba with this worst sound I've ever heard in episode 2-5-9

676
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You've ruined everything

677
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And then in episode 2-6-2

678
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You simply forgot your sign out

679
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You kept me in a loop for at least 24 hours

680
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I wasn't able to work

681
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Because you

682
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You Adam's curry

683
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Forget to sign out

684
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And you are the one who is lamenting

685
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
On cell phones used in airplanes

686
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Oh yes

687
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You are the one

688
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
With the cell phone

689
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
During your daily source code

690
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Ruin and everything

691
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You are really trying hard to bring me to unsubscribe

692
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But Adam's curry

693
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000

694
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000

Go on try hard

696
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But I'm harder

697
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
By then

698
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You know

699
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Without guys like class

700
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We'd still have a Berlin wall

701
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Adam

702
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Hey, you didn't think I forgot your mashup did you?

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

731
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

732
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey

733
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'll turn around, wanna hurt down, knock your steps on the floor

734
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
There he walks here, now I know it's true

735
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm dead when you walk at the same time, don't you?

736
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Now now, don't know, I never let go of the road

737
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm so happy this is not a video podcast

738
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You're gonna be laughing when you saw my hair get torn

739
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That's not all about my Alasamoye impression, it's pretty gnarly too

740
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh yeah

741
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think this is gonna be one of those shows I'm gonna want to keep in the archives

742
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
This is a great mix of shit we got going on

743
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And thanks by the way everyone who sent in ideas and suggestions etc

744
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And of course this weekend is Halloween

745
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's strangely enough, we have really only one true tradition

746
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
My daughter and I, and that is the carving of the Halloween pumpkin

747
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
No matter, every age, every single year

748
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
For some reason it's just something that we've always done

749
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And I've always had a lot of fun doing together

750
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I don't know why, I think a lot of it is the goop stuff

751
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We do kind of, you know, we play a lot of freak out games with the goop

752
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You know, I of course have to force Christina as I stick her hand in there

753
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And grab some goop

754
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
A bigger than Christmas really if you think about it

755
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, I think this more tradition at Halloween

756
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So I'm so happy that I'm gonna be home just in time

757
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Cause I leave Saturday, so I'm home Sunday

758
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So just in time to, you know, do some quick, quick goop scooping

759
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Happy Halloween

760
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Other goop stuff

761
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
All right, nevermind

762
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's Derek Miller again, hey Adam

763
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm from the Penn Machine podcast

764
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And I had some comments on your Delta

765
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The Sierra Charlie October 27th edition

766
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Where you were talking about the pod show

767
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And your top spins lists

768
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Maybe you're thinking about this already

769
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But how about top pod spins for different genres

770
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Jazz, country, metal, electronic instrumentals

771
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's what I'm interested in because that's what I'm doing

772
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And how about why just the top few

773
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Or top 100 one at the top 1000

774
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Why not all of them?

775
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Why not the bottom 100 because maybe somebody wants to make a podcast

776
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Of really bad music

777
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And they should be able to find it

778
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Shouldn't they?

779
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Or how about geographically, I don't know if people report this

780
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But top spins from Europe, top spins from Australia

781
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Top spins from the greater Lake County area in Illinois

782
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Or wherever that is, I don't know

783
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Anyway, just an idea

784
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And I hope you managed to get yourself away from San Francisco

785
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Beautiful as it is, back to where you want to be soon enough

786
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm at podcast.penmachine.com

787
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And I'll see you later

788
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Happy Halloween

789
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
All right Derek, yeah, right on

790
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I hadn't actually thought of it that way

791
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I was still kind of stuck in old world radio mode there

792
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Because the top spins, I've drawn the analogy between what we have

793
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
On the Podship Music Network

794
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
As it pertains to top spins

795
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And again, we're coming out with the top spins of the day

796
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
The week, the month, and of all time

797
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And that is analogous to radio and records

798
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Which is this publication

799
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You can pick it up at new stands in New York

800
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Certainly, I'm not sure about around the country

801
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You pick up radio and records and in there

802
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's got all those types of charge

803
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Everything is broken down segmented exactly as you said

804
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Not even that good

805
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And I was listening to what you were saying

806
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I was like, dude, that makes so much sense

807
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We should just provide an interface on the back end for the podcasters

808
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
To go in and sort and do those queries themselves

809
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's easy, everything's in the database

810
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So, wow, great idea, thank you

811
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Give us a little time

812
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Because I've got Chris Rockwell

813
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Our resident poopcaster

814
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I've got him working on some other stuff

815
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh dude, we're going to have some fun

816
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm not, I'm not a lot of talked about

817
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm not a lot to do it

818
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I've been sworn to secrecy about what's happening in a very short amount of time

819
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Did you take French in school?

820
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Are you about my age?

821
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
If you are, then probably your French was

822
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Audio tapes

823
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Do you remember those?

824
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Does anyone have an audio tape of the lessons

825
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That always started like this?

826
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Bonjour, Lean

827
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Bonjour, Monsieur le professeur

828
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Sabah?

829
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Sabah, bien

830
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Hello Adam, my name is Pierre

831
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And I am the host for the PCC

832
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
The podcast of the Cabernet Canada

833
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It is a podcast in French

834
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Where I do a sound thing to offer

835
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The mantra, a real and often outside of it

836
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Thanks a lot for uploading my promo

837
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Adam, and don't worry, I won't say anything to not in French

838
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Or maybe I should

839
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
In the last week, the PCC

840
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You are going to see the ball in the hall

841
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Make sure to read it on your family

842
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And listen to the franco-foli de Montréal

843
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And learn other things

844
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So watch out for the address

845
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Cabernet Canada

846
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000

847
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000

So see you soon

850

So see you

851

Lean

852
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
See you, Monsieur le professeur

853
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Eline?

854
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yes, Monsieur le professeur

855
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Papa, Fumun Pip

856
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yes, Monsieur le professeur

857
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Emma Mont Pip Papa

858
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Hey, audition update

859
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I can only give you clues

860
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But it's all a part of my secret messaging to you

861
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
What is it that every podcaster wants?

862
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Every single podcaster

863
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Even people who aren't podcasters

864
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But want to become podcasters

865
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
If only

866
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You fill in the rest

867
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Hey, this is Dave Grossman

868
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
The fighters in the energy into the strange brews

869
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Hi, this is Kevin

870
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And I'm the sidekick Doug

871
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
In case you've missed us, this is what's been happening on the strange brewed

872
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
A side from celebrity Collins

873
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
We still talk about entertainment news

874
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Political gaffs

875
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And my favorite segment

876
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Dr. Phil's ass shabbers

877
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And I get to school

878
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And apparently the raise my still there

879
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And I teach my first hour studying all

880
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And nobody told me about it

881
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
By the time I see

882
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The raise and I'm my shirt

883
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And I look down in the middle of second hour

884
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
This has been there for two to three hours now

885
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's baked in my shirt

886
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And I've got this big grease spot

887
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Sadly

888
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
There's been an end to one popular segment on the show

889
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Kevin's e-harmony updates

890
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But the good news is I'm no longer searching

891
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Because I found a new love

892
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Conversation and everything

893
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It was very easy everything that happened

894
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It was just easy

895
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
No, I say easy

896
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't mean

897
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't mean easy

898
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I don't mean easy like that

899
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I do not mean easy like that

900
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Oh my goodness

901
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We have loads of new material to keep the occupied

902
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Like the brief but hilarious

903
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
karaoke recap

904
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Like a case of her peering of fire

905
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Writing of fire

906
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Be contrast

907
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
There's no time right

908
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Oh

909
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I see a hit to see the whets that live a man

910
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Scottled wood, scottled wood

911
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We do the fun

912
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And of course

913
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We've got ill advised Trombone duets

914
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Up the Wazir

915
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So be sure to visit us at

916
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
TheStrangeBrewdBROT.com

917
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And expect the unexpected

918
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Unless you expect funny

919
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Because you'll get a crapload of that

920
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Kick it

921
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Partio should only be enjoyed under the supervision of a podcasting professional

922
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Warning

923
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Do not attempt this at home

924
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:32,000
She's the only female conservative

925
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
That gets right to the issue

926
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But our losses

927
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That's the backbone of our politicians

928
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Now cut our losses

929
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
What we need is more ammo

930
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's just getting ready to see

931
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That damn straight-talk express

932
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Carging up your local diner

933
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Where the only straight-talk getting served

934
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Is that to the press

935
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Who will take any Republican

936
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It looks like a Democrat

937
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Is shelling the Republican

938
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Hypocrates

939
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Do you know what a hypocrite is Cindy?

940
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
The fact that you use

941
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The crosses of soldiers who have fallen

942
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
When their parents do not want any

943
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Part of your liberal movement

944
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That defames their names

945
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Or the value of their life

946
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You know what is hypocritical

947
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The fact that you enjoy the luxuries

948
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Of the American life

949
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But are not willing to defend it when it's tough

950
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Log on

951
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
To shelling the Republican.blogspot.com

952
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
To hear her latest show

953
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Shelling the Republican

954
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Bringing the Game of Politics

955
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
To a whole new level

956
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Holy moly that is a first

957
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh my goodness

958
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I have to check that out

959
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Alright, here's one for my girls

960
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I love you both

961
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'll see you in a couple days

962
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The way they do

963
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What's a melancholy

964
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Maybe they don't really care

965
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
They be moving

966
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I've never been there

967
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's not the fun

968
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And things in life

969
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's not the fun

970
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And things in life

971
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's not the fun

972
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And things in life

973
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's not the fun

974
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And things in life

975
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Maybe they don't really care

976
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Maybe they don't really care

977
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,020
It's not the fun

978
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,020
But it's not the fun

979
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,020
It's not the fun

980
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,000
It's not the fun

981
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,020
It's not the fun

982
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,020
It's not the fun

983
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,020
It's not the fun

984
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,020
It's not the fun

985
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,020
It's not the fun

986
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,960
It's not the fun

987
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,240
It's not the fun

988
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's not the time to bomb that makes us who we are.

989
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Beyond the world, the things you know they are, they will suffer.

990
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
We don't have the most of it.

991
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:10,000
We have the lucky ones reaching ways that can't be seen.

992
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The affection they are all the inside, the finest things that you can't buy.

993
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh, it's simply the love you can't deny.

994
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh, it's all about love.

995
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It's all about love.

996
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's all about love.

997
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's all about it's all about love.

998
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's all about love.

999
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Lisa Bell.

1000
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's all about love.

1001
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Found that on the Podsafe Music Network.

1002
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Music.podshow.com.

1003
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Here's how it worked.

1004
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I surfed over there this morning and upop.

1005
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
What I find it through Lynn Parsons.

1006
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Lynn Parsons.

1007
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Remember we played that promo by Lynn Parsons, who's the radio personality in the 9 Kingdom,

1008
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
who also is doing a podcast from her little tea house in the garden.

1009
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I've been invited over by the way, which I'm certainly going to do.

1010
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And she had played Lisa Bell.

1011
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
If Lynn played it, then that's whoops.

1012
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
That means something to me.

1013
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I like this stuff she plays.

1014
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And so I immediately added it to my playlist.

1015
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And of course when I'm done, I'm going to go and report that I've played it.

1016
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That is the requirement.

1017
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Really, you have to do as a podcast.

1018
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And I'll link in the show notes.

1019
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That's right.

1020
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
There you go.

1021
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Okay.

1022
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Man, it's been a great sharing this time with you today.

1023
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And I hope you have a really, really good weekend.

1024
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Well, of course we'll speak to each other.

1025
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Well, maybe not before.

1026
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Depending on where you are in the world.

1027
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So if I don't talk to you, you have a great Halloween.

1028
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And let's see.

1029
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I think that's it.

1030
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
We've covered everything in its entirety.

1031
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
The only thing we didn't do today is the rock money and off theme, which is good.

1032
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's got a little tired of that.

1033
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And change it for once.

1034
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Adamaccurry.com.

1035
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
If you want to send me feedback, it's more than welcome.

1036
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I talk a lot about the ID3 tags and I realize that you may be new to listen to the show

1037
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
or MP3s or shut up, I don't.

1038
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What's best is to find it well.

1039
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
If you're on Windows, then go get castblastartcastblastart.com because you'll just fill

1040
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
out the description and the information.

1041
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And you'll actually be creating a little mini podcast, except you're then going to

1042
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
send that to me.

1043
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Now here's the final trick is I really prefer if you don't attach it to your email.

1044
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Because even though I have a special four gig allotment on the Gmail due to my

1045
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
30-ness factor, please put it up on the server somewhere.

1046
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And just send me the link to the server.

1047
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That was much, much more convenient.

1048
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Maybe we should just have a server for you guys.

1049
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm going to set it up so you can, so you don't have to waste your own bandwidth on

1050
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
that shit.

1051
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
We got $9 million.

1052
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
We can do that.

1053
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Alrighty.

1054
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
DailySourceCode.com is where you can always find the latest episode.

1055
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And now I'd like you to close your eyes.

1056
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Okay.

1057
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Envision everything in black and white.

1058
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And now it colorizes.

1059
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But anyway, total, we're home.

1060
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Oh.

1061
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And this is my room.

1062
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And you're all here.

1063
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again.

1064
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Because I love you all.

1065
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And oh, and I am.

1066
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
There's no place like home.

1067
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Another pod show podcast.

1068
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Stick it in your ear.
