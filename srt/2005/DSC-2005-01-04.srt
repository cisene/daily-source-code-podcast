1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's time we've got to get that band with us.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, you saw it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The laser began as you reach Web Channel.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There were times this hit shut out of your text.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is Ranger's final score last night at 9.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Really?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First on 635, I'll be joined.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's Adam Curry.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Adam Curry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Coming to you from Miami, Florida.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey everybody, good morning.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It is Tuesday.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's January 4th, 2004.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Coming to you from my hotel bin.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's right.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I feel like John Lennon is just for a minute.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hey, it's the source code.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's your daily source code.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're partying together once again for this lovely Tuesday.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, so I got a cop to it.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Actually, I tried to record this show last night.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I got about 20 minutes into it.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You might have heard me explain it in the past.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I have these meters that I hook up to make sure that I'm, you know,

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that not only my voice, but also the sound clips that I'm playing

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
are be recorded.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's about after 20, 23 minutes.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You know, I'm laying on the bed.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's about midnight because Dave Ron and I had,

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
of course, dinner, dinner, drinks, you know, coffee, etc.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I also didn't notice that the meters are crispy.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Which is probably all for the better because, you know,

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
if you take the delay, the jet lag, the delay on the headphones,

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
of course, this is the latency that we've been talking about

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and learning about.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
By the way, I had a dream about that last night,

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
how I can solve this.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I need an extra wire.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think I need to make a radio check run today.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We'll figure that out in a meantime.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not too sad about yesterday's or last night's show

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
not completely working out because

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I fucked up.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And as I said, it wasn't sounding good.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
With the delay, with the jet lag.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And then, of course, well, you know,

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you know, I snuck some weed into the country, right?

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You know, I did that.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So if you slept weird on the wrong side of the clock

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and you had a nice dinner and a nice chat

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and you're laying down on your bed.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hold on a second, what's that?

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, that's the alarm clock.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hold on.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Everybody.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What a one point.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Listen to that.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Wait.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can name your return to the century fire.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, for money, they have to retrieve the century fire engine.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's radio today, folks.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All of this.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm gonna be turned this fucker off.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Say to 8 a.m.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A rising shine.

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The show should be up more or less by,

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'd say about by 9.30 a.m. Eastern time,

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which is kind of, well, right on par, right?

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So anyway, so I've got everything set up on the bed,

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
because in the hotel here, there's no Wi-Fi.

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Of course, Dave has a linksis with him,

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and Ron has a linksis.

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't have one, but we'll be hooking all that up today.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I've got the hard wired option,

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but it is screamingly fast here at the hotel,

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the Incernet.

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Of course, you know, where I'm coming from,

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
anything can be screamingly fast.

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I got lots to talk about.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I want to talk about a new podcast that I've,

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
well, actually, not a new podcast,

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but a podcast I talked about recently,

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but that I really had a chance to a scour on,

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
on the plane.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So that's coming up.

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And I'm happy to report that it was not a fluke.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It was not a one-off.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We actually do have it every single day.

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ron, Ron, it is of the day.

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Today is Cadence is from the Purdue University Drumline.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, can't give everybody a good morning.

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're daily cadence on the source code.

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you get the blood pumping y'all.

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That was a role that made in so good day.

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, we got to work on the sweepers.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We got to get the sweepers in the,

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and the, and the jingles worked on,

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
but lovely great cadence today.

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And of course, we hope to provide you

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
with a new cadence tomorrow.

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we had,

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
uh, excellent start.

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'd have to say of,

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
uh, of our week here in,

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,880
in Miami, which I'm actually Ron's wife, Marta,

125
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,760
and I've known Ron Bloom for 10 years.

126
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,920
I've known Dave a little bit less than that,

127
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,720
probably about eight years.

128
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,000
Ron's wife, Marta, known for a couple years,

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
as well, six years, six years, I guess.

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,720
So Ron and Marta live here with his son, Augie,

131
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,960
in Miami.

132
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,000
And Marta was listening to a previous source code

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,480
and said, tell Adam, tell Adam not to say,

134
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
Miami, it's South Beach.

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,240
So I'm all for South Beach,

136
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
because that is where we are at.

137
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,640
And that's where you're gonna hear the podcast

138
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,320
coming from in the next few days.

139
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,720
It's also where the blog post will be coming from

140
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,880
and it's where we're just trying to figure out life.

141
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,680
Three guys, all middle-aged, trying to figure out

142
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
what we can do and how can we can have the most fun

143
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,960
and involve as many friends and family

144
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,520
and fun people as we can to really do something

145
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
interesting.

146
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,680
And so it's kind of cool,

147
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,680
because I know these two guys both very well

148
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,320
consider both of them, my friends.

149
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,120
And it's fun to watch them, seek each other out.

150
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,360
And in a way, it's kind of like dogs,

151
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,440
sniffing each other's butt.

152
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,120
Actually, I think of the butt sniffing phase as way gone.

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,440
But it's just learning each other's philosophy in life.

154
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,120
And from there, I think we'll have a pretty good

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,120
solid foundation to figure out what if anything we can do.

156
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,880
And it's just fun, it's kind of like,

157
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,600
it's a bit like Oceans 11.

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Only since Oceans 12 has already been taped

159
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,920
and flopped, I guess, would be Oceans 13.

160
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,520
Where the old gangs get together,

161
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,680
you know, I started in a ran a company with Ron

162
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,560
and that was a very successful for the company.

163
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,720
It's investors.

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,600
I'd say most of the employees,

165
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,200
at a certain point after we were out,

166
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,120
I think everything that had a dot com next to it,

167
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,360
kind of had to cut and fold and do stuff.

168
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,840
But we sure had a damn good time.

169
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,560
And a lot of people had a good time with us.

170
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,080
And I'm happy to report that a lot of people we work with,

171
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,600
we still talk to, I dig that.

172
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,920
Anyway, for today's show, what I have lined up

173
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,040
is a couple of things that I was listening to on the plane.

174
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,480
And by the way, I want to thank British Airways

175
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,480
for taking such great care of me.

176
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,040
I had booked a coach class ticket

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,440
or what they call world traveler class.

178
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,920
Which is actually quite nice on British Airways.

179
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,560
British Airways is great airline.

180
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,280
Not the cheapest airline I have to say,

181
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
but you do get the service when you pay for it.

182
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,040
So if you're in the back of the bus,

183
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,560
you're still getting very nice service, very friendly service.

184
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
And actually the stewardesses are prettier in the back.

185
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,520
I have to say, so are the stewardes, by the way.

186
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,400
And I think that, well, first of all,

187
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
it's a very busy time to come to Miami.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,840
It's very expensive.

189
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,000
I think my ticket was 2,000 bucks as it is just for coach.

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Of course, I took a full fair coach,

191
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,040
because I did want some flexibility

192
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,920
if I wanted to change my return ticket, et cetera.

193
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,240
And I actually thought on Friday or Saturday, oh, man.

194
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
It's going to be like nine hours in this plane.

195
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,120
And I haven't slept too well.

196
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm back hurting already.

197
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,840
Maybe I should just upgrade to business class,

198
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
which is what do they call it?

199
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
It's a club class.

200
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,440
And then I said, you can go online and you can say,

201
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,400
it would upgrade me one class of service.

202
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,120
And it was like 1,800 pounds.

203
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,000
It was like more than $3,000 just for one way upgrade.

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,680
So thank you.

205
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,400
I'll take the new G5, you know,

206
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,360
they'll just tell that the new power book, fuck that.

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,240
And good karma, you know,

208
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
because when I got to the airport,

209
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,840
I was nice and early and I checked it.

210
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,480
And the young lady at the check-in,

211
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,320
you're so nice and you said, oh, you know what?

212
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,120
Would you like, see, you have a window seat.

213
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,320
And like, man, could you try and get me an aisle

214
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,360
because I really, you know, especially in the back

215
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,240
or thinking, shit, I don't want people climbing over me.

216
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,160
I want to be able to get out.

217
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,800
I don't need to see out the window, you know,

218
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm a pilot.

219
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,320
It's not unless I'm looking out the front window.

220
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,480
Thank you very much.

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
She said, well, I'm sorry.

222
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,240
I don't have a window.

223
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
I don't have a window.

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
An aisle seat available in club.

225
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,960
So she upgraded me right there.

226
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,040
And that was really nice.

227
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,480
And I said, thank you, yeah.

228
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,560
Of course, they write on your ticket, no lounge access

229
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,440
because you didn't really pay for it.

230
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,800
And then, as I was boarding the plane,

231
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,240
and these are, you know, these are big mother planes.

232
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,360
I think it was an airbus.

233
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,080
And already in the club class, I'm pretty sure,

234
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
a way as you get a sleeper seat, you know.

235
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
It's like, it's a, it's a great deal.

236
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
This, that's what I flew on when I went to San Francisco,

237
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,360
I flew club.

238
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,200
And you can completely recline.

239
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,440
And I'm six-four, and I can lay down entirely,

240
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,560
stretched out on these sleeper seats.

241
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,400
And as I walked in, they upgraded me yet again

242
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,920
to first class, because I guess they had to show

243
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,880
more people in the back or whatever it was oversold,

244
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,440
busy time, as I said.

245
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,560
And so imagine, you know, if club or business class is so nice

246
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,720
and I've flown first class plenty of times,

247
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,880
and I've paid for it plenty of times on British Airways,

248
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,840
but it's nice to get it for free.

249
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,480
And you get them, the Mahagatee sleeper seat, you know,

250
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,000
and the free magazine, and you get your personal video.

251
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,440
So you besides the 18 channels of the video

252
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,520
on the TV screen, you can also order a video tape

253
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,320
and plot that into your arm rest player.

254
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,800
So that was just fantastic.

255
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,280
And I slept, and I slept, and I was just great,

256
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,720
and the food was wonderful.

257
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,480
Although I'm pretty sure that the flight attendants,

258
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
that they know everyone who's been upgraded

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,480
and has been kind of bumped up to the first class cabin.

260
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
And I feel that somehow I got a little less service

261
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,640
than when I paid for it.

262
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,480
You know what I mean?

263
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,840
It wasn't discurdious or anything,

264
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,520
but they weren't like all over my ass,

265
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,760
asking me if I wanted this, if I wanted that,

266
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
I woke up about an hour before landing.

267
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,560
Normally, they'll offer you breakfast, you know,

268
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,480
so I had to kind of ask for it, but okay, it's all right.

269
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,800
It was a good deal, very, very happy.

270
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,400
And of course, then I still had to wait like 45 minutes

271
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,240
for my bag, you know, which is not bad,

272
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,680
but I've had it happen more than on one occasion

273
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,720
when you pay for first class,

274
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
and you're still waiting 45 minutes for your bag.

275
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,760
And that just pisses you off.

276
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,880
So anyway, started on a great note,

277
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,760
and I hadn't told Dave when I was arriving.

278
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,280
He knew I was arriving on Monday,

279
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,560
I just said I'll see you on Monday,

280
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
and he was coming in from St. Augustine,

281
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,760
we fucking believe it,

282
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,000
Ron picked me up at the airport.

283
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,720
And so, you know, take the 45 minutes into account,

284
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,280
and all the stuff that we never coordinated,

285
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,640
or it certainly wouldn't have worked

286
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,000
if we did coordinated,

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
and Dave was driving down from St. Augustine 350 miles.

288
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,320
I was coming in from London.

289
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,240
We arrived at, I mean, literally,

290
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,520
we were in the parking lot of the hotel

291
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,240
at the same time, love that.

292
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,580
Just means that we're in St.

293
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,100
You know, it feels good, feels good.

294
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
So anyway, moving along for today.

295
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,780
All right, so I was listening to a whole bunch of podcasts.

296
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,100
On my I River, by the way,

297
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,740
even though I loaded up the iPod with some audio books,

298
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,940
I basically drag my entire iPod or download folder

299
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,100
right onto my I River,

300
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,740
and I'm really liking this I River.

301
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,860
First of all, on one double A battery,

302
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,140
you get 40 hours of player time,

303
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,020
40, 40 hours of playing time.

304
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,860
I didn't even lose one little LAD on the readout

305
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,740
from my battery status during the trip,

306
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,540
and I had it, I literally was playing podcast

307
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,380
throughout the entire trip.

308
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,140
It's nice and small, you can set it

309
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,820
so that it loops through A folder,

310
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,420
you know, or you only place that folder.

311
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,460
You're basically looking at your file directory

312
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,420
when you're looking at,

313
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,100
when you're using the interface on the I River.

314
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,900
It's not bad, it really isn't.

315
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,100
I got to say I'm quite amazed.

316
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,220
And I heard a great, a great rock and roll geek show.

317
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,700
Of course, American Heartbreak is as we speak

318
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,660
on tour in Europe, unfortunately,

319
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,620
I'm missing the shows in Germany and the Netherlands,

320
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,220
but might be able to pick up a show

321
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,980
when I get back, so I've got to figure out exactly

322
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,820
where they're gonna be.

323
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,900
I'm on the guest list, you know, for every single,

324
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,460
American Heartbreak show during their European tour.

325
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,060
Just like hell, it was everybody.

326
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,220
But Michael Butler, in case you hadn't heard on just

327
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,340
the recent Rock and Roll Geek show,

328
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,300
hosted a concert in his backyard

329
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,540
for 50,000 of his closest personal friends.

330
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,100
It was kind of like a Barbara Streisand thing,

331
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,300
you know, except it was a rock concert.

332
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,940
He had a guy cheap trick there.

333
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,500
He had the nudge there, of course,

334
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,220
all his podcasts and buddies.

335
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,100
And at a certain point, Michael Butler comes up on stage

336
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,900
and I'll play this bit for you.

337
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,540
I did a fly by in the helicopter.

338
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,780
You got to hear the show, you got to hear it.

339
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,380
So here's Michael Butler, right?

340
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,220
He's on stage.

341
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,060
I got a question for everybody here.

342
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,860
Everybody here, like to drink alcohol.

343
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,660
Let's hear it.

344
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,500
Now I got a question here.

345
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,700
Anybody here, like to drink beer.

346
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,860
Let's hear it.

347
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,180
Yeah.

348
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,420
Yeah, yeah.

349
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,180
We like beer.

350
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,220
Oh, yeah.

351
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,980
I'll like it too.

352
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,540
Now, what kind of beer do you like to drink?

353
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,740
Did anybody out there like to drink?

354
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
Lionakin.

355
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,380
What's the likes to drink, Lionakin?

356
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,740
Now you're listening to the guy who lives on Heineken, right?

357
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,220
So Heineken, I know you're listening.

358
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,180
I know someone who's listening to this podcast.

359
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,580
I told you, I called up Heineken.

360
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,020
I said, you guys, give him a case

361
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,220
of Heineken a month.

362
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,100
He is the biggest supporter of your brand.

363
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,020
What happens?

364
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,900
They come out with some like house techno music show

365
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,460
as a podcast and say, oh, we're podcasting.

366
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,220
You fucked up in this community Heineken.

367
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,820
You really did.

368
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,420
And listen to it.

369
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,780
This is what's happening.

370
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,300
Of course, Michael is such a nice guy that, you know,

371
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,140
he's a nice guy.

372
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,980
He's really is.

373
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,940
And so he's like, yeah, there you go.

374
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,380
He couldn't leave it at that, right?

375
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,100
Come on.

376
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Let's hear it from us.

377
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Yeah, come on.

378
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
We love the taste.

379
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
That's more alive.

380
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,420
But they got to get their ass out.

381
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,580
They're heads out of their ass.

382
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
That's more alive.

383
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,580
That's more like it.

384
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,220
Now, anybody out there like to smoke the weed.

385
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Yeah.

386
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,220
There you are.

387
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,220
Yeah.

388
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,220
Okay.

389
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,420
It's a great show, by the way, because he has all these great

390
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,860
life performances by, as I said, Chief Trick, Ted Nujinta,

392

393
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,540

400
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,140
Welcome to the vinyl podcast.

401
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,860
My name is Cody, and on each show,

402
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,420
I play you a song from my collection of LPs, 45s,

403
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,660
seven inches, 10 inches, and 12 inches.

404
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,300
I got my 12 inch ready here myself, actually.

405
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,860
I'm focusing on music that's currently out of print.

406
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,180
You can find the show on the web at vinylpodcast.com.

407
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,340
And you can reach me with comments at Cody

408
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,860
at vinylpodcast.com.

409
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,620
Well, I suppose it's an inevitable point

410
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,060
that each podcast or reach is sooner or later.

411
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,300
Now's my turn.

412
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,140
This is the first official Adam Curry suck up a vinyl podcast.

413
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,260
Ha ha ha ha ha.

414
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,620
Boy, oh, everyone has to go through it, right?

415
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,020
It's like initiation.

416
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,260
You have to do a suck up.

417
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,220
Ha ha.

418
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,900
It works.

419
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,940
On a show the other day, Adam played a live version

420
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,540
of Hang On Slupe, performed by Rick Deringer,

421
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,900
and it reminded me of this version of the same song

422
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,820
that I had in my collection.

423
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,180
So today I'm going to play Hang On Slupe

424
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,900
as recorded by David Porter.

425
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,460
It was on his album into a real thing, released in 1972,

426
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,300
I believe, on Enterprise Records.

427
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,140
But the version I have is actually on a 45.

428
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,100
The flip side of which is I'm afraid the masquerade

429
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:17,020
is over off of his victim of the joke LP.

430
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,020
David Porter is most well known as a songwriter.

431
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:29,860
He and Isaac Hayes of Shaft and Chef fame wrote a great deal

432
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:36,020
of hits for the stacks label in the 60s and into the 70s

433
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,500
and for the Enterprise subsidiary that this

434
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,140
and much of Isaac Hayes' work were released on.

435
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
This is a pretty odd version of the song.

436
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,220
It's nothing like the Rick Deringer version.

437
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,380
There's lots of strings and backing vocals

438
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,620
and it's a pretty elaborate early 70s soul production.

439
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,460
So here is Hang On Slupe, recorded by David Porter

440
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,620
on the vinyl podcast.

441
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:32,620
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

442
00:18:32,620 --> 00:19:02,620
, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh, ooh, ooh. ooh, ooh give and do, ooh, so

443
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:15,760
Hanging up, you got your hands on me, then baby, hang on, hold me.

444
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:28,560
I believe I want to tell you, why they call my baby a snoop bag.

445
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:37,880
I remember one night, we decided to go out with some friends.

446
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:46,000
And we went to this big dance, you know, and we were trying hard to really enjoy ourselves.

447
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,560
And all of our friends were looking at us and snooping out, didn't care, we didn't think

448
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,800
about it.

449
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:00,400
But you know what happened, don't go and look, you know what happened.

450
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,400
The pain that was holding snoop is dress broke.

451
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:14,400
People were looking at snooping, they were looking at all of snooping itself.

452
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,600
And snooping turned to me and said, they did, they're laughing at us, I said yes darling, I know.

453
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,640
I hope it had nurtured too bad, and she said to me, no, David, it had nurtured me.

454
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,920
Because they came really, see, you see, they're looking at the outside of me.

455
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,800
But David, you see the inside, you can see within, because you know what's really there,

456
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:44,800
darling, you play it there, and I just wanted to do some strange right there, but I didn't.

457
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,200
And I just want to ask the world, have you ever seen a herd of a girl?

458
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Like my swoeping.

459
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,200
Hey oooh snoobechube Ella!

460
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Snooping, you got it ya!

461
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Yeah, the time you know, the snoopy lets your head out

462
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,200
And it down on me, yeah

463
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Baby, oh, snoopy, hey, no

464
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
It's got dark

465
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Hey, oh, don't lose your hope

466
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Oh, this loo we got

467
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Let him talk to him

468
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,200
That was hang on snoopy by David Porter on the vinyl podcast

469
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Adam, if you're listening, hope you enjoyed that

470
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Dude, I rocked out to it, totally loved it

471
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200

Excellent, so that's the vinyl podcast

476
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
I must say nice to hear

477
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You know, a needle crackling on the vinyl

478
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Then that sounds nice

479
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,200
I think it really, yeah, it makes it, it really does

480
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I've subscribed now to the vinyl podcast

481
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I think this actually did this come through

482
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Openpodcast.org, I can't remember how

483
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Now it might have actually

484
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Anyway, vinyl podcast

485
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,200
And you could check out all the podcasts in the iPod.org directory

486
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Let's see a couple updates

487
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,200
The morning at 830 British telecom was supposed to be at the cottage

488
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
To install the lines so that easy net

489
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Can give my mega honk and pipe

490
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Hook me up and connect me for my four megabit connection

491
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Patricia Christina, we're already, you know, 830

492
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,200
The BT, they sent the confirmation will be between 830am and 1230pm

493
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Of course, it 805am is when the guy is knocking on the door

494
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
And Patricia was like not totally ready

495
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,200
So she ran down probably

496
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
The guy must have gotten a shock

497
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I don't know what she was wearing, but it probably wasn't much

498
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
And so hooked it all up

499
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Install the line did all the stuff necessary

500
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,200
It said, oh yeah, but you know, you need another phone line

501
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Huh?

502
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Yeah

503
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Well, you need another phone line

504
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
But it's no problem because we'll run one right up to the house

505
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Which was the whole point of the exercise

506
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,200
So that's probably going to happen later this week

507
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
And the minute they do that

508
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
And basically they just have to dig a hole on the street

509
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
And run it up to the front door

510
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
They don't have to come in

511
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Then they connect it and it should all work

512
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,200
I'm hoping, folks, I'm hoping

513
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Patricia totally buttered the guy up, right?

514
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Adam, you know, fed him tea and crumpets and whatever

515
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,200
And while he was installing all the wiring inside

516
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
So hopefully it will actually happen

517
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
I got the easy net guys on the case

518
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Hopefully by the time I get back there

519
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
We'll actually be a router sitting there right next to my desk

520
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,200
With a big honk and four megabit incoming line

521
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Oh god, please let it be true, let it be true

522
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,200
See what else was going to talk about today

523
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Okay

524
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,200
A new podcast that I've become totally hooked on

525
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,200
I mean absolutely totally hooked on is yeast radio

526
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
I know I've played a bit of this before

527
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Mads Weinstein is the host of yeast radio

528
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,200
And I don't know what Mads looks like

529
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
But just from the way she talks

530
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
And what she's saying and political statements

531
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
And a complete liberal

532
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200
To me it feels like the young to Rush Limbaugh's young

533
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,200
If you will, you know, very outspoken

534
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Doesn't hold back and by the way

535
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
You can do all this on the podcast

536
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
You can totally be yourself

537
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Which is so wonderful about this medium

538
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
That we're building together about this

539
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
This public spectrum, you know, these airwaves that are ours

540
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
That, well, I guess in a way they are kind of airwaves

541
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
You know, you're receiving them through Wi-Fi

542
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Receiving them in so different ways

543
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
And Mads is

544
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I don't know just something about what she says

545
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
And the way she says it, you know, I was laughing out loud

546
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
On the plane when I was listening

547
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I had three podcasts, I had listened to all of them

548
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
And I'm going to play you a couple of bits

549
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Because it'll give you a real good idea

550
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Of what yeast radio is about

551
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
And also it's all the bits where I mentioned

552
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Of course, right?

553
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Boeing moments, that's what we call them, Boeing moments

554
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Shut up so I can start

555
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Oh god, damn it

556
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Shut up

557
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I'm recording you asshole

558
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Hello everybody

559
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Shut up

560
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Hello everybody

561
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,200
This is Mads Weinstein with another on location

562
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Issue of yeast radio

563
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
I'm at the home of Fausto Fernos

564
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Who has a very important announcement to make

565
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Before we get going on our conversation

566
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Hi

567
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Oh, Mads, it was so nice listening to Adam Curry

568
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Talking about your podcast

569
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,200
It's like I haven't been listening to Adam Curry's podcast of his own

570
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,200
But when I first heard his voice, it took me about 10 years

571
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Back to when I was a teenager

572
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,200
And I would spend hours watching him on MTV

573
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Or was that the H1?

574
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Oh, you be such

575
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Oh man, there's a cup, you know, I don't care what you say

576
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
But the thing that always really hurts is when people say

577
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Wasn't he on VH1?

578
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Seven and a half years at MTV

579
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Now, at the time when I was on MTV

580
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,200
There were people VJs on VH1

581
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Most notably Tim Bird

582
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
And Tim Bird was a radio geek

583
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
And he had the whole radio geek thing going

584
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
He also had kind of like shoulder length hair

585
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
I was like, hey everybody, welcome to VH1

586
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Video hits one, it's Tim Bird the Birdman

587
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,200
But here's some glorious stuff on

588
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
And then of course there was

589
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
The launching of a career on VH1

590
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
And I feel partly responsible for that

591
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Because when she did her audition for VH1

592
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
She basically interviewed me and took the piss out of me

593
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
On camera, which was a great

594
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Rosie O'Donnell

595
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
She started on VH1

596
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
And it was very funny

597
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,200
And I used to go watch her comedy clubs in New Jersey

598
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
And she crack on my hair and shit

599
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
And about the big MTV logo

600
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I've got stamped on my butt

601
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
You know, so

602
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Please, that's the only thing that gets my goat

603
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
It's when people say we're gonna be in VH1

604
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
But anyway, I guess I missed a show

605
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Because, well listen what happens next

606
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
That was MTV

607
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Now what else did you want to say?

608
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,200
I'm sorry for calling you a husband

609
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Because now you reinvented yourself

610
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Okay, so

611
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Let me go get my dress

612
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
My internet guru

613
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Yes

614
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I guess I missed something

615
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
There was something something must have happened

616
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
And I didn't quite hear it

617
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
I must have been called

618
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
It has been

619
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
So I've been talking about

620
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
I don't think only it was one or two times

621
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I talked about use radio

622
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
But so I was on the plane

623
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Got the I River on

624
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
And I'm dozing off in the sleep right now

625
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
So I hear my name

626
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
And they're like

627
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
What?

628
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
And I just wake up

629
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Oh my god

630
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
And well, here's the art of what I live with

631
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I share it on the internet

632
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
The internet

633
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
And I've got a fabulous show

634
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Lined up for you

635
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Well, to be honest, I haven't got anything

636
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Lined up for you

637
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Why?

638
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Because I fucking work all day

639
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
You think I have nothing better to do

640
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Than to write up

641
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Of some god damn

642
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
OPML

643
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
So if you have something to listen to

644
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
And play

645
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Mad, I love you

646
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Now this is what I'm talking about

647
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Clearly a very serious podcast

648
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
You know, into writing up show notes

649
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Into OPML

650
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
And then just

651
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Bitching at everyone about it

652
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
I love them

653
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
And bitch about

654
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Complain about

655
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
No

656
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
I got a job

657
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
I got a day job

658
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
God damn

659
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I think Mad actually manages a

660
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Girl band

661
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Mad

662
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Send me an MP3

663
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
I want to hear what

664
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
You have what their stuff is like

665
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
You know, let's let's get some

666
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Some pod save tunes going here on the show

667
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
And it's not fucking easy

668
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Then I got to deal with gusty all day too

669
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
I got to support this woman

670
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
She works at the path mark

671
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Okay, so then so you got a little bit

672
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Of background on

673
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm Mad's life here

674
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Now here's the part where Mad started talking about me

675
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
And I have a song to play for Mad

676
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
After this so I'll come in

677
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
And I'll break into this bit

678
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Once or twice

679
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
It's about two minutes

680
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
I think you'll enjoy it

681
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Oh, by the way

682
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Not totally safe for work

683
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
This used radio stuff, okay?

684
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Anyway, I think I'm done talking about that now

685
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I'm so pleased

686
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Because Adam Curry keeps promoting me

687
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
This is the second time he's talked about my show

688
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
And I'm so touched

689
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
And I must say I'm also touched

690
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
That his mother is cancer free

691
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I think that's so phenomenal

692
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
You know, it's wonderful

693
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,200
When you can have so many people praying

694
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
And hoping for your health of a loved one

695
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
You know, it helps

696
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,200
And I'm not a spiritual person in the conservative sense

697
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,200
But I do have my own sort of personal spirituality

698
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Most let's be in the stew

699
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
You know, sure I have a few crystals

700
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
And I like to go to short mountain

701
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,200
And hold hands with some female to male

702
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Trends gendered with their breasts locked off

703
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
You know, that's part of life

704
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Part of life is hanging out

705
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
With your fellow sisters and brothers

706
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Who've had gender parts removed

707
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Or gender parts added

708
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
And yeah

709
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
I don't know, I have different fantasies

710
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Man and I'm sorry

711
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I'm a different kind of lesbian

712
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
In order to feel more whole

713
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Which there's a little bit of irony

714
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
That's somewhere I can't figure it out

715
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Oh Christ

716
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Let's see

717
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Oh do I have to sink my goddamn iPod

718
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Did I not do my show preparation for this crap

719
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Oh let's see

720
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Okay, I'm gonna sink the iPod

721
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
So I need to belive

722
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
And by the way, that was something wonderful

723
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Matt just said there about my mom

724
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Thank you very much for that

725
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
And I totally agree it is wonderful

726
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
When you get that vibe

727
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
And I think everyone who has been

728
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Thinking about my mom and praying for

729
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
She's home now

730
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
She was home before the new years

731
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
And literally the doctor said, Mrs. Clark

732
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Because that's her maiden name

733
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
She no longer goes by curry

734
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Mrs. Clark, you are healed

735
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
We're very happy

736
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,200
There's nothing more we need to do for you

737
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
You don't need any radiation or chemo

738
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Go home, have a great life

739
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
We'll see you in a month for a check-up

740
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
That's the power

741
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
That was fucking beautiful

742
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Okay, back to Madge

743
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
About five more seconds

744
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
While I'm trying to get this old wrapped up

745
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Before the goddamn pizza alarm comes on

746
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Because if you hear the pizza alarm

747
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
You're gonna hear Madge go scram

748
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,200
And this microphone's gonna fall on its ass

749
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Well, microphones don't hear bass

750
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
But I show his help too

751
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
I got a big fat one

752
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
I got a big fat ass

753
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
And a hot cond

754
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
And ain't nobody gonna take it away

755
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Hey, baby

756
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
I got so much to do

757
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I was sick from work today

758
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
And I got to edit some more stuff

759
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
The image is totally into this editing

760
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Doing opimil show notes

761
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
I mean this is a serious podcast

762
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
In saying films

763
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
You should check out my video site

764
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
In saying films.com

765
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
When you can watch me cook

766
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,200
I make my special being dish called les beans

767
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
I also make licorice

768
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
You get memorandum. I can get to this store

769
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
In my high-rise building

770
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Before one hour from now

771
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
I want to play that nice little promotion

772
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,200
That I'm curry made for me

773
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
You know, if I were ever

774
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
To sit on a man's face

775
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
I think it would have to be out

776
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I'm curry's face

777
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
I think I got to do a little boring here

778
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Because I appreciate the thought

779
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
I'm sorry, but it would

780
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
You know, because he is

781
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Well, I don't want him to blush

782
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Maybe he'll stop listening to me

783
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Oh, never, I'm committed

784
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
He's got the kind of face that a lesbian

785
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Could really sit on

786
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
And it's all I'm gonna say

787
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Studies, study, that's the point

788
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
That is a bit of each video

789
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Mads Weinstein, this one's for you darling

790
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
It's going to be here

791
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Hello, I'm 160

792
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
It's going to be anywhere

793
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Ah

794
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,200
It's good to see a few old wins that I wake at 9

795
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Yeah

796
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,200
When I'm sitting on your face

797
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Nothing ever can we place the way

798
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,200
That I feel about you

799
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,200
I can almost see your eyes

800
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,200
There between my trembling thighs

801
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,200
But my tips seem to walk off the view

802
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Ah

803
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Some say that our love is immortal

804
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,200
But I think it's charming, yeah

805
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,200
You can't make babies with a tongue

806
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,200
So tell me

807
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Ah

808
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Who's humming

809
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,200
When you're talking to my friend

810
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,200
There is so much I can learn from us

811
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,200
With cunning linguists like you

812
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I don't mind your more than us

813
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,200
When it's more the wind on the south

814
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,200
To the country I call my way away

815
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Ah, I've got you white

816
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Where you want me

817
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,200
In my favorite place

818
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,200
So I'm sitting here my dear

819
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Looking in my two way mirror

820
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Watching me sitting on your face

821
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Hello, Airway

822
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
How is it big boy?

823
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
I remember you, I got wench mouth

824
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
When you're in the twenches

825
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Hello hands

826
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Still nine inches

827
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
A while

828
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,200
I've got you white

829
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Where you want me

830
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,200
In my favorite place

831
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,200
In our own ex-weighted show

832
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Me above and you be well

833
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Diving me crazy

834
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,200
On your face

835
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Girl would do shit

836
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Your face all mine

837
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Are we friends?

838
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
A big band of blues

839
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Mary Lou

840
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
I'm going out to Madge Weinstein my new girlfriend

841
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Sorry, Don

842
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,200
I got to tell you, Madge got to go and on

843
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Check out East Radio, y'all

844
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Besides the obvious sexual content

845
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
It's also just fucking cool

846
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,200
There's some really good statements about

847
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Well, it's very liberal

848
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
It's very liberal

849
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
And please I invite all you red status

850
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Please come on and listen

851
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Join the Madge Weinstein East Radio party

852
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Everybody in the kitchen

853
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
I'm taking a bath

854
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,200
I'm taking a bath

855
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
Good night

856
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Good night

857
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Everybody

858
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Take care

859
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
That's right

860
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
I'm going to end it here

861
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Perfect timing just about 40 minutes for today's source code

862
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Oops

863
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Oh, that really sucked

864
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
It wasn't so professional

865
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Let's try that again

866
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
And yeah, that's it for the show for today

867
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Everybody for January 4, 2005

868
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Okay

869
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,200
I'm going to go get some breakfast after a quick compression

870
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
I uploaded the show

871
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
And then

872
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Yeah, it's the first full day of our week here in Miami

873
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I'm sorry

874
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
It's south of each

875
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Okay

876
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Oh, bass is covered

877
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Sure, respond

878
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
It's Adam and Curry dot com

879
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,200
And it's still going to quite figure out what's wrong with my email

880
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,200
I am able to get email and download stuff

881
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Through the web naced version of my email server

882
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
But for some reason

883
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,200
I don't know, I just can't get it with my email

884
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I'll leave don't worry

885
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
You can always leave a comment

886
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
It's at www.curry.com

887
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,200
And tomorrow there will be certainly another source code

888
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
