16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

27

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I do apologize for the radio silence.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Or should we say the pod silence?

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's been a crazy ass week.

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I've got lots to talk about.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh.

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's got mashups.

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Got, uh, pod safe tunes.

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Got plenty of promos and plenty of stuff to talk about.

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I mean, Miami right now.

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Or actually, it's still officially say it's South Beach.

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Miami Beach, FLA.

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sitting in the lovely Lowe's hotel.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's a never state app before, but it's actually quite nice.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And outside, it's about 152 degrees.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's crazy.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The time now is 1015, local time, PM.

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And man has a lot happened.

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The iTunes launch would be the top of the list.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
iTunes, of course, featuring pod casting.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It has really opened up the tremendous amount of opportunity.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
A tremendous amount of discussion and shit loads of bandwidth.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, yeah.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going to tell you about some of the things we've been doing regarding the bandwidth.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,280
It's all you're suffering from the day

148
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,680
Easy to feel like a fool

149
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:32,240
Here we can ask for water, we can leave y'all mad.

150
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:40,240
We can ask for water, we can all y'all like the mine.

151
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,240
As long as we have the hell of a loser never think of a hell of a fight.

152
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,240
I see you, we can ask for water, we can leave y'all mad.

153
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,240
We can ask for water, we can all y'all like the mine.

154
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,240
We can ask for water, we can all y'all mad.

155
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
We can ask for water, we can all y'all mad.

156
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
We can ask for water, we can all y'all mad.

157
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,240
We can ask for water, we can all y'all mad.

158
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
We can ask for water, we can all y'all mad.

159
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,240
We can all y'all mad.

160
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
We can all y'all mad.

161
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
We can all y'all mad.

162
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,240
We can all y'all mad.

163
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,240
We can all y'all mad.

164
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:38,560
Oh man, DJBC is out of his mind. Crazy 80s. That was probably more a mega mix than a mashup,

165
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,600
but I loved it so much during all those tunes one after another. It's really, really cool. Nice to hear

166
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,440
my bit in there from, well I mustn't have a couple weeks ago when I played a DJBC mashup,

167
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,960
so let's definitely hand out a Boeing to DJBC. My goodness, okay, let's just bring it down a

168
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,640
notch or two. Let me rewind to, and by the way you can hear the air conditioner rolling in the

169
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,280
background, which is very necessary right now. It literally is like 110 degrees. It's cool down now,

170
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:17,040
as I said, it's like, well, after that DJBC mix, we're 10, 25. So I flew in from,

171
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,440
came from Portland, so let me back up, you know, this whole, well you probably wrote

172
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,240
on my weblog by now, and that I got my, my PPL, my private pilot license for fixed wing.

173
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,680
I kind of did it backwards, where I started off with helicopter. I've had a helicopter license

174
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,160
for two years, and have flown 700 or 800 hours on helicopters. And most people, you know, go for

175
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,720
fixed wing license first, so regular airplane, and then go to helicopter kind of as an add-on, so

176
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,680
I did it in the reverse manner. And this is something that had been planned for, oh God,

177
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,560
eight or nine, at least six months, we're probably closer to eight months, that we go to Portland.

178
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,000
We do a couple days of, you know, training on a Sessner 172, which is the four-seater

179
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,600
150 horsepower, single-engine light airplane, and I basically been training on the Sessner 182RG.

180
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,960
We know what that stands for, don't we? Yes indeed, you're tractable gear. And I just felt,

181
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,800
you know, as things were drawing me, I didn't know that the things would heat up, and

182
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,880
podger would heat up, and that the iTunes launch would be right upon us. I didn't know any of that

183
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,440
stuff, of course, when I booked this entire trip. And as that all junior and drew closer together,

184
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,440
and I knew, and I couldn't talk about it, because we were sworn as secrecy, which I think

185
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,200
it's unfortunate. I couldn't talk about the release. I knew that it was going to be on the 28th,

186
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,720
but I'd promise not to tell anyone, because Apple wanted to do a big launch, a big surprise launch.

187
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,520
In hindsight, I think it would have been better for everybody if we had kind of known about it,

188
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,200
because the deal was, and this is something that I had agreed with Steve Jobs, I would create,

189
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,880
you know, this pod finder podcast, which you're probably seeing now in iTunes,

190
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,680
which will be a weekly feature. We're leaving it on for about, you know, up until next week,

191
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,080
I guess, because so many people still have to upgrade, and you know, slowly all the new iTunes versions

192
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,560
are coming online, and the whole intention of this of the pod finder podcast is to kind of be like,

193
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,760
I modeled it quite honestly after a bit after talk soup. Remember that talk soup? The red

194
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,720
canier was doing on E, not so much the dry humor, because I don't have any of his humor. I think

195
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,960
the gray canier can be a very funny guy in a very cynical way, and of course, he's a great actor,

196
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,160
it turns out. But when he's doing talk soup, you know, you talk about what was on a show,

197
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,120
and then play a clip, and so that's exactly what I want to do with this and try to highlight

198
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,760
anywhere from 15 to 20 pod casts a week, and the deal that we made was that, okay, what we'll do

199
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,920
is we'll feature all these podcasts in the 30 to 40 minutes show, definitely don't want to go

200
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,960
over 40 minutes. We know that's a great time, you know, for a complete podcast. And thinking that

201
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,840
the way it would work, and of course, the way it does work is when you're looking at it in iTunes,

202
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,920
the artwork chains will change as long with each podcast I'm talking about, you click on it,

203
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,640
and then you can go to that page within iTunes, and then preview the show if you want to or

204
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:24,160
subscribe to it directly. And so, you know, we approached everybody that I wanted to feature,

205
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,520
you know, everything from the GM podcast to father, road-rick to a couple of our own pod shows,

206
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,080
so just, you know, all kinds of stuff in there, and we approached everyone and said, look, you know,

207
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,120
we want to feature you, but we're thinking that the bandwidth is going to be a pretty big deal,

208
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,800
so we have to help you out, and we'll, you know, put your shows on a on a server temporarily,

209
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,080
and we had come up with a agreement that at least for the first six weeks, while, you know,

210
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,760
we don't have a content or didn't have a content delivery network, or certainly just about

211
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,760
had enough bandwidth for the pod show, for the pod squad, that Apple would optimize them,

212
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,000
so that they would have a guaranteed delivery, and would be a good experience for everybody,

213
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,600
and that kind of got messed up through no, you know, just through a whole bunch of circumstances,

214
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,840
so we got caught with our pants down when the new iTunes was released, and everybody,

215
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,440
and the grandma started trying to get the pod gas off of our server, was just when my

216
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,080
collapsed almost immediately, we couldn't even if we tried to restart it, it would come up,

217
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,800
and a million hits and requests were becoming in simultaneously, so it would just freeze,

218
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,040
you know, we couldn't do anything, so we were scrambling, and, and this was happening,

219
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,440
it exactly the same time when I was, you know, supposed to be training for my flight,

220
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,520
and the only way to get my pilot's license was to train incessantly and just go add it over and

221
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,200
over and over again, I think I flew in, in four days time, I must have done about 15 hours worth

222
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,760
of pure hardcore training, and actually by the second day, it all clicked, it all clicked

223
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,120
to my head and just like, you know, like I am in a car or in a helicopter, I had total control,

224
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,440
it felt good, and then it was just a matter of getting the experience and just going through

225
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,760
procedures, really, is what it is, because once you can fly an airplane, it's pretty amazing,

226
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,920
it's not that hard, it really isn't, you have to, you know, there's a lot of stuff that has to be

227
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,280
just automatic, you know, particularly emergency procedures, and so all this was going on,

228
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,160
I really had to focus on it, boom, you know, iTunes is exploding, and luckily we have,

229
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,680
we have a couple of people working for us now, which is great, Brian Longus, that was doing most of the

230
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,760
work, and my God, poor guy, he just had his third kid, he's moving to a new house, and he was,

231
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,920
he has been doing all the infrastructure stuff for us, so, you know, he had to get servers in,

232
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:01,280
and the secondary and tertiary, 100 megabit pipes, and setting up stuff with Akamai at the same time,

233
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,520
just a handle of a load, and so it was really nasty for about two or three days there, and it seems

234
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,880
to have, we have a handle on it, we have a control on it, so the, the podcasts are now downloading,

235
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,320
and the sites are up and running again, and it was just, what a surprise, I mean also,

236
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,520
we had worked with Chris McIntyre podcast Ali to make sure that basically anything,

237
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,360
anyone who's registered with podcast Ali would automatically have an iTunes feed that you could then

238
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,200
use to submit into iTunes if you weren't in the directory, and, of course, we met our directory

239
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,680
available, just so much stuff, and, you know, it's going to take another few weeks to shake everything

240
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,000
out, and the directories, you know, it's, we need some cleanup, you know, so we're working on all

241
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that now as we speak, so it was just the timing could not have been worse, but I was so happy

242
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,720
that everybody basically covered for me, and just let me go and do my thing, which I really,

243
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:10,000
really appreciate, because I'm no scholar, I, you know, I went to college for exactly 2.7 months

244
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,360
and learning anything for me is, you know, particularly when it comes to the book work, and if you

245
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,080
look at the, you know, the stuff you have to know, there's some, some real learning that has to

246
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,240
take place there, and it was just, it was cool to be able to do it, and man, when I do something,

247
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:32,080
I like to take it all the way, so hey, I'm really excited, and as I want to thank Frank Harlow,

248
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,360
of course, who was our instructor at Willamette Aviation in Portland, also want to thank John

249
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,920
Strauss, who did the mock check ride, boy, he really put me through the ringer, so essentially,

250
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,200
you know, before you get your real check ride with the official FAA examiner, then, you know,

251
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,800
you go up and you get a pretend test, oh boy, you know, all kinds of wacky shit, at the put on

252
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,560
something they call foggles, which essentially gives you only a view of your instrument panel,

253
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:08,400
so if you should run into real inclement weather, it's kind of a precursor to your instrument flying,

254
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,000
which is a whole other add-on to the license, which of course I do want to get, but, you know,

255
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,360
let's fly a little bit in the, in a nice weather first off, emergency procedures, you know,

256
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,760
all that stuff, and you know, really have to know all the systems in the aircraft and know a lot

257
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:31,200
about the aerodynamics, and then the FAA examiner came up, and, you know, coming from a country

258
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,520
where the, or from the continent, basically, in Europe, where you either have the CAA and the UK,

259
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:48,160
or you have the, the RLD, which is now the I, what is it, what are they, the, uh, for Kirswantza,

260
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,840
I can't remember, uh, whoever the FAA is, and that one's I'm spacing on it for a second, you know,

261
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,720
those guys are really hard noses, and they come in with their, you know, the three-piece suits,

262
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,280
and, you know, this guy Lee, he was, he was just fucking cool man, you know, he came in,

263
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,360
and he asked me all the questions, but he made me feel really at home, and, you know, comfortable,

264
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,520
and it turns out he'd been to Woodstock, the first Woodstock, so we chatted about that,

265
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,000
and, uh, so we went up to the check ride, it wasn't by far, uh, the best flying I've done,

266
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,400
it's certainly, my landings didn't deserve any beauty prize, but that's kind of what you,

267
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,440
what you can expect, you know, it never is your best flying your check ride, um, and, uh,

268
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,520
but it was great, you know, so I got my ad on, and I couldn't be happier, and it was cool,

269
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,880
um, I think at three o'clock, uh, we landed, and we're just finishing up the paperwork,

270
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,800
three, thirty Doug K, from IT Conversations called, you know, Doug and I flew from, uh,

271
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,600
from Seattle to San Francisco, and his bananas after nomdex, and he knew that I was doing the check

272
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,560
ride, he called me up and it was really sweet, and so he wanted to hard-gone, and it was, uh, it was cool.

273
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,200
So that, uh, was, oh, and of course, in Portland itself, um, I hooked up with Ken Clark,

274
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,240
who you've probably heard on the MTV Chronicles, if not, on the Ken and Squip Show, another fine podcast,

275
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,120
you'd want to check out, uh, Ken used to work at MTV for many, many years. He was my personal assistant,

276
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,720
then ran a major portion of the operations at, uh, at the previous company that Ron and I had called

277
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,880
thinking new ideas, um, and he's now, um, selling real estate in, uh, in Portland, and he's also an active

278
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,360
member of the Portland Podcast Association, and I really wish that I'd gone to the meeting,

279
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,880
which was on Thursday, last Thursday, which was also Ken's birthday, which of course I'd promptly

280
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,160
forgotten. Uh, so I do hope to come back again, spend some more time with Ken also go to the Portland

281
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,560
Podcast Association, because I was blown away. I was really, uh, importantly, it's beautiful, um,

282
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,160
the surroundings are beautiful, the people are beautiful. Uh, it's great to, you know, just to see

283
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,960
the scenery where you have Mount Hood, and then, of course, there's Mount St. Helens off in the distance,

284
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,200
and I really do plan on going back. If not for my instrument rating, definitely to go hang out,

285
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,520
so it was good seeing him again. It was kind of funny, um, with all this going on, I hadn't really

286
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,640
paid much attention to, uh, to live eight, and when I was at Ken's on, um, was it Saturday, uh,

287
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,560
he was going to take me to the airport, uh, I called home Patricia and Ken knows Patricia very well,

288
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,440
because he worked from, uh, office in our house for, uh, for a couple of years, and they're really

289
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,480
good friends, and so he was talking to her, and she said, oh, you're not watching live eight,

290
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,800
because, you know, of course he was in the UK, so she was watching a much earlier, and I got to tell you,

291
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:38,240
this may not be a very popular, uh, um, position that I have on this live aid, but it doesn't feel

292
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,200
right to me, you know, I think that, here's what I say, you know, the, the problems in Africa

293
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,400
are not just because it's warm, and, you know, it's a jungle, you know, there's, there's some

294
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,760
serious economic issues, and yes, this was awareness to get the, you know, the G8, the big eight,

295
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,480
to pay attention, and saying that we're not going to take it anymore, but I think that we have to,

296
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,640
you know, it somehow just felt like a big eighties reunion show to me, you know, and, and, you know,

297
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,160
maybe if, if half the people who performed wouldn't wear diamonds, you know, that would solve a big

298
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,440
portion of it, and, you know, I don't know, I just have very, very mixed feelings about about

299
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,880
benefit shows, and yes, it may make you, and I feel good to feel that we're doing something,

300
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,440
but I just really have to wonder how much we're really doing. It's not about money, you know,

301
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:32,720
it's about how money is spent, how it's appropriated, what happens with it, and also economics,

302
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,720
you know, what are the, what are the sanctions, what are the trade tariffs,

303
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,720
certain goods coming from, from African countries, and also you can't see it as one country,

304
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,320
you know, it's a whole mess of countries, a continent, there's a whole bunch of countries with

305
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,200
different leaders, and there's like many countries, there's lots of corruption, and, you know,

306
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,360
Shapoban hats off to Sir Bob, and everybody who did that, but, you know, I think that we really

307
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,760
have to make a political move, a very political move, you know, we can get Bob Gold off to be

308
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,640
president of some country, you know, then maybe, maybe we can, we can make a difference, but

309
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,080
as I said, you know, when I hear all this, you know, it's about, oh, it's a cool pink

310
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,960
Floyds reuniting, and the Spice Girls aren't new reuniting, and status quo can't get on the bill,

311
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,680
and who is on the bill, and I don't know, it's just, I got some mixed feelings about that, but

312
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,680
it doesn't matter. So, not a goodness, I have so much more to talk about, let me talk about

313
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:35,120
Casplaster for a second, because the same day that I did, daily source code episode 200 as the

314
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,400
closing keynote for nomdex, Casplaster, the public beta was released, you can go to castblaster.com.

315
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,600
This podcast is being recorded on Casplaster, as we speak. In fact, I even have the, an older

316
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,760
beta, which is, this I think is beta number 16 and beta 17 is the public one, and you're free to

317
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,760
use it, for as long as you want, as long as your podcast, I think, is an over 10 minutes,

318
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,760
that's the restriction we're putting on, and by the way, you do quite a podcast in 10 minutes,

319
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,760
and so I think that'll be, be freely available for as long as you want to use it, and if you want to

320
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,000
upgrade and buy the full version, which, of course, will also entitle you to the 1.0 release.

321
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,280
It's a 50 bucks, you can order it right online, and I'm getting a lot of great response,

322
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,560
people seem to really like it. I love it. I have my Mac here, and I don't have my regular setup.

323
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,760
When I'm at home, I like to have my compressor limiter, I've got my big honk and microphone,

324
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,600
I've got the preamps, I've got everything all set up, and then I use Megaseg to line up the show.

325
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,520
But on the road, just to get stuff going, you know, a cast blaster is great. I'm using the

326
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,360
lava layer microphone, but it has the built-in compressor limiter that we've talked about before,

327
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,440
and I'm really digging it. If you just want to make a podcast, create an MP3 file,

328
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,400
and actually you can configure it to automatically FTP it up to whatever server you choose.

329
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,520
I think it's a great product, and let's you do all the tags you need, the picture, your artwork

330
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,200
gets put in there. There's even a spot for show notes, and the next step, of course,

331
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,560
will be the connection to the pod show services so that when you hit publish, it actually creates

332
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,080
your show blog from your show notes and creates your podcast feed, which is an RSS 2.0

333
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,080
within closures. As the enclosure uploads everything and you're done, so that'll be the next version,

334
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,560
and you can look forward to that castblaster.com. Give me some feedback. Let me know what you think about it.

335
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:41,680
Okay, so by now, of course I'm trying to get home. I had to take two flights from Portland to

336
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,520
get to Miami. Ron is back in Miami. He was out in San Francisco for four weeks, the reason for

337
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,760
which we'll be able to make some damage announcements about, if not at the end of the week, the

338
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,800
beginning of next week, and we plan tomorrow, which will be July 4th, we'll do a strategy cast,

339
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,720
and we'll be together and we'll have some time, and we have done plenty of strategy. He was

340
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,360
living out of a suitcase that was packed for like five days, it was there for four weeks, so we've been

341
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,000
really going at it, and working hard, and it looks like we're going to set up pod show headquarters

342
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,280
in San Francisco, very excited about that, so I'll be rackin' up plenty of frequent flyer miles.

343
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,720
In fact, I was trying to get home, and really no flights available, as you can imagine for

344
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:30,080
today in tomorrow, so I was able to get a flight on Virgin Atlantic for the fifth, which was

345
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:39,280
a Tuesday, and it's funny because you can't pay for flights if you're in the States going anywhere

346
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,720
from the States to any other, well, if you're flying in the States, you cannot use a credit card

347
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,280
that has a building address that is outside of the U.S., which is a, quote, security measure,

348
00:29:51,280 --> 00:30:00,080
to me, it's like fucking lame, so you have to take the extra fee of using the phone service,

349
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,960
and you don't get your 750 free miles for using the online service, but okay, so I'll live with

350
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,920
that. So I called up, and I talked to a nice young lady who helped me out with the reservation,

351
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:19,680
and at the end of the conversation said, I just have to ask you, you, the Adam Curry from MTV,

352
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,760
and I said, yeah, that would be the one, but that was a long time ago, she said, well, you know,

353
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm old now. Yeah, indeed, thank you very much. She said, you know, I just got an iPod,

354
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,880
and I saw, you know, your podcast thing, your pod find your thing, and it looks really cool,

355
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,440
and I'm really excited about it. I was like, wow, you know, it's really spreading. The virus is a

356
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,280
spread. Hey there, I'm Big Rock, it's a measure of walkie-talkie for a moment. I'm not crashing

357
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:59,680
my editing software. Oh yeah, we got some pro action. Let me play another pro. I got a couple

358
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,080
of them here, so I just wanted to run through some stuff that I'd found. Let me see where's the other

359
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,720
one I wanted to play. It was this one. That's not the one. I'm sorry. It was this one.

360
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,240
Hey, this is Barry Coral, and I've got a new podcast, Call of Confessions of the New

361
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,240
New Girl, and I'm going to be talking about my cleaning record, Confessions of the New

362
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,120
Girl, and my novella of the same name. You can subscribe to it at BarryCoral.com. That's

363
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:35,200
B-A-R-I-K-O-R-A-L. Thanks for checking it out. Wow, we'll soften the volume there, Barry. Now, Barry Coral, of course,

364
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,320
we've played on the source code. We've played some of her pod safe music, BarryCoral.com,

365
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,120
and she now has a podcast. It's great. It's catching on. It really is. I think that there's some

366
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,680
stuff that we can do. There's a lot of discussion about how iTunes is doing podcast. I think we have

367
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:01,120
some cool hybrid things that we can do together. By the way, just so you know, there's a new version

368
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,080
of iPod Element, which is out, which is version 2.1. It's got a lot of awesome features

369
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,520
that you definitely need to check out. It's good to see that we have support from developers

370
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:18,080
on all sides of this. When I get back home, so that'll be Wednesday, so either probably Thursday,

371
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,640
I want to start talking about how we can use Bitcoin to solve a lot of these bandwidth issues,

372
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:34,160
because I saw so many podcasts go offline within two hours just because people have,

373
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,840
they've got accounts where you get x amount of gigabytes transferred per month as all kinds of

374
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,160
quotas, and you get a whole bunch of people. And by the way, subscriptions through the MF and roof.

375
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,920
I mean, it is just outrageous how many new listeners have come in. We talk about the 100 million

376
00:32:51,920 --> 00:33:00,080
listener March. It is definitely, definitely on the move. So I think that, let me just tell you

377
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,320
the way I think it should work. And then hopefully, as I wade through the the shitloads of email that

378
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,760
I have, I now have officially 6,261 red messages. If you send something to me, you haven't heard

379
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,920
from me in like a week or two, you're going to have to send it again. That's going to be this

380
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:25,840
smartest thing. Unless, of course, it's an MP3 file for a podsafe, music, or a mashup, or a promo.

381
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,040
As always in the show notes where I link to anything that's been played or anything that we've

382
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,080
talked about, the email address is to send off your program is submit at podshow.com, podsafe

383
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,640
music tune instead of the podsafe at podshow.com and mashups off to mashup at podshow.com.

384
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,040
That also, by the way, is where you can submit to be on the serious show, which is going great guns

385
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:53,120
getting amazing feedback from from lots of serious satellite listeners. So there's another

386
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,920
area where you can promote your podcast, which actually will cost you no bandwidth at all.

387
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,800
Last get over to tardthumbs.com. He's at little tips and little tricks you're looking for.

388
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,400
Let me tell you something, Charlie George, he's going to tell y'all about these things.

389
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,320
He keeps up with gaming and gaming news and all things you want to know.

390
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,720
Charlie's going to talk to everybody and ask him what the little tips and tricks are that they know.

391
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,440
If it's actually into, he'll tell y'all about it. He'll talk to people that are all into.

392
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,400
So you get your game playing honey and those without a tardthumbs.com.

393
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,000
Hey, this is Richard Tyler at the fruit. You'll see you.

394
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,960
Yo DJ, are you done? Next time you're.

395
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

396
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,720
It's a gift from me, but it's all right. Yeah.

397
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,440
Wow, shit. Hold on a second. I messed that up.

398
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,160
Oh my god, I was so perfect home. Let me, let me reload that.

399
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,400
Let's try that again. You took it from me, but it's all right. Yeah.

400
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Well, you took it from me and I'm feeling bad, but it's all right.

401
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,440
Yeah, well, the love that you give. Yeah, girl, my goodbye.

402
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,880
Oh, you're dressed that I pay. Yeah, hey.

403
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,840
We're little too hard. Wow.

404
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,480
When I go up, I wanna be a fucking stroller.

405
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,120
When I grow up, I wanna be a fucking stroller.

406
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,440
When I go up, I wanna be a fucking stroller.

407
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,440
And I go up, I wanna be a fucking soldier

408
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Baby, I'm ready to get from me

409
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
It's alright, yeah, yeah

410
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Yeah, all that you give

411
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Yeah, girl

412
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,440
And I can buy, I can buy, I can buy

413
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
The price that I pay

414
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Hey, hey

415
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
A little too high, no too high

416
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,440
When I grow up, I wanna be a fucking soldier

417
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,440
When I grow up, I wanna be a fucking soldier

418
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,440
When I grow up, I wanna be a fucking soldier

419
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,440
When I grow up, I wanna be a fucking soldier

420
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,440
When I grow up, I wanna be a fucking soldier

421
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,440
When I go up, I wanna be a fucking soldier

422
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,440
When I grow up, I wanna be a fucking soldier

423
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,440
When I grow up, I can't be a fucking soldier

424
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Anything music on the source code

425
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
When I grow up

426
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
I want to be what was that at the very end?

427
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Almost second.

428
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
That sounded like the end of the source code.

429
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Hold on let me just cast Blasters so cool for this.

430
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Let me just drag that to the end.

431
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Let me see what the end was there.

432
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
That's right.

433
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Thought it was.

434
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
Fantastic.

435
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
Three, two, one.

436
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
It's time for the hit to go.

437
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
With Y.

438
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Hey, I'm.

439
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Hey, I'm.

440
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
How you doing?

441
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
I was just hit just 46.

442
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Boating the public better of cast Blasters better number 17.

443
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Excellent.

444
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
And this hit test is a themed version.

445
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
So I guess you'll figure it out.

446
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Okay.

447
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,440
Number one.

448
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Oh, of course.

449
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Oh, Yon.

450
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Oh, so right on, man.

451
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,440
Oh, what Yon doesn't know is that I'm a big fan of this guy.

452
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,440
This is Luther Vandross, man.

453
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
This is a theme of Luther Vandross.

454
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
That is any love.

455
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
I know that.

456
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Oh, my goodness.

457
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
He passed away.

458
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
And this is number two.

459
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Hey.

460
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
I interviewed him a while ago.

461
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
I'll talk about it after.

462
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
I know all of them.

463
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Yon, you could have known that.

464
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
But that's here and now.

465
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,440
I know every single Luther Vandross song known to man, I think.

466
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
And third and final one.

467
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
That's stop to love.

468
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,440
I'm just going to shut up and listen to the answer because it's such beautiful music.

469
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,440
Well, if you haven't figured it out yet, this is a theme version as a tribute to Luther Vandross

470
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,440
who died last Friday at age 54.

471
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,440
This is answer number one.

472
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
It's any love.

473
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I speak to myself sometimes.

474
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,440
And I say no more.

475
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,440
In a lot of ways you're a little kid.

476
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,440
And if anybody's there.

477
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Well, if anybody's there.

478
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
And if you don't.

479
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
And if you don't.

480
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
And if you don't.

481
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,440
And if you don't.

482
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
And if you don't.

483
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
And if you don't.

484
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
And if you don't.

485
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
And if you don't.

486
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,440
And if you don't.

487
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,440
And if you don't.

488
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Any love. Luther Vandross.

489
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,440
And this is answer number two.

490
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Also, it's my Luther.

491
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
This is here and how.

492
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:24,440
One, look in your eyes and bear a seed

493
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Just what do you mean to me?

494
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:40,440
You and I are promised to love faith for me

495
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:55,440
You and I are promised to be one with me

496
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:07,440
You and I are promised to love faith for me

497
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Beautiful balance

498
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Luther with here and now and this is ancient number three

499
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,440
It's stopped to love

500
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:52,440
You and I are promised to love faith for me

501
00:41:52,440 --> 00:42:05,440
You and I are promised to love faith for me

502
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Stop to love Luther Vendros and there's one answer missing and that's the answer to one of the bigger hits

503
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,440
I couldn't use it as a clip because I used it already in hit press number four

504
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:23,440
I think it's never too much the biggest hits he's ever had Luther Vendros never too much

505
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,440
And now and this is from New England

506
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:55,440
I just don't want to stop all my love

507
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:03,440
I'm new young days in your mountains and your clouds in your eyes

508
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,440
I just don't want to stop that never too much

509
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:16,440
And this concludes my little tribute to this great singer, songwriter, producer and performer

510
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,440
That is going to be made certainly by me

511
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,440
I think I've got almost every album ever released by him

512
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,440
So I went to two of his concerts in the Netherlands here in Rotterdam

513
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,440
And way back when I heard a R&B and soul show on local radio

514
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,440
I played a lot of his songs so it's the influence of my...

515
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Yeah my thing with music a lot

516
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,440
And of course I was also shocked by his death because he's only 54 minutes of shame

517
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
Well I hope you enjoyed this hit test

518
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,440
I guess I will be spending some time on this topic in the next hit test podcast as well

Well I guess hit test number 47

526
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Bye bye

527
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Thank you very much John

528
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Perfect

529
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Perfect

530
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:33,440
It's interesting because I was thinking about doing a little tribute to Luther myself

531
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,440
But you know, didn't quite know how to do it, you know, can you play?

532
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,440
Obviously you can't play a licensed song

533
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,440
I figured it'd be okay but I was so happy when I heard this kick in

534
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
I too

535
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,440
No just about every single Luther Vandro song

536
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,440
And that is my background when I was a disjockey on decibel radio and Amsterdam Pirate radio station

537
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
That was in the early 80s man

538
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,440
We played and of course we were playing records back then

539
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,440
We played those records until they were gray

540
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
I'm telling you

541
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Great loss

542
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,440
I met him a couple times in the past of the interview

543
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,440
Just the sweetest guy

544
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Very down to earth

545
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
Very low key

546
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,440
He hasn't been healthy for a long long time

547
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,440
Of course he had a stroke and he had diabetes

548
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,440
And hypertension and had a lot of weight issues

549
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,440
Up and down, up and down throughout his life

550
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,440
And he will really really be missed

551
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,440
And God damn 54 man that is way too young

552
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,440
Kind of put you in touch with your own mortality and with reality

553
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,440
Okay 45 minutes

554
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
That will definitely have to do it for this source code

555
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,440
Thank you all very much for tuning in to this source code for

556
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,440

Just on the cusp of independence day here in the United States

558
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,440
I'm happy I'll be able to

559
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,440
To be here for the celebrations

560
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,440
Since well as you can understand

561
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,440
It didn't do a lot of that in the UK

562
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,440
I think they celebrate the opposite of that

563
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,440
