00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Shira Charley

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
2 8 9

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We here at Legal Legal Television

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Bring you exclusive live coverage

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of the man versus Adam Curry trial.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We take you now to the courtroom.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey Lars, for the Apple Church,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
on a handgun.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is federal court case

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
1 0 0 0 0 9

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the charge is against the defendant.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Adam Curry is lack of respect for music establishment.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All those Mr. Clay, please.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Your honor, my name is envy,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and I am defending Mr. Curry.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He plays guilty to being correct in his opinion

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
of the music established

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and not guilty for expressing those feelings.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're honor, we find Mr. Curry to be a disruptive force

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to the well-established music industry

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and as the charges read,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
very disrespectful indeed.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We find Mr. Curry to be a disruptive force

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to the well-established music industry

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and as the charges read,

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
very disrespectful indeed.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We'd play for the court the following evidence.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The issue of copyrights that you sign over to them

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
or assign them,

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and we heard about the Dutch Buma Stemera.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We heard about the German Gema,

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and now you're not going to believe this.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is exactly what I was,

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I joked about this happening.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I've choked about it.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, so essentially what is happening here

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
with the European rights organizations

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and so far we know it's the same.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Also, it's for the Dutch, the Germans, and the French.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
When you sign up with their version of Ask Had BMI,

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you are not allowed to give away any other rights to anyone.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So you cannot say to a podcaster,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
hey, go ahead, take my stuff

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and go and play it for free.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That will be a breach of your contract

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
with that rights organization.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's like it's a conundrum, I guess.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So I feel that we need to address this issue.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not quite sure.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Is there one central organization?

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I didn't find it.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I didn't find that it works across all of these rights organizations.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But this is wrong.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I mean, if it's your property,

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
then you should be able to change that license

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
however you want.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think it is a constitutional right

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
of these organizations to be the only one to collect

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
or not collect, I guess.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
On artists' copyright royalties.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's not just what it is.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And with that, you're on a...

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the prosecution rests.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, what does the defense have to say to that?

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Your honor?

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The fact of the matter is...

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the truth hurts.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In addition, the words spoken by Mr. Curry simply reflect

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the feelings of thousands of podcasters

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and millions of listeners across the planet.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I, your honor, and both a podcaster

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and a listener of podcasters.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I serve producer podcasters

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and in bedtime stories my kids love

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and begin listening to podcasters

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and then producing my podcasters

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
do in part to the hard work by the podfather

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Adam Curry.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I for one agree with Mr. Curry

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and believe thousands and thousands of people

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
feel the same way.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Whatever, that number is growing every day, your honor.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The ground swell has just begun.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The tipping point is near.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Your honor, do you want to always be known as the judge

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
that failed to support podcasting?

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I do not think so.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your honor, I employ you to listen to my podcasters

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
bedtime stories my kids love in items.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And your honor, in closing,

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I am speaking for Mr. Curry

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and thousands of podcasters across the world.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Get off our back.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We are not going away.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And with that, your honor, the defense rests.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I am overwhelmed by the compelling evidence

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
presented.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Mr. Curry is obviously disrespectful

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
to the established music industry.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Whatever, in light of the growing audience

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and the obvious following of Adam Curry's opinions

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
indicated by the swelling number of podcasters,

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
both listeners and producers,

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I find Mr. Curry, my guilty.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
strapped to my ass.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm just kidding.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And it's Wednesday.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hello, everybody.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Finally, after weeks of bitching,

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
we've got one.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A Hanukkah holiday pod save music track.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Good morning.

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hanukkah, I know it's going to be all right.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Everyone's together tonight.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Feeling good, it's Hanukkah.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Two candles left.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The holidays just begun.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We're in for lots of fun.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The time has come, it's Hanukkah.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sun and sun.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Your home is fast as it can.

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Put the oil into the ground.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a common joy.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why do you call?

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
As we are not good friends.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's true.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Rock up here.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
For the wind from our town.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's nice to have them around.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Even though he's weird, it's Hanukkah.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sailors cool.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But Hanukkah hares the man.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So come and join our long good plan.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We'll save you and play this Hanukkah.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sun and sun.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Your home is fast as it can.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Put the oil into the ground.

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a common joy.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Rock up here.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sun and sun.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Your home is fast as it can.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Put the oil into the ground.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a common joy.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Rock up here.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sun and sun.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Rock up here.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All right.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Enough people sent me that one.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you very much from the pod save music network.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The very first holiday Hanukkah song.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sure we're more to follow.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We missed Ramadan, but maybe next year we'll catch up on that.

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey, everybody.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
How you doing?

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Welcome to the daily source code.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm back in the studio at the Curry Cottage in Gilford, United Kingdom.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Here for another week or so before I head off to San Francisco.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
One more time before Christmas.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
For a number of things.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Man, man, man, man, man.

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's been so busy last night.

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I had a really, a lot of seconds.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let me just make sure.

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I found this.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think it's better.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a little bit better.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I got to work on this.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I didn't sleep very well last night for a number of reasons.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The first is that yesterday was another one of those 16 hour days where, you know, I was,

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I, you know, I get up.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yesterday we did the cruiser cast and around four o'clock.

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's when San Francisco wakes up.

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Everyone was back from a long holiday.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thanksgiving weekend.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And lots of calls.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And actually, I got really excited about some of the conversations we had yesterday.

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We had everybody in the office on it.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I was on it.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I call in on a conference call or Skype.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Sometimes I do video depending on where, however, you know, we have multiple ways of connecting.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And we had everybody.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We had software engineers.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We had designers.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We had promotion marketing, sales, accounting, controller, finance, operations.

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And of course, what we're going through is the couple of initiatives, the audition, which

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
will be hearing more about very soon.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The podcast, the Pod Show podcast, delivery network, which we're also going to tell you about

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
very soon.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I mean, really in detail, we'll unleash some announcements about that.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes, damn announcements coming.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And really how everything all kind of fits together.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And how podcasters who are interested can grow their audience.

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And eventually with some luck and a lot of hard work, elbow grease, quit your day job.

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But that wasn't the main reason for my unrest, just because of the excitement and, you know,

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
my brain still spinning by the time it hit the pillow.

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I just kept on going and going.

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I'm not quite sure.

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I tried to explain to Patricia this morning.

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Actually, the minute I woke up, I said, oh, Matt is sleep very well.

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And here's why.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And she understood it very well.

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It has to do with negativity and positivity.

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's a rollercoaster ride that I witnessed every single day online.

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There's something about the human nature.

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And I'm not quite sure what it is, but it is without a doubt human nature.

209
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
First of all, everybody lives in their own reality.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I have my reality.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This moment, my reality is completely different from yours.

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're in a different place.

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're in a different head space.

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You're thinking of different things.

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And by the way, you are the center of the universe of your universe.

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I'm the center of my universe.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And when these universes start to collide, that's when interesting things happen.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And one of the most interesting things that happens with this incredible growth of communications that we've seen

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
is that people who rise to the top get kicked down.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Or there's people ready to kick them down or drag them down.

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There's other people who are willing to push them back up based upon that dragging down.

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's why I say this roller coaster.

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's almost like a yo-yo effect.

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can see great examples of this, for example, on podcastali.com in the forums where people are talking about pod show.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can see this happening with Google now.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Remember Google?

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Remember when it was the coolest shit and we loved it and it was fantastic.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And these guys were finally doing the right thing.

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, now it seems if you listen to the noise and the signal to noise ratio or something you've got to look out for.

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It seems that Google's evil, all of a sudden, particularly the people who said they would do no evil.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And when that's kind of baseless, most of this is baseless, but it's based upon someone else's reality of the situation.

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And that's how you read an article, how stories told to you, how you read an article is different from how it's written.

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There are all these things that kind of fit together.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And one thing that Patricia and I really learned when we moved to the Netherlands and just before the millennium, 1999, the end of the year,

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
is that this is really propelled.

236
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And it is a direct result, I think, of so many people being able to have their voice heard, which is great.

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I mean, I love that.

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But it comes somewhere, this is what Patricia's take on it.

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And I should get her in here to talk about that. Maybe we'll do that tomorrow, we'll have a broader discussion.

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm just kind of brain farting at the moment.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's not necessarily people who spew negativity or flame.

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There's lots of people like comic strip blogger on thecurry.com comments, the same deal.

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I think that if someone is unhappy about their own universe, regardless of what that problem is,

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and you see someone else who apparently is happy, then there's this automatic humor.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I do it too, by the way, everyone does this.

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You want to say, ah, you know, screw them and you just lash out at somebody.

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And having been a known figure for a long time, I've learned to deal with this.

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But it has gotten really, really intense, which means a couple things to me.

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The first one is we're doing something really good because people are taking notice.

250
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And they're questioning and they're coming up with a lot of conspiracy theories, literally, which is pretty funny to read through.

251
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But just so you know, when you say something in your podcast or write something on your weblog or something's written in an article or, you know, if you send an email, it does hurt.

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I mean, it really does, which is, which, of course, is my problem. I let things affect me.

253
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And of course, if someone writes something really nice, then it feels really good.

254
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But the frequency of that is just, it's, the frequency is going up.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So the roller coaster is really, it's vibrating almost.

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And this is why you, I think, why you see celebrities, particularly new celebrities, people who burst onto the scene.

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:15,000
They get the same thing and they get it predominantly from newspapers and magazines and entertainment tonight and all these entertainment based shows and stuff on the internet and pictures.

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's why you see them freak out.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You see them.

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I've rock rock roll stars used to trash hotel rooms.

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I believe it is for this very reason for this, this, this, this weird clashing of universes and positivity and negativity vibrating amongst

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
them all the time. It's, it's a very weird sensation.

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And as I said, I've been in the public eye since I was 19, I still have not gotten used to it.

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But it also has gotten progressively, the frequency has increased progressively over the years with the amount of communications that we have.

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And by the way, you know, let's not, let's not forget that only 10 years ago, no one knew what a fucking cell phone was almost.

266
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You know, this was a luxury item that maybe you had in your car.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You got a card and a cell phone, you got a car phone, text messaging.

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
All of these things combined.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And yeah, I don't know.

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If you have any thoughts about that, I mean, it's, it's got to be something much larger.

271
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It is a part of human nature. I'm not quite sure what it is.

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And I don't take it, you know, well, I do take it personally, but I understand.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I do understand where people are coming from.

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I think that in general, everyone is a nice person.

275
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I think probably another part that.

276
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That had to do with my unrestfulness was my brain processing this fantastic book that I read called God's debris.

277
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's written by Douglas Adams, who is the Gilbert guy.

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's actually available for free on the internet.

279
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can buy a hardbound copy, but he put it out basically in a kind of open source.

280
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Maybe, I don't know if he has creative commas on it, but it's, it's a fantastic book.

281
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's short. It's a great read. Tom Schuiting, who maintains the fabulous Korean vaninkle archive.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
A big archive, a big part of my professional life sent me that.

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And I was just totally blown away by the concept in that book.

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And maybe that has something to do with.

285
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And I don't, I don't really want to get into explaining what the book is about.

286
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But maybe that is something to do with this reverberation of positive and negative energy.

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And perhaps we need the positive and negative energy.

288
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Maybe that's the, the great equalizer.

289
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Maybe it's something that's necessary.

290
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't know. And of course, there was also the foxes who were out in drove last night,

291
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
rummaging through the trash.

292
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
God, that makes so much noise.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're supposed to put your bags out in the morning, which we do.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But someone put their trash out last night.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And then the foxes who, of course, are coming closer to civilization every single day.

296
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So I'm going to go through the trash and make an all kinds of noise.

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But anyway, so I'm awake though.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm feeling pretty good.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I want to thank everybody, by the way, who's participating and contributing to the show notes.

300
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You can always find the show notes.

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I link to the show notes from from the podcast at dailysourcecode.com.

302
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's great because people are now actually embellishing and coming up with their own words as to what's being discussed in the show.

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
For instance, yesterday, 21 minutes, 55 seconds.

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Adam comments that the concept of touchscreen navigation is an odd concept for a pilot.

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Since as a pilot, you never touch your instruments.

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That would be your navigation instruments.

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Since you'll get oily residue on them.

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And then you can't read them at night.

309
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And you'd die in a fiery crash.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So I obviously didn't add the fiery crash part.

311
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But that showed up in the show notes.

312
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That was a nice touch.

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Here's another one.

314
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So he's going to start the show in the parking lot outside of combat.

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And no, the cable he bought wasn't one of those packages.

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You can't open without a plasma torch.

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think I said scissors, but I like the embellishment.

318
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It really works.

319
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And thanks again to everybody who was contributing to the show notes.

320
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think it's a fantastic.

321
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You know, Michael show note.

322
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll call him that.

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Mike show note.

324
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I believe he's trying to start kind of a business or a service for podcasts.

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I support that holy fully.

326
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And I think it's fantastic using a wiki for show notes.

327
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm really, really digging it.

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
A little dismayed actually.

329
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I saw once in a while I checked in on the wiki wiki pedia.

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And I look in podcasting.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Dave and I have almost been written out.

332
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's all these other people who have successfully created podcasting.

333
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And I congratulate you for doing that.

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Thank you very much.

335
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I had a great slow morning though.

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, check out the Potio music rewind episode number 10 is out.

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Kick and ass as always.

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What a fantastic show.

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Give that a listen if you have a chance.

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Hey Adam.

341
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's Swippy from Skepticality.

342
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Hey Swopster.

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I've been catching up on back shows sitting at a borders in downtown Atlanta.

344
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sucking up the coffee and the Wi-Fi while there.

345
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Because it rehabbed during the day.

346
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And low and behold, I hear you talking about my buddy Slaw.

347
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And this new Christmas song.

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It just so happens that our friend,

349
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and musician George Rabb, just finished recording his fifth CD at Slaw's B Sharp Studios

350
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
in Historia, New York.

351
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And to celebrate the release of the CD entitled,

352
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in Terabang, George held a concert at which Slaw appeared and also performed.

353
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Derek and I were supposed to be there.

354
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But since we couldn't make it, George sent us some pictures.

355
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
One of it includes Slaw.

356
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I thought you might enjoy seeing it.

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
George also plays drums on the Christmas song

358
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and contributed some backing vocals as well.

359
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
George says he still gets traffic on his site

360
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and sails of his CDs from the podcast he did with us.

361
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And that was way back in the summer.

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So pot safe music is definitely good for artists.

363
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And it's good for podcasting too.

364
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Skepticality ended up in someone's liner notes.

365
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
How cool is that?

366
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah.

367
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
See you Adam.

368
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
All right, Swopie.

369
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Thank you.

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Say hi to Derek for me, please.

371
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Please hope everything's going well.

372
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And good to hear your voice again.

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Here on the Daily Source Code.

374
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So today I will finally get it done.

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's go to Xmas.podshow.com.

376
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Kicks off today so that by tomorrow the first of December

377
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you'll have a new Christmas song every day

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
right on your computer.

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hey Adam, this is Joe.

380
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is sofa coaches.

381
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I wanted to send you a promo this week.

382
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But when I sat down with the other sofa coaches

383
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and tried to put together some ideas,

384
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
things got a little out of control.

385
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Take a listen and see what happened.

386
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Do you think we should tell them it's only an hour long?

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Absolutely.

388
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, we go a little over an hour.

389
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

390
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I mean, you can't say what how long we're going to do every time.

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Most of the time we shoot for 60 minutes.

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Absolutely.

393
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah, but we always squeeze at least 10,

394
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
15 minutes of going material into that hour.

395
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The most important thing they should know what a sofa coach

396
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
actually is.

397
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't get it because we don't sit on a sofa

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and none of us are coaches.

399
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So what's the story here?

400
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, we are.

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We're slots that know everything.

402
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We're so precodious because we didn't know anything after the fact.

403
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Uh, we do know everything.

404
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's a good point.

405
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah.

406
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You know, another good point to bring up about the show

407
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
is that it's audio only.

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And there's no video feed.

409
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So nobody has to worry about what the original is.

410
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah.

411
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah.

412
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

413
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We don't have a shot.

414
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Then that's for sure.

415
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We all got faces for radio.

416
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Speak for yourself.

417
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
By the way, is there any music on this show?

418
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Every once in a while, we play some pot-safe music.

419
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

420
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But where do we do?

421
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Who cares about the music?

422
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We're sports shows.

423
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We're sports shows.

424
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We're sports shows.

425
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We're sports shows.

426
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We're sports shows.

427
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We're sports shows.

428
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We're sports shows.

429
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
All there you have it at them.

430
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's about how things go when we talk about sports, too.

431
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So be sure to tune in.

432
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You can find this in the iTunes music store.

433
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Just search for sofa coaches.

434
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Or you can go to our website.

435
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Listen.

436
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
True is not false.com.

437
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Adam, please give us a little move.

438
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Pot show.

439
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
No one does chicken like Pot show.

440
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Hey Adam.

441
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's a long time listener of yours.

442
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I go back almost to the very beginning.

443
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I know how you occasionally become irritated with lawyers from time to time.

444
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Don't deny it.

445
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I know it's true and I don't blame you.

446
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's a lawyer myself.

447
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I too become frustrated with lawyers from time to time.

448
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
In fact, it's how I spend almost every single day.

449
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You can probably guess the way I've chosen to work out my frustrations with a legal profession.

450
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's right.

451
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
With a podcast.

452
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The legal underground podcast, which I started in January 2005.

453
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
With a short test episode that you ended up playing in full on your show.

454
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Thanks for that.

455
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Now here we are almost a year later.

456
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I thought it was a good time to check back in and say I'm still out here in the pot of sphere going strong.

457
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Our friends shows every week or two that are either short form called law-related things that suck.

458
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Or a slightly longer form in which I discuss legal news and a little politics.

459
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And in a reverent way that's probably going to have the lawyer police knocking on my door very soon.

460
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Your thing must lawyers wouldn't know a podcast from.

461
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't know.

462
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They're own cold hearts.

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So to conclude, it's the legal underground podcast.

464
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You'll find the feed at my weblog.

465
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Evan Shafers, legal underground at www.legalunderground.com.

466
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Meanwhile, Adam, keep up the great work at the pod safe music network and all your other various projects.

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You know, with all you've got going on, you're a walking full-time employment act for lawyers.

468
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Would it be wrong of me to thank you from the entire profession?

469
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, thank you, Adam.

470
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And if you listen to my show, thanks for tuning in.

471
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Adam Curry Rocks.

472
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Well, actually, in Brazil, Adam Curry Sambas.

473
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Easy.

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
All castors are connected to the daily source code source code.

475
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I so want to go to Brazil.

476
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's not funny.

477
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I've been to a lot of countries, a lot of continents, a lot of places.

478
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I've been very, very fortunate that way.

479
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Never to South America, though.

480
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I definitely want to come to Brazil.

481
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So that is in the medium-term planning.

482
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And I know that there's a huge podcast community cropping up there.

483
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'd love to learn more about it.

484
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So how do you, Brazil?

485
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
How are you doing?

486
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Comersta.

487
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah.

488
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I used to know some Portuguese, which is what they speak in Brazil.

489
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No more.

490
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Hey, for those of you who are new to the daily source code,

491
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
you may have heard of the sound-vertising experiment.

492
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This is where I anchor your thoughts to a certain sound

493
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
or visual and anchor a thought to it.

494
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So what actually started off kind of as an accident,

495
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
every single time I burped.

496
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Senseiho would come into your mind.

497
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Then we moved on to another trick, which I'll do it right now,

498
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
just in case your brand knew.

499
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If you already know what I'm about to do, then close your eyes and

500
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I don't think it'll work either.

501
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Whatever you're doing right now, look at a point where you are.

502
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's maybe a house, maybe a tree, maybe a sign.

503
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It could be the current front of you.

504
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It could be a person.

505
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Now look at that object, Senseiho.

506
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So the concept is, whenever you see that object,

507
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
in fact whenever you even think of that object,

508
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
you'll think of Senseiho.

509
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It works.

510
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I think everyone who was participated in this willingly or unwillingly

511
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
knows that this sound-vertising, this anchoring, this Vulcan mind trick,

512
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
actually does work.

513
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But it has no real benefit, particularly not to me in the Senseiho case

514
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
because Senseiho is not paying me for that.

515
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Now of course I don't mind doing the experiment,

516
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
but today I received an email that completely twisted my mind

517
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
backwards about this and I really love this.

518
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I can't believe I didn't come up with this.

519
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So this is from Mark Zeta who says,

520
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Hey Adam, Senseiho ads are airing here in Australia as well.

521
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So Senseiho now is kicking up their advertising.

522
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
They're kicking it up.

523
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's in the UK, it's in the US.

524
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's of course the Netherlands where it comes from.

525
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's in Australia.

526
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And Mark says, when I saw it, the first thing I thought of

527
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
was the Daily Source Code.

528
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I was expecting either character in the ad to do your trademarks

529
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and say, oh, burp.

530
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I think the sound-vertising could go a long way.

531
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Thanks for your show.

532
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm loving every episode of it.

533
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Mark, okay.

534
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So all of a sudden like,

535
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
No, this is fantastic.

536
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
This is it.

537
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I am now utilizing the ad budget of Senseiho

538
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
to promote the Daily Source Code.

539
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
How freaking cool is that?

540
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And the cool thing is everybody can do it.

541
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So pick a product or pick a service or something

542
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
that's being advertised very, very heavily on television and radio.

543
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Anchor your listeners to it.

544
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And then every single time they hear or see that

545
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
advertisement, they won't be able to help themselves

546
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
but think about your podcast.

547
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
How cool is that?

548
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Tell me if it works.

549
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Happy freaking holidays Senseiho.

550
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This is Natalie Brown,

551
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
wishing the Daily Source Code listeners a safe and happy holiday season.

552
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This is Chris from the Financial Aid podcast.

553
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000

554
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
This is us online at financialadpodcast.com

556
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So by tomorrow, make sure that

558
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm the kid along with Mr. Clean.

560
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And we'd like to wish you and yours a very happy holiday.

561
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Oh, no, no, man. You can't say happy holidays.

562
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Why not? Why can't I say holidays?

563
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Because it's happy, camel to days.

564
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yes, that's right.

565
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We can't say Christmas.

566
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
We can't say holidays.

567
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We can't say how to go.

568
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We can't say quansica.

569
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We've changed it to happy camel to a day.

570
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And we hope everybody has a happy camel to a day.

571
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
To you and yours.

572
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
From Go and Deep with Get in Clean.

573
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Visit the website at www.godeepwith.us.

574
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And have a happy new year.

575
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, man.

576
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
New snow angels rock.

577
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So by tomorrow, make sure you subscribe to the feed at xmus.podshow.com.

578
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So that every single day will be a happy camel to a day for you.

579
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
For the pod save music network, this is Carmen Tyler.

580
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Pick this one up from accident hash.

581
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll be there on camel to a day.

582
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, it's Christmas time again.

583
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
How I miss you.

584
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I wish I hadn't been so far away.

585
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'll be coming home.

586
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,000
How my heart so longs to see your face.

587
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You'll take care of us reminding me of lovers with truth.

588
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So why your patiently waiting to remember this.

589
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'll be there.

590
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'll be there.

591
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Don't see us.

592
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm sorry.

593
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll be there.

594
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'll be there.

595
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll be there in your heart.

596
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh Christmas day.

597
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
How I love this time of year.

598
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Joy and laughter.

599
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The holidays are here.

600
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And I know.

601
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
As this season now begins.

602
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You'll see lovers underneath the mistletoe.

603
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I ought to thank you for having me on.

604
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Children snuggle in the bed.

605
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I waiting for the time.

606
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:31,000
To hear Santa's reindeer from their window right outside.

607
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'll be there.

608
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'll be there.

609
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Though it seems I'm so far away.

610
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll be there.

611
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'll be there.

612
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'll be there in your heart.

613
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh Christmas day.

614
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So here's to you on this holiday.

615
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
May your every wish come true.

616
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You and far away.

617
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:36,000
My heart will be with you.

618
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll be there.

619
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh I'll be there.

620
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Though it seems I'm so far away.

621
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'll be there.

622
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll be there.

623
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'll be there in your heart.

624
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'll be there in your heart.

625
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh Christmas day.

626
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Is it possible?

627
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm falling in love again.

628
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Carmen Tyler.

629
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What a beautiful voice.

630
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll be there in Christmas day.

631
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And my apologies for the pilot error midstream there.

632
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But we landed safely.

633
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
We walked away from the airplanes and that constitutes a good landing.

634
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Apologize.

635
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Hey, speaking.

636
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Of course, it's from the podcast music network.

637
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Potset music.

638
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yep, not best.

639
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The podcast music network.

640
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The podcast music network dot com.

641
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Mike O'Leary sent a wonderful email.

642
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Adam, I was checking out clips of the songs on the candy butcher's album.

643
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Hang on.

644
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Mike in iTunes in the music store after hearing what to do with Michael on your podcast.

645
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Love the song.

646
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Anyway, in the top right corner is a list that says listeners also bought.

647
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That's the recommendation engine.

648
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Look at what's listed and see the power that DSE has to persuade and influence not only one,

649
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
but a multitude of musical talents.

650
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Brother love and the list of these bitties are listed right there with the candy butchers in one swoop.

651
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So the question I have now is when does the Adam Craig recommends playlists go up on the iTunes page?

652
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's interesting idea.

653
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Actually it's a damn good idea.

654
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Hey, let's call the iTunes guys about that.

655
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But that is proof.

656
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That is absolutely proof.

657
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So listening to a podcast music on the podcast actually creates sales.

658
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Gee, what a concept.

659
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I love it.

660
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Time to wrap up the,

661
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Emma the Logitech MM50 naming contest that we'd be doing for the last week or so.

662
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Let me see.

663
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
First one is an audio contest.

664
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So Adam Jason San Diego.

665
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You said you wanted audio comments on the same MM50 instead of the emails.

666
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So I'm going to stop writing you the 10 or 15 a day that I've been sending you.

667
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Hope you need read them on the air.

668
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So I'm going to just give you some ideas I've been thinking about bouncing up the wall.

669
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
See what sticks.

670
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You know, playing that little game.

671
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
MM50.

672
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Let's see.

673
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Music maker.

674
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Music box.

675
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Music.

676
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Music with two ends.

677
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
How about the,

678
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
My personal favorite.

679
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The eye match with two ends.

680
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So it's image not to be confused with eye match.

681
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Or we could just call it the 501.

682
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Any of you.

683
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Give me a call.

684
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We'll do lunch.

685
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah.

686
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Call my people.

687
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Okay.

688
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Well, yeah.

689
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Thank you for the feedback.

690
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
No, I think the winner and it was really close because I really like the port of

691
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Potty, the port iPod.

692
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I thought that was good, but it may not be.

693
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I don't know.

694
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's a great name, but maybe not quite as commercial because there already is a port of

695
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Potty, and that could create all kinds of problems.

696
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But I think Greg Milligan sent in a really good one.

697
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Greg is from Coventry, which I, yeah, presumed to be the UK.

698
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah, Coventry.

699
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And he says, perhaps the MM50 should be referred to as the sound slab.

700
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I like that.

701
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The sound slab.

702
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That sounds, that's nothing to do with MM50, but I do like it is.

703
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's a slab of sound.

704
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So Greg, congratulations.

705
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Send me your address.

706
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I will send you an MM50.

707
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It might even be my personal one.

708
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I hope we have another one left.

709
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Everyone like walked off with these, the minute they were in the office.

710
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Okay.

711
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
What you heard briefly during Carmen Tyler's wonderful Christmas song was some feedback,

712
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
which is very long.

713
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm not going to play all of it from Eric.

714
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And he has something interesting to say.

715
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's about feed, hijacking.

716
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So if you're a podcast or if you have an RSS feed at all, pay attention to what he's saying here.

717
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And I'll interject here and there and I don't think I'll get to the whole thing.

718
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But listen to what he says about feed, hijacking.

719
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hi Adam.

720
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Thank you for having me on the show.

721
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I really appreciate getting the chance to talk to some of your listeners about what I regard as a tremendous threat to the whole podcasting infrastructure.

722
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
My name is Eric Marcus and for a bit more than a year now, I've been doing my podcast Eric Steiner.

723
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
At the time that I started, there were fewer than 50 podcasts available.

724
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And my show was not only the first one to tackle the subjects of veganism and animal rights.

725
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It was also the first podcast to talk about food, recipes and cooking.

726
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Now, over the past year, Eric Steiner has grown steadily more popular.

727
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
When I started out, each show drew only about 100 listeners.

728
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But by last month, my audience had grown to about 1,500 people per show.

729
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Now, this is not a Howard Stern sized audience clearly.

730
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's not even a dawn and drew type audience.

731
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But Eric Steiner does appeal to a niche audience.

732
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And I think that if I can do a show that reaches more than 1,000 people,

733
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
interested in vegan eating and farm animal protection, that's a fantastic use of my time.

734
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh, by the way, I just want to interject.

735
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I think if you have more than 1,000 that you can probably start to make money on that if you're interested.

736
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
People have emailed me to tell me they've become vegan as a direct result of listening to my show.

737
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I even had one guy right and tell me he bought an iPod specifically,

738
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
so he could listen to my show during his drive to work.

739
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
This past month with my audience creeping up toward 2,000 listeners per show,

740
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I thought I was ideally positioned for further growth.

741
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I figured that if I kept working hard to produce a quality show,

742
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
5,000 listeners was just around the corner.

743
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Instead, everything I spent this past year working on has suddenly collapsed.

744
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
My RSS feed has been hijacked by someone I've never met or even heard of,

745
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and every single one of my subscribers through iTunes has been cut off.

746
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
In consequence, my audience has dropped overnight by 75%.

747
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Now, a lot of people know what domain hijacking is,

748
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
but even as a podcaster, I'd never heard of RSS hijacking until it happened to me.

749
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
As I'm about to explain, RSS hijacking involves a different and much simpler technique than domain hijacking.

750
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
See, not only is RSS hijacking easy to do,

751
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,000
it also doesn't involve the overacts of law breaking that usually need to occur in order to hijack a domain.

752
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I personally regard RSS hijacking as the greatest threat that the podcaster community has encountered to date.

753
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So let me explain how I discovered that my podcast feed was hijacked,

754
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and why I think RSS hijacking is so insidious.

755
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:23,000
A couple of months ago, I read on slash dot that Yahoo had released a new podcast search engine at podcast.yahoo.com.

756
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I went to that site and was pleased to see that Eric Steiner already had a listing.

757
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But on this listing, I noticed that the RSS feed listed for my show was not hosted by my website vegan.com,

758
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,000
but instead was hosted by some website I'd never even heard of called podkeyword.com.

759
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Now, what happened was obvious.

760
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And random guy up there owning the podkeyword.com domain had created an RSS feed on his site

761
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and pointed it to my RSS feed.

762
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And somehow Yahoo had picked up his RSS feed instead of my own

763
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and inserted it into its directory listing for my show.

764
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Now, I'm not the most technically savvy person you'll ever meet,

765
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
but I could immediately recognize the danger here.

766
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Over time, more and more Yahoo users would subscribe to my show using an RSS feed that belonged not to me,

767
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but to a third party.

768
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Now, I'm from New York and perhaps overly suspicious about people's motives,

769
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
but I could see it at glance that this feed hijacking had extortion written all over it.

770
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
In getting his URL for my podcast, carried by Yahoo's directory,

771
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the owner of podkeyword.com was establishing himself as the gatekeeper who could control all traffic to my show

772
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
from listeners who were subscribed through Yahoo.

773
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Now, this is really interesting.

774
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
This is rampant.

775
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
This is happening all over the place.

776
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:06,000
If you register with audio, if you register with any multitude of directories,

777
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
perhaps it is even true with podcast, Ali.

778
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm not sure.

779
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
We'll have to look at that.

780
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You know, this claim your feed shit that I see everywhere, where you claim your feed,

781
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
so then you get a new feed, like an audio feed.

782
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
These are where this is where it goes wrong,

783
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
is that these things get exactly what happened to Eric here is that that feed got sucked in by Yahoo

784
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and Yahoo for all intents and purposes today.

785
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That's my feed.

786
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You know, that's the right feed, no problem.

787
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't think there's any malicious intent here, but it is a problem.

788
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This, by the way, is the same thing that feed burner does.

789
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You know, yes, feed burner is great.

790
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Feed burner has a lot of benefits.

791
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It's very easy to use, but if feed burner crops out, if feed burner decides whatever they decide,

792
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
they effectively, you know, have control over your RSS feed.

793
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
iTunes does the exact same thing.

794
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen, they also, in effect, hijack your feed and then they create their own special feed,

795
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
so you have to keep coming back to them and you don't get it directly from the source.

796
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And we all know what the issues are there.

797
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
If iTunes messes up, well, caching your RSS feed, then your podcast doesn't download for,

798
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
sometimes for four hours.

799
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So this is not the way to do it, and I think that we've known this,

800
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
the people in the RSS space have known this.

801
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's a bad way to do things.

802
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
The best way to do this is to register a domain name.

803
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
A domain name that you can then point anywhere you want.

804
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So you should be able to put in a redirect.

805
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So it would be atomspodcast.com slash RSS.xml,

806
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and you should be able to redirect that anywhere you want,

807
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
so that if you wake up one morning and decide that you're not happy with,

808
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
with your infrastructure, all you have to do is just change a couple of parameters,

809
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
and everyone will stay subscribed.

810
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You've really got to look into getting a domain name.

811
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You don't take that lightly.

812
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's very, very, very important.

813
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Erick's comment goes on for another four or five minutes,

814
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
but I think it's very clear what's happening here.

815
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And I suggest that you look at getting a domain name,

816
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and redirecting to the infrastructure that you're using.

817
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And of course, when the pod show podcast delivery network comes out,

818
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
we'll have those options built right in for.

819
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Hi Adam, this is James from JamesB.com.

820
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Here in Utah, in the US, we have a slightly different vernacular

821
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
to express ourselves when we're mad,

822
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
allowing me to demonstrate.

823
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm mad as heck, and I want to quit my fetching day job.

824
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm bored out of my freaking skull with it.

825
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Dang!

826
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
What the flip do I have to do, gosh darn it?

827
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Oh boy, if my mother could hear me now.

828
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
If you thought of Napoleon Dynamite when you heard that,

829
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
let me state for the record that my mother was from the west side of Prestonite home.

830
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So Adam, don't forget about us, poor Utah fellows,

831
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
that never learned how to properly work blue.

832
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
This is James from JamesB.com, Navalcast,

833
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and my new podcast, face the music, saying,

834
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
God, I can't wait to quit my day job.

835
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Hey there, my name's Krantz.

836
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You can find me at a couple of different places,

837
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
namely, frikogonvenus.com.

838
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The Sunday fun message that was downloaded

839
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
into my ears on Sunday,

840
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
had me rolling.

841
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But it is also very, very true.

842
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The reason I spend most of my time listening to podcasts

843
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and ignoring the radio,

844
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and even television really,

845
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
is because it's a bunch of shit.

846
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm tired of hearing the same song every two hours,

847
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm tired of, and I am mad.

848
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I am mad.

849
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm a human being Goddamn,

850
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and in my life has value,

851
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and I'm mad as hell!

852
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And I want to quit my day job!

853
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm mad as hell,

854
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and I want to quit my day job when I quit.

855
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous.

856
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Now, we must be ready for a new danger.

857
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Hey, I'm Jack Elias from the Get Jack podcast.

858
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Get Jack.Honomus.com,

859
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and I'll spell it out for medically in a minute.

860
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Um, God, you know, you're teasing us now.

861
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And we want to quit our jobs.

862
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Some of us actually,

863
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
my wife says that I need to keep working at my job

864
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
until such time that this pays more.

865
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Which is fine.

866
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I totally agree with that,

867
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
but hey, you know,

868
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I care it.

869
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
A tidbit, a taste.

870
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I hint.

871
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Something.

872
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Please?

873
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Get Jack.Honomus.com

874
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That's hotel alpha,

875
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
alpha,

876
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
alpha,

877
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Sierra,

878
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
dot com.

879
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Kind of like Christmas and on,

880
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I got all rolled into one.

881
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Konnichiwa, Adam Curryson.

882
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm Terrence Young from the Kobe beef show

883
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
at www.cobey-beef.blogspot.com.

884
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Since the music industry won't let us have

885
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
our hit test and backtracks podcasts,

886
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
how about a quiz using material

887
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
they can't control the Japanese language?

888
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I know you know you're Dutch,

889
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
but how's your Japanese, Adam?

890
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
A while back,

891
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I sent you a promo,

892
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
which featured the word Botakuni,

893
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
which means Ribbon.

894
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I hope you remember.

895
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Yeah.

896
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
They agree at least.

897
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Now it's time to learn some new words.

898
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The game is simple.

899
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
My trustee,

900
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
imaginary cow sidekick,

901
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Teibontaro,

902
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
will give you a practical Japanese word.

903
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Three answers to choose from,

904
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and you guess the answer.

905
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Take it away, Teibong.

906
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It's...

907
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Let's guess Japanese.

908
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Hi.

909
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Today word,

910
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Kurija.

911
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Kurija is...

912
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
A.

913
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Rare Japanese glam found in the Japan Sea.

914
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
B.

915
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
City on Southern Island of Kyushu.

916
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
C.

917
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Nickname for Love button.

918
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Found in another region of every woman.

919
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I'm going to go for sea.

920
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm not bad.

921
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I know that hard one.

922
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But I hope you guess right.

923
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I hope you guess sea.

924
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I'm going to go for love button.

925
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yes.

926
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Kurija is Japanese slang.

927
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Floor Clitoris.

928
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Kuriya is shockening of work.

929
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Kitoris.

930
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Browns.

931
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Kuri, Dori, Su.

932
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
In Japanese.

933
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And John is invomer ending.

934
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Usually added to people name.

935
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So next time,

936
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
you are love snorkeling with Patricia.

937
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You got affectionately caught her.

938
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Love button.

939
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Kurija.

940
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Kurija.

941
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You try now add-on.

942
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Kurija.

943
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Kurija.

944
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Kurija.

945
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah.

946
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Very good.

947
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Hope you enjoyed that add-on.

948
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I know it's nowhere near as polished as the hit test.

949
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But I hope at least you got a chuckle.

950
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And a new word to use with Patricia.

951
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Kurija.

952
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
A regular new hongo time lessons.

953
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And my rants about life in Japan.

954
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Please check out the Kobe beef show.

955
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000

Also, Dear Pod Showgun.

957
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Tibon and I are definitely excited about the audition

958
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and getting hooked up with the Pod Show.

959
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So we'll be back soon.

960
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
With another additional.

961
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000

962
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Nyongo quiz time.

That's right.

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
All right.

00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
See you again.

967
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Mata ne.

968
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
All right.

969
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Bye bye.

970
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
All right.

971
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
