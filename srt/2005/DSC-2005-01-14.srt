1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Transmidders, we don't need no stinking transmemines.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Fantastic with Adam Curry.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to the daily source code for Friday.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And it's Friday, so you know what that means, right?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now if you brought to yourself, yes, I know what that means.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's Patricia waving at me.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then, uh, just a full of shit because you don't have to do anything special on Friday.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today we're doing a sound scene tour.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's right.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Popular demand since we did that in Miami.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry, whoop.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Did I actually say Miami?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Of course meant to say Wolf and South Beach.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sorry about the crack and sound there.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, oh shit.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Getting on my wires out of the car into my bag.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
As we're going to take a little trip down to the town to the lovely town of a guilt-foot.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Which you already figured out, right?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hold on.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Just putting all my...

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Crap in.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Bye, love you.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She's laughing at me.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As usual.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Floughing and her silly ass husband doing silly ass shit.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh man, the plug are my...

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Shoot, they're really sucking now.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The plug on my...

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I River where I have the microphone plugged in is crackling.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Whoa, sorry about that.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Uh...

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's not good.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Because you whenever I just jostled a plug even a little bit,

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
it gives that crackling sound.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let me see, is this...

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's been two minutes already.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Does that make sense?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Uh...

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, I'm going to suppose everything's working, okay?

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And otherwise...

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well...

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You know the consequences.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Of experimental shit.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh man, you hear that?

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hate this sound.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is that coming from?

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe that's...

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ooh.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hold on.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's from the other side.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hold on.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay, hold on.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's see if I can fix this, okay?

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, so how crappy did that sound, eh?

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So, okay, it's the...

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It is the plug-except that's on the receiving side.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Could I have the...

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The wireless transmitter hooked up because of the great quality of the live microphone.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Everyone was real pleased about that when I used it for the south beach walk around.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Um, so we are now in Studio A8, which we were only using today as a vehicle,

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
not as a studio recording device.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In the driveway, at the...

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Cottage and we're back and up...

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Getting out on our way down to Starbucks.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, let's see.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Today is Friday.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's January 14th, 2005.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Um, and as you...

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you heard yesterday's Daily Source Code, then you know that...

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There was still no broadband here.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And it's not really easy-nets fault.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Uh...

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A little beep for Patricia.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's not really easy-nets fault.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's...

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's British Telecom.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's a surprise surprise.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's the government run out fit.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's fucked it up.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Um, and although they are really...

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I mean, you can see their system working because I am a business customer, not residential.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Of course, a business customer in a residential area.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
At the end of the road, as I was pointed out to me the this morning.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Um, they haven't really done a lot of these types of installations.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They've only been doing them for a year or less than a year.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The LLU, the local loop, unbumbled, which essentially means...

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They're selling me.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
They said, just selling wire, they're not selling an exchange or anything.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Because the other end of that wire is connected to easy-nets gear at the Gulford Exchange.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And so when something goes wrong in the installation process,

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
they don't really have all the...

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Excuse me, all the bugs worked out yet.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
As to where, you know, and how to resolve some of that.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So, as I said yesterday, the only missing piece now is the piece between the curb

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and the side of the house where the wire that goes into my office terminates.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Um, we're talking no more than 30 feet.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Probably even less, but, you know, it's like...

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Like, they keep talking about a surveyer that has to come out.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, there's the veggies out of me surveyer, of course, is it?

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sure an English phrase in this case that means a guy who does surveyor work or whatever.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So, I just got to throw some wire in the ground and connect with the two ends and we're done.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And I know that easy-nets is already looking at the end of that wire

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
because it's connected to their gear and the exchange.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, all they really need to do is, you know, just connect those two bits up

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and everything should work.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have half a mind of doing that myself.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Of course, that.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He's only going to confuse matters more, I'm sure.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So, today, at this morning, another guy showed up from British Telecom.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And he was there to install the line.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And he, basically, was the inside installing guy.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I said, well, you know, that part we got done.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now, we need the outside installing guy.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So, I said, why don't you pretend that you just did all this?

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Even though you didn't, it was already done.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then, just, you know, put the paperwork through as normal.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, of course, it didn't sound like he was going to do that

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
because he was an independent contractor to British Telecom

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and which means that he only gets paid if the work gets done and whatever.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, fuck it.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm on my way to Starbucks.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And we're doing two birds with one stone here,

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
because we're going to do the Friday podcast, the Daily Source Code.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And we just check and see how we're doing.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, everything seems to be recording perfectly.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now, if you were to look down at your iPod or MP3 player,

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you would see that we're now six minutes,

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
18 seconds into the show.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Approximately that is because, of course, before I put the show up,

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have to put my little opening and closer stuff on there.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Just to, you know, make it identifiable.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So, you recognize the power of pure intellect.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So, now I'm on, we're at the top of the hill,

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
as I'm driving towards the parking spot.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's actually, it's quite a production to get to Starbucks.

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not, you can't just drive in a town parking you there.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You have to park and walk and you can't park in the town.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, you can park in the town of Guilford,

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
except you can only park there for 30 minutes at a time.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So, you have to keep running back every 30 minutes,

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
or risk getting a 60 pound ticket, which is over 100 bucks.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Not worth any podcast, I'd say.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
At least not yet.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, we're turning into the, so on the side of the hill,

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
there's this car park.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's actually a number of car parks, which are quite good.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And they have signs on the outskirts of town,

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
telling you how many free spaces there are still left.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But usually when you pull up to the car park,

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you have to wait until someone leaves,

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and there's maybe a two or three car weight,

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
most of the time.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I see now that there's, let me see,

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
others plenty of spots up there.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It was really busy, busy Christmas season,

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but I tell you, because we have one of those,

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Guilford is one of those really idyllic kind of English towns

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
with a, with a Quaint High Street,

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
which, you're cutting that corner to close baby.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Careful, careful.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Ooh, man.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's lady backing up into a parking spot.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That was very close.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ooh, okay, you did it.

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So basically, everyone from out of town comes to Guilford,

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
because it's totally, you know,

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the Quaint Quality Street experience that you'd expect to see.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It didn't snow, unfortunately,

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
that would've made it so much better.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay, here we are.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You all have to watch out.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Here, I got to take it the other day,

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
for not being lined up precisely between the lines.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I got a 60 pound ticket,

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
because I was moved, let me see if I can make sure I'm inside the lines.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, no, no, no, no.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't want to fuck that up,

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
because they're serious about it.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You know what, though?

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It gave me a real attitude adjustment.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I certainly paid attention to where I park now

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and how I park.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You know, you know, basically,

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
oh, let me check.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, I'm in line now.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It worked.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
See, I don't believe in just little pansy-ass tickets.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you want to teach someone something like

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
don't park at the handicapped spot,

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
make their car fucking explode.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They won't ever do it again.

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know, if it's at $20 fine,

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
like, I'll risk it, right?

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It doesn't work that way.

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So now,

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
thank you.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We're going to go get a parking pass.

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Or pass, it's basically a ticket all by itself.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So, I am wired up in the same fashion.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I did in South Beach.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I've got the wireless transmitter receiver pair.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Transmitter in the back pocket.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Receiver in the front pocket.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hooked up to my eye-river recording.

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I could do about 17 hours.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Probably even on the one battery that I have.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's see.

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Two pounds in there.

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They'll take us to 14.

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay.

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Three-thirty is more than enough.

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Take it.

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I love the way this mic records everything.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can hear everything.

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So, perfectly well.

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's what a lot of people commented on.

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't think you just do this with any lovely or mic.

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not quite sure why this one works so well,

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
but I recall from when we did our reality TV show,

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Adam's family.

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How incredibly well it picked up conversations.

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Even if one person was wearing the mic,

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you could pretty much record an entire conversation with multiple people,

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
as long as they're more or less in the area.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So, what you do is you get this little sticker here,

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
or the ticket essentially is a sticker.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You put it on the window.

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So, you know what time you're coming back,

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
or what time you've paid till.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And they do check.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, yes, they do check.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay.

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay, we're locked.

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So, basically halfway down the hill,

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that's where the parking lot is,

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and I can see most of the town.

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And what we're going to do is we're going to walk down,

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
cut through a little back alley,

245
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and then we have to go through about half the high street.

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think it's just a great name.

247
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You know, I should be living on the high street.

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That would be perfect for me.

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then we turn left on the market street

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and go into the Starbucks.

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I guess what I'll do is I'll take it all the way in,

252
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
all the way through the ordering process.

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It shouldn't be too busy today.

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then maybe, I don't think that had a couple things

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
that I wrote down in my show notes.

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let me see what I'm going to say.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And we'll talk about those as we're on our way.

258
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, yes.

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you haven't heard the Canon Squip Show,

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
which is a dustingmybrain.com,

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ken Clark and Cindy Camelari,

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
who used to work with me.

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think new ideas in New York.

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
They're doing a podcast.

265
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I played bits of their show before.

266
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
To me, it's outrageously funny

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
because I know them so well.

268
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I know a lot of what they're talking about.

269
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think to, I think the last one they did

270
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
would work across the board for anybody.

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But they had a special guest on which blew me away.

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
They had Dave Kendall.

273
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I know if you remember Dave Kendall.

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He did 120 minutes on MTV.

275
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He was really the postmodern guy before,

276
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
along before Kennedy came in.

277
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And he was real.

278
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Kennedy was such a fucking poser.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not talking about John F.

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
by the way, but Kennedy the VJ Kennedy.

281
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know if she's not around anymore.

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
God knows what she's doing.

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I didn't like Kennedy.

284
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
She actually, she fucked me up one time.

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Really bad.

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We were doing an MTV Beach House the first year.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And she had just gotten there.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And we were doing segments on wave runners.

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And for some reason, she and I both got teamed up

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
to do a wave runner segment together.

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And she thought it would be really funny

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
to, while I was doing a segment,

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and thus completely unprepared for anything other than,

294
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
you know, the relationship to the camera that I was dealing with at the time.

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
She felt it would be really funny if she ran her wave runner into mine,

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
which she did, which is really dangerous.

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because, well, firstly, it threw me off the wave runner,

298
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
hitting the top of my thigh against the side.

299
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And that has always been a problem area on my body.

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's basically the muscle there got damaged.

301
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Not that it's something really horrible,

302
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
but you know, whenever I say,

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
whenever I, you know, that area is just sensitive still.

304
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And that was, you know, 10 years ago, whatever.

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I should have sued the fucking bitch.

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay, we're now walking past the truck here.

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We're on the high street, walking right into the high street, actually.

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
At the top of the high street is a statue.

309
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have to be honest, I've never actually read the inscription

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to see who it is.

311
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Of course, it's George Abbott, that makes sense.

312
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Archbishop of Canterbury.

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He lived from 1562 to 1633.

314
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He was a Gilfordian and the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbott, of course.

315
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Quite a scholar.

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There's also the George Abbott School,

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
which is, actually it's the first school we try to get

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Kristina into, but it was full.

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You believe that?

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So what I should do actually today is I should put the header graphic on

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Curry.com back up and you'll see the clock of the,

322
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
what I have the plane right now is doing all that traveling

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and the plane fly by header graphic on the web log.

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm going to put the Gilford clock back up.

325
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So you know exactly what I'm looking at at this very moment.

326
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's not too busy on the high street today.

327
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Anyway, let me get back to Dave Kendall for a second.

328
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So Dave, as it turns out, has been producing television shows.

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think it was, what do you say on the show was the fabulous vacation homes?

330
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And he is about to go off for two or three months to Thailand to work for

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
an NGO, non-governmental organization, helping out people.

332
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But not, not in the tsunami region in the north of Thailand,

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Shang Mai, which I've been to.

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I've actually been up a little further north Shangri,

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
which is, well, I sent it as the last town you hit before you go up

336
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
to the hill tribes.

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I did a documentary there once and visited them.

338
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But Shang Mai is a great town famous night time market in

339
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Shang Mai. You can buy anything you can imagine there.

340
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And it's the nighttime market, which makes it that much more kind of exciting.

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll tell you what, since we're only 15 minutes into the show.

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why don't I walk instead of going straight to a D-line to Starbucks?

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why don't I walk down a little bit more with you?

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So left and right, I'm walking on cobblestones.

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And left and right, we've got sidewalk.

346
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And I'll just see some of the shops here.

347
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Give you an idea.

348
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Jigsaw, Karen Millen, Ted Baker, Goldsmith,

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's a jeweler, River Island.

350
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
A T-buttoe, Clarks.

351
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What do we have here?

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Bennett T.

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Moda in Pele.

354
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Lush, fresh handmade cosmetics.

355
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The phones for you, a lot of phones stores, a lot of mobile phones stores.

356
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Mapping and web, another jeweler, DNA, Oasis, House of Fraser.

357
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's a big one.

358
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's a famous store.

359
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thorntons.

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We're just book shops.

361
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Sussex stationers, Russell Bromley.

362
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Then of course there's the mechs.

363
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And super drug.

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Obviously boots.

365
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The gap.

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Lakeland.

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Some of these you've got to recognize.

368
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There's the Vodafone Store.

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There's the Virgin Mobile Store.

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And they're right now at the Angel Posting House.

371
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Which is quite famous.

372
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's actually the place we stayed if you remember where I discovered that most of this

373
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
most of the town itself.

374
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now we live on Fort City.

375
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Most of the town itself has a Wi-Fi blanketing the area.

376
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And they actually have a Wi-Fi link in there as well.

377
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But the lounge has been closed for the past couple weeks.

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So I haven't been able to actually try that as a download and upload spot.

379
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So.

380
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What's that?

381
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What is this?

382
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What's in here?

383
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah.

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's the homeless magazine, right?

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There you go, buddy.

386
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's too.

387
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Thank you very much.

388
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay, the homeless magazine, which, say, working, not begging.

389
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There you go.

390
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I like that.

391
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So one pound forty, I gave him two pounds.

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And let's see what's in chemical brothers.

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
One car-wise in there.

394
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Business in Baghdad.

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I think I know it could be interesting.

396
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But chemical brothers on the cover of the big issue, which is the homeless magazine.

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Well, how many homeless there are in Gilford?

398
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I haven't seen any.

399
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't think.

400
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's the affluent Surrey neighborhood.

401
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We don't have homeless people here called Dennis.

402
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
All right.

403
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So anyway, that was a Dave Kendall.

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It was just fun to hear him again.

405
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He actually worked at my company for a year or so.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What did we have?

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That was before we actually had to go into the service business, which is, or we were still

408
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
doing stuff like the Grammy Awards.

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And we had a lot of cool cybercasts that we do that we were doing.

410
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's walk through them all here.

411
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There's the next upper gallery.

412
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's what it's called.

413
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So he did something called, what was it?

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Was it alternate?

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Alternate?

416
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Alternate?

417
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What was alternate is what we called it?

418
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And he was basically producing content.

419
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And it was really good at it.

420
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We just didn't have any real way to capitalize on it at the time, which was really

421
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
a shame.

422
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But he, of course, knows the UK.

423
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And so I was listening to this podcast in,

424
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and we were in South Beach.

425
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And then I heard him say,

426
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
what the fuck is that?

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm curry doing gilphid.

428
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's hard for people to figure out.

429
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's what I was telling the producer of the CBS Evening News.

430
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He said, what are you doing in gilphid?

431
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Because she'd actually been at the London Bureau for about eight years.

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Linda, whose last name I'm not mentioning.

433
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Even though she wants me to.

434
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I want to keep her on the same level with the Donna and share.

435
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So Linda said, what the fuck are you doing in gilphid?

436
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, excuse me, did I forget to say that I'm boring?

437
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And I like being anonymous.

438
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And I don't think she really understood.

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay, we've just successfully walked through the Galleria.

440
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And now we're going to walk back up the hill on the other side of the high street,

441
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
which is North Street.

442
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And this is actually where you can park for 30 minutes.

443
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So we'll do as we'll pick up market street here.

444
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
To get to Starbucks.

445
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh boy, it's great.

446
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Whether it's about three degrees.

447
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Sun is beautiful.

448
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's just shining.

449
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So the temperature's kind of the same as when I'm used to.

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We're Belgium and Antwerp and also in the Netherlands.

451
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But, uh,

452
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
simply because a lot more sunshine here.

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Of course, when the mist is in here,

454
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
it stays for a lot longer because of the way the countryside is laid out.

455
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Mist really has a chance to just sit there and not burn off and not go away,

456
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
which is a downer.

457
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
If you schedule the helicopter flight at least.

458
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Okay, the markets are actually open today.

459
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I've got about that.

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They put a market on the unknowns.

461
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You can have flowers, they have Dutch flowers.

462
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Dutch crescentalums.

463
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Wow, two pounds, 75 per bunch.

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You can buy that for a quarter of that in Holland.

465
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Of course, Dutch tulips.

466
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
320, three pounds, 20 per bunch.

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
For 10 stems, man.

468
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Expensive.

469
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Okay.

470
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This is, uh, I can't remember where market street is.

471
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay, here's the, I don't know,

472
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
at the backside of the house of Fraser, which means.

473
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The market street should be just around the corner.

474
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And this, of course, normally, this is where you can park for 30 minutes,

475
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
but forgot, as of Thursday, midnight,

476
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you can't parkly be towed because, well,

477
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
they build up the market on all those parking spots.

478
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And it's, it's quaint.

479
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, yeah, every night.

480
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, someone, I guess they're looking for shop lifters.

481
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That was cool.

482
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They got security guard talking.

483
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I was walking, talking, describing what some kids look like,

484
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
who apparently are walking up.

485
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's see.

486
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They will get some action.

487
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And again, maybe not.

488
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Here's that store, the fashion store,

489
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
FCUK, which, of course,

490
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
is one of the more brilliant marketing

491
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
moves of the decade.

492
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Because, of course, you just see the F and the K,

493
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and you think, uh, that brand is fuck,

494
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but it's not.

495
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But it works because it's highly recognizable.

496
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay, here we are in Market Street.

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And there's, no one's allowed to drive here

498
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
until, uh, after 6 p.m.

499
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and we're going to go into Starbucks.

500
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And I'm just going to let you,

501
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
listen along until I'm upstairs and settle,

502
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
then we'll continue talking because I don't want to get confused

503
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and think I'm a complete idiot,

504
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
which, of course, I am.

505
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Here we go. We're inside.

506
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Let's see.

507
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There's no line.

508
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay.

509
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Hold on.

510
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Hold on.

511
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He is really cool,

512
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
that doesn't embarrass us either.

513
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's great.

514
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Thanks for leaving me.

515
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Hello.

516
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Operational Grande for a here please.

517
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Sorry.

518
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,480
And the answer to that, sir?

519
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,280
No, let me see.

520
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,560
Now, you recommend the proper set of brownies.

521
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,600
You recommend the chocolate-fudge brownies?

522
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,560
I'd have one for that, I'd have one.

523
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,840
Oh, I'll have to have one, then.

524
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,040
If you recommend it, absolutely.

525
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,640
Good sales job.

526
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,640
Just smiled so sweetly.

527
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
How could I refuse?

528
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,800
And it's so hot in here coming from outside.

529
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Let's see.

530
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Oh, the CDs for sale here.

531
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Jazz impressions?

532
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
You guys like a record store now?

533
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Yes.

534
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
How to tell you?

535
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,800
A lot of people keep asking us about some music that we play.

536
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Yeah.

537
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
We play on a huge CD.

538
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
It's like about 200 songs on it.

539
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
They play random.

540
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Yeah.

541
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
So they take selections of them and they make CDs at them.

542
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Really?

543
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
You're like a big iPod.

544
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Yeah.

545
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
There you go.

546
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
That's cool.

547
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Great coffee.

548
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
And all that jazz.

549
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
A reether under her spell.

550
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Jazz impressionists.

551
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Cold train.

552
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Cool.

553
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
That's it.

554
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Thank you very much.

555
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I'm sorry.

556
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Yeah.

557
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Great.

558
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Oh, the chocolate brownie does look spacious.

559
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
I have to say.

560
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Okay.

561
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Over to the pickup area.

562
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I've got to take my coat off real quick.

563
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
It's getting hot here.

564
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Okay.

565
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Let's see what's in the big issue.

566
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Besides the chemical brothers.

567
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
tsunami.

568
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Soul searching.

569
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Sean Tillman.

570
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Harmar superstar.

571
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Of course.

572
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Oh, that's cool.

573
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
This isn't actually pretty good.

574
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
This magazine.

575
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Got lots of advertisements.

576
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
The condition is this.

577
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Set up as a business.

578
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
And I want to give homeless people the chance to make an income.

579
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Campaigns in behalf of homeless people.

580
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
It allows homeless people to voice their views and opinions.

581
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
To become a vendor.

582
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,800
You must be homeless or vulnerably housed.

583
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Considering my.

584
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Plumbing.

585
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
I may be vulnerable.

586
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
House.

587
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
That's from many people being houses.

588
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
One of the first days you're getting off the streets.

589
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Therefore, a vendor needs to continue to sign a big issue.

590
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
We may allow them to.

591
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Cool.

592
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
This is great.

593
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
What a great.

594
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Brigade.

595
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Great.

596
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Great.

597
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Great idea.

598
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Chipsy radio station aims to hit the airways.

599
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
First in radio station dedicated to gypsies and the travel lifestyle.

600
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Could be up and running by the end of this year.

601
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Great.

602
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Thank you very much.

603
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
That sounds like a podcast.

604
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
The gypsy and traveling podcast.

605
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Perfect.

606
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Don't see why that would be a radio station.

607
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense.

608
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Have a radio station for people to travel.

609
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Okay.

610
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Put some nutmeg on here.

611
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Yeah, what else do we cinnamon today?

612
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Yeah.

613
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Stick in one of those twigs.

614
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,800
And mush it all up.

615
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Get 8,000 napkins from the dispenser because you know you can't just take one.

616
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Right?

617
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
It's one of those metal dispensers that never worked right.

618
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Okay, here we go.

619
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Okay, we're now going up the stairs.

620
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Great.

621
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Lots of space.

622
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Okay, I've successfully scored a seat near the electrical outlet.

623
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Which is kind of like the big thing here.

624
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
That's what you got to grab a moment.

625
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
So, okay, we've made it up.

626
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,800
And there's a couple of things I wanted to talk to you about before we wind up today's show.

627
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,800
I'm going to get my laptop out.

628
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
And of course, my power plug.

629
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,800
So actually, a lot of people are here today.

630
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,800
It's really not busy at all for a typical day at Starbucks.

631
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Maybe only 10 people up here.

632
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,800
That's why 10 people me Bob Dylan on the Starbucks iPod.

633
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Did you hear that?

634
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,800
They're basically selling music because people hear the music they're playing.

635
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Check it out.

636
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Does that sound like podcasting or what?

637
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Switch on there.

638
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,800
So they, you know, whatever, I guess they, they must have some kind of structure to ask about that.

639
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
If they have some form of survey.

640
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Hey, I think we're not connecting here.

641
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
People.

642
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
There we go.

643
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Connected.

644
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Up.

645
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Don't call home on.

646
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
See you, this is.

647
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Lee Wilkins.

648
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
I'll leave them in the middle of my podcast.

649
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
You got to wait, buddy.

650
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
Yes, something to say.

651
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm sure he's been calling me off and on for the past couple of days.

652
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Okay, so I don't have my team mobile account set up.

653
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm not going to make you wait while I do all that.

654
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
I did want to.

655
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Whoops.

656
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
What happened there?

657
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Really?

658
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Yeah.

659
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Okay.

660
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Do my Mac just decide to close down or what the hell?

661
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Come on.

662
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Oh, there we go.

663
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Oh, there we go.

664
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Let's see what I wanted to mention.

665
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Oh, I've got a lot of comments about Andy Hertzfeld.

666
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,800
I've talked about yesterday and maybe I came on a bit too strong.

667
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Lots of people said, well, you know, you're probably right because Andy just told

668
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
didn't get it.

669
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,800
But also, they were saying, well, Andy's not like supposed to be completely with it anymore.

670
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
He's no longer an engineer inside of Apple.

671
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,800
I didn't want to come across as, you know, he's certainly no idiot.

672
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
He's a really smart guy.

673
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:04,800
And if I apologize if I went a little bit overboard on Andy, you know, on Andy.

674
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Excuse me.

675
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,800
That wasn't nasty.

676
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Another email I got, which was great.

677
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
This is from Nightwise.

678
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,800
He's leaving comments on each source code.

679
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,800
I, of course, he says, I hope you get your broadband fixed.

680
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,800
He says, you know, sitting outside in the car by yourself might make your neighbors think the following.

681
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
And I just want to share this one with you.

682
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
And of course, I'll put it in the show notes.

683
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
So, A, I made creepy stalker.

684
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
B, I had a fallout with Patricia and I've been kicked out of the house.

685
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,800
C, I am sucking the man that would be breaking my non-smoking pact.

686
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,800
D, a freaking geek that is not allowed to use his laptop in the house.

687
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,800
E, you're watching your region free porn collection.

688
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
F, you're on the phone with Madge.

689
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Or E, all of the above and different combinations.

690
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Well, you know what?

691
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Except for the sucking the man, the non-smoking pact.

692
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,800
And the creepy stalker bit, I guess you're right on.

693
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Although I haven't gone the phone with Madge yet.

694
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Oh, fabulous.

695
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,800
And one other thing that I wanted to mention, which is his whoops,

696
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,800
and those that I river, which is a huge deal in the media here right now,

697
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,800
is the Kabbala exposé.

698
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Basically, some undercover documentary teams have been, you know,

699
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
exposing this whole Kabbala movement.

700
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,800
This is the religion or the like faith or believing stuff,

701
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,800
spiritual stuff that Madhana has been such a part of,

702
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
particularly promoting it.

703
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,800
And you know, they're exposing, you know, all this fiction about it,

704
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,800
you know, this supposed in special water, you know,

705
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
comes from, you know, almost literally from the tap.

706
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,800
You know, all the things you would expect from expose,

707
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,800
and it's just like it's making Madhana look really stupid right now.

708
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
And I don't know if that's gotten to the stage yet,

709
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
but you can certainly expect that.

710
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
That's just something I caught last night.

711
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,800
And otherwise shoot, now we're looking forward to the weekend.

712
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Princess is coming sometime this afternoon.

713
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
It's Christina's pony or horse.

714
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Luke called me around the around 10 30 this morning.

715
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,800
He was just about to get on the ferry at Cala,

716
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
which will take him to Dover and then from Dover.

717
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
He drives to Gilford.

718
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
He's never driven in the UK.

719
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Certainly not with a trailer with a horse behind it.

720
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
And he'll be driving left-hand side.

721
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,800
So we hope that God is with him and he drives safely.

722
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
And he'll be with us for the weekend.

723
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
And of course, that means we're taking the horse to the stables.

724
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
And he and Christina will be training all weekend.

725
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,800
And on Sunday, my sister-in-law and her daughter Ivana Roxy show up.

726
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
And they're going to be with us for a week.

727
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,800
So I'm probably going to take the opportunity as we have four chicks in the house.

728
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,800
I will probably sneak off to Amsterdam for a day and back.

729
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Sometime next week, which I'm obviously going to coordinate with any other broad bend.

730
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Work that is being done at the house.

731
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
I'm really hoping this works out.

732
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,800
And maybe I have to coordinate it expressly for that.

733
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
So I can go get some broad bend, you know.

734
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Book another easy jet trip.

735
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
So I can go sit on the big pipe in the bunker.

736
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Which by the way, it looks like we might have some potential buyers for it.

737
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
So fingers crossed everybody.

738
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
All right, that's about it for me for today.

739
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,800
I hope you enjoyed this little trip down from the cottage to Gilford.

740
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,800
You know, one of these days we'll do it in their first order.

741
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,800
And we'll go from Starbucks back up to the cottage.

742
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Have yourself a great weekend.

743
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Be healthy, be happy.

744
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,800
And I will talk to you on Monday with another daily source code.

745
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Bye-bye.

746
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Let's do the Incernet song because I love ending up with that.

747
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Goodnight Incernet.

748
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Goodnight Incernet.

749
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Goodnight.
