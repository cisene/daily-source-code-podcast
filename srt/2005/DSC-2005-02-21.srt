1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Daly source code for February 21st 2005 transmitters, we don't need no stinkin' transmitters!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The podcast is a generation of rockers!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Autistic, it's Adam Curry!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Alright, that kind of sucked, doesn't matter.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey everybody!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Alright, I admit it.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm someone who needed it.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's all on the fingers.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I just got back from the Dawn and Drew Shindig.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Everybody get your daily source code.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It is technically Monday.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's February 21st 2005.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Work with a daily source code coming to you from San Francisco.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Actually it's Sunday night, so technically we'd have to say it.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It would have to say it's 20th, but when I get this up on line, it'll be the 21st in certainly in East Coast and all of Europe.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, only us here on the West Coast are lagging a little bit behind.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey everybody, it's good to talk to you.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's been a couple days and left in New York, obviously, and have located to San Francisco.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We're kind of downtown, and it's beautiful here.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Except for the weather, but it's nice and yellow, you know.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, this evening, at 7 o'clock, when it started, was the Dawn and Drew extravaganza, the Shindig, the Hoda.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh my god, I'm trying to...

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let me just make sure I've got my wires all crackling and messing it all up there.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wow, I mean, what a great fan base, what a community Dawn and Drew man, this was awesome.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's see, PsychoFam Jeff was there, PsychoFam number two.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh man, parts of the Pod Squad, Steve Bielmore, Michael Butler, Michael Gohagan.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We see Dawn and Drew obviously.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh man, the folks from young who were on the cover of the New York Times with their cooking podcast.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Our friend from Apple, who has been...

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not going to mention his name, because, you know, I don't want to jinx it.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's been so good helping us with the recent dot Mac problems.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh man, some people who were interested in doing a podcast about...

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's an introduced foreign film to US audiences.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It was just, you know, wow, a lot of really interesting people all in one spot.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It was without a doubt, invigorating.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So I'm back at the hotel now.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
In my hotel room, and we haven't spoken to each other for a couple of days,

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
didn't really get a Friday source code in there, because let me think,

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I mean, geez, we have so much to talk about.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's see, the Bitties.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let me see, go back that far.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hooked up with the Bitties on Saturday.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And they came over to the hotel in New York.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Had a great time. Oh, took a great picture, which Lian sent to me.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I'll get that up online as soon as I can.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And we hung out, we talked about the Bittie cast,

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and they told me all about their plans.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And, you know, these girls, they've got it together.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So cool. I'm so happy for the success of getting the show at Joe's Pub.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And just, you know, having a final day in New York with them was really nice to kind of wrap things up.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Particularly since I had a, it was like the end of the day, right?

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Or the afternoon.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And so I had one, and I'm not really a drink at all.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
As you know, I mean to other things.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And what I have, I had a, a vodka martini, pop my goodness.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Whew. Also on Saturday, I hooked up with Cindy,

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
squipper from the Ken and Squip show.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of course, I used to work together at my company in New York.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And it was great to see her and, you know, reminisce about some, some good times.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes, some good times.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And talk a little bit about her, a podcast that she's doing with Ken.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And it's, it's really, it's been, often on.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We just been talking to people, of course, the New York Times article.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You probably heard about this on the front page of New York Times,

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
a big podcast story.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My phone started ringing at like quarter seven in the morning.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Because we've been talking to all these people in New York about podcasting.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And there it was, you know, boom, front page of the Times.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wide magazine came out with their special about the future of radio.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Really nice.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I guess there's three avenues that, that they're looking at, which is a satellite radio.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then there's some digital audio broadcasts to a terrestrial, digital broadcasting.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And podcasting.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And it was just like, wow, you know, they're totally predicting this as,

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's going to ruin radio?

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Or perhaps I would, you know, say, what's going to reinvent it and reinvigorate it.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because boy, there's still a lot of creative people in radio.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Maybe just we've kind of, kind of lost track of how many cool things you can really do with it.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And most of that is purely because of, you know, commercialism.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's when you're dealing with a finite resource at just time.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's when you got to cut stuff down.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I've been talking a couple of people who were talking about Howard Stern.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And, you know, I read about, oh, and now once he's on serious,

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you know, then he can say anything he wants.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But, you know, that's not what it's about.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Howard Stern has never been about, you know, how wrong she can get.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But about honesty.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And it's a fact.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Most guys, you know, if they're straight, they get off on,

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Lipstick lesbians.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And if you're honest, then you'll say, yeah, that's true.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And all guys will.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And that's all Howard Stern has done.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He's always, he's just been honest.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I think he's been honest most of the time.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And that's what podcasting is about.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's the honesty and there's no fake voices.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And, you know, as we know, that life is just indecent.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's why life never gets into the mainstream media.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because it's fucking indecent.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We talk indecent.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We act indecent.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
At least according to the broadcast standards,

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
none of its decent.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's why it's fake.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's why they have to, you know, be so careful and it's just boring.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's, you know, and life is also funny.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Life is just funny.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Like tonight.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Great.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Great time with everybody at the Don Andrew Shindig.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's people, I think I'm really bad at names.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He came in from Tampa, Florida.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I was flying back at 7 o'clock this morning.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, well, it was there.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It was, I know him for getting all kinds of people who,

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Sam Levin run around like a maniac as usual.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's just great.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Great community.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Great to everyone come out.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A lot of fun.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
All right.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's get some cranking here in the podcast.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I've told you about Sid, my Pimp Daddy,

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
who has been known to send me a pretty cool mashup.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He sent me this one a couple of days ago.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't kind of like it for a month.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I get in the mood.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Apple Levin versus McSleazy.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Come on, baby.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah.

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Buddy, come out.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000

Do you know?

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Do you know?

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you know?

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000

Do you know?

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,320
use the set since I last refreshed the batteries. I really pissed of myself because I thought

234
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,040
I'd bought my eye a river because I was totally planning on doing some sound seeing here

235
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
there and you know, I thought maybe San Francisco would be nice and costed so many different

236
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,560
opportunities I've had but I can't find it either. Either I've lost it or I just didn't

237
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,280
bring it with me. I want to go on with the window now. There's no much going on here. Earlier

238
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,000
there were some sirens and stuff going off could have been a little bit of some street noise.

239
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Hotel room was really nice. Psycho fan Jeff hooked us up with hotel rooms that friends and

240
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,960
family price and he had a you know like a little welcoming envelope for everyone who's come out to

241
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,760
see Don Drew. It's just has been it's like we've come to Mecca baby. It's beautiful. I'm sorry.

242
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,680
Let me just get it. Water here. Did they uh I thought they had brought new coffee pods. What does

243
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,000
you know they have coffee stuff in your room but they give me like two regular, where's my

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,760
fucking sense? Two regular fresh brew coffee and then one decaffeinated so I had run up and

245
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,800
so we drank that while we drank the regular. There's still tea. I could have that. I've got a water now

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:38,160
so I'll be good. So um flight this morning. I want to talk about that for a second man. It's

247
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,520
you know I haven't been in New York since before 9-11. Been in the States obviously but not in New York

248
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,640
and so this morning Sunday flight granted it's you know a very busy day considering you know it's

249
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,600
Sunday and it's the holiday weekend and then everything. But I hadn't flown from JFK or any

250
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,320
really New York airport in a long time and let me just talk about this Homeland Security business.

251
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:08,240
Now I know a lot about aviation. I'm a pilot so I'm going to have to say that um you know

252
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,360
I know what's going on in the air and I know what's safe and not safe and you know what you can protect

253
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,960
from what you can't protect but I was really just blown away by the amount of bullshit the

254
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,760
citizens of the United States of America are putting up with to fly. You know it's a fucking show.

255
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,800
I mean you kind of carry your bags to the scanner and then the scanner to the bomb detector

256
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,600
and then you go through one checkpoint and another checkpoint and then you take off all your fucking

257
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,800
clothes and you know and and I know as Americans we're like yeah but you know we got to do this

258
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,000
for safety and against terrorism but if it were really helping any in protecting us I'd be all

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,040
for it but it's crap it's you know this is the people I see running the scans and you know

260
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,600
now they're government officials right they're Homeland Security and you know that's great

261
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
and I'll do in their job and it's all patriotic and all that shit but come on it's not it's not

262
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,680
protecting us it's really not it's not making your flight any safer just you know think about it

263
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,280
logically okay so maybe you can't have the exploding shoes you know she's it's not hard to get on

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,200
to a tarmac anywhere any airport and do whatever you want to do you know the whole point

265
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,200
about the the the the nine eleven terrorist attacks is that no one expected them to do it this way

266
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,920
so you know you can go on protecting this crazy it's crazy it's really slowing everybody down

267
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,240
the economy would grow and speed up if we got rid of some of that shit or why don't we just

268
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,000
make a big red gate at the at the the door of every single airport and you walk through it

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,640
and you hear all these lasers and scans and retinal things going and lights flashing and

270
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,440
robotic voices talking will all be really fucking convinced that we're safe and you've been sniffed

271
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,920
and did nothing can explode or dangerous or pointy or whatever and we look inside your DNA and

272
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,840
your brain and just tell people that they're safe but hurry the process up okay gosh and in

273
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,040
New York itself I mean I hadn't been in New York so I used to go to all these buildings and you know

274
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,520
meetings and I've been to these places before and now in New York you have to go through

275
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,600
it's like the terrorism is broad and a tremendous industry there must be hundreds of millions

276
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,760
of dollars worth of scanning equipment and wet logic tech Jesus Christ everywhere I see these

277
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,880
fucking logic tech webcams there and you know when you come into the country at customs you

278
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
have to look into the webcam and it's all logic tech which is kind of interesting and it's

279
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,000
tremendous money was made on this terrorism business let me tell you any same thing at the

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,600
buildings you're not secure this can you're bag but you know you can you can always

281
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,520
go detonate yourself it's just well anyway end of rant Jesus Christ I can't believe it and

282
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,000
apparently it's not that bad at every airport in the States but I could believe it and it was

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,880
a flight from New York to San Francisco just it's crazy crazy I tell you magic has been traveling

284
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,440
Madge Weinstein have been following everyone's favorite lesbian on a trip down to to Gussies Place

285
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:31,680
in Miami and by the way also I'll be sure to check out Feast of Fools which is Madge's friend

286
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,200
Faustos podcast very interesting very funny very very funny Patricia's gonna love it

287
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,720
when I get back home I'm gonna totally turn around to all these pie now she's she's

288
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,840
listening to Madge before but I think she'll like Feast of Fools as well but you know Madge was

289
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,400
basically reading all these big billboards and these big signs driving down I guess it's

290
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,560
not A1A is it maybe it is A1A or the Ronald Reagan highway I think is what it was

291
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:10,080
and she ran across a sign which well it was a clear channel sign and let's listen together

292
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,520
to what Madge said because I heard this I think late Friday night or Saturday night maybe

293
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,400
yes on the Friday night in my hotel room and I was just laughing out loud when I heard this

294
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:28,640
and on this has to be the post disgusting thing I've seen even in Florida a billboard that says

295
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:37,280
God give me a sign and it has the clear channel of icon right below it or the clear channel logo

296
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,520
on the clear channel name on the sign not just the advertiser of the sign it's also the advertiser

297
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:51,120
on the bottom of the sign is the sign owner but it specifically says God give me a sign clear channel

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,600
so that is the most fucked up thing I've ever seen what the fuck does that supposed to mean

299
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,520
that up God is what's making a clear channel on half the planet as far as radio is concerned

300
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,720
well listen to this fucking sign this is Madge Weinstein on the god damn podcast

301
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,360
okay I'm your fucking sign you in his holes I'm your sign take this

302
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:26,080
lovely Madge Weinstein use radio on useradio.com totally trippy love that very much

303
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,160
got an email from a blast from the past was in New York you know again I'm looking at my

304
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,560
my Gmail on red count 500 exactly on red so it's hard I'm trying to pick stuff out and

305
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,400
archive stuff that I want to get back to later and you know this what happens when you're on the road

306
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:53,760
email from David Weiss a blast from the past you may know him better as David was of was not

307
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,480
was and he said that he was reading about podcasts and he was thinking of getting into it and doing

308
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,160
something so we'll be talking to him in the next couple of days so that was not thought that was pretty cool

309
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,080
moved servers just in time for the big the big onslaught from the New York times

310
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,480
learn some really interesting stuff though you know this is all paid is hosted on frontier with Manila

311
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,680
and it was hosted on the on a windows machine and I moved it over to an excerve which is

312
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,840
Macintosh OS X put their server version and you'd expect there wouldn't be any difference and that is

313
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
normally that would be correct but have discovered something very interesting in frontier

314
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
although it's a great you know cross platform

315
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:49,600
well it's more than just an application right it's an outliner it's a it's a web server it has a built in

316
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:57,920
scripting language it's an object database I mean I love this I love frontier there's a San Francisco

317
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:07,360
Siren's for in the background anyway it doesn't do very well with different character encoding sets

318
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:16,320
I don't know a lot about this other than that there are different character sets for different

319
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:24,080
countries and keyboards and you know basically if it's not unicode then what the fuck I don't

320
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,720
understand but I know that it's incompatible and the opml directory which has all these different

321
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,920
nodes linked from you know well at least 40 well more than 40% of the directory is now maintained by

322
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,120
other people totally decentralized which I love a lot of those opml feeds were made with

323
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,680
you know notepad or you know other other programs and so there's all kinds of weird characters

324
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:00,240
and some of the nodes which unwindos wasn't a problem apparently but on OS X is a problem so

325
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,680
Marcus Muller who's been working with me for a long time was trying to figure out how he

326
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,120
can sanitize some of the problems we're seeing now isn't as an intermediate fix and then I guess maybe

327
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,480
we're all going to have to you know use radio user land or something like that or you know

328
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,160
at least something standardized so that we all can kind of get the same opml

329
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,240
at least habit compatible and actually then I was you know talking to Marcus and thinking about it we

330
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:37,920
should really work on expanding the directory work on let me see you know making it this people

331
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,960
who own the nodes in the directory there's so much more we can do with that and so I really had some

332
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,440
thoughts about that anyway so know that if if it's see you know if you're using it in perhaps

333
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,320
in the iPodder or if you're using it in Doppler radio or if you're using it in an

334
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:03,200
in a pandemic by the way I wanted to say that I had checked that out and I talked about the opml browser

335
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,720
and immediately Ed got all over some of the some of the things with the links it turns out I didn't

336
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,520
see the the links in the opml directory they were down below in the browser and so he's he's

337
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,480
also took that a little bit to make it a little bit more obvious and it is a great iPodder client I

338
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,920
got to say it's sweet it's short it's you know it's minimal but it has all the bits in there and all the

339
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:32,080
advantages of you know some some smart management of your files it's definitely check that out

340
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:41,360
and I am I Q so anyway working on it working on making that better so bear with me there is

341
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,920
also there's a if you want a static version of the file semi email if you're using it in

342
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,920
an application or if you're using it in a directory or if you're having some troubles with the

343
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,600
feed as it is now just shoot me an email and put it in the subject opml directory and then I'll

344
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,480
send you a link where you can get a fresh static copy of that file so we can keep everything rolling

345
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,320
all I do a little bit of experimentation okay so that's the iPodder directory what else oh yeah

346
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:17,440
I have to talk about dot Mac so I got a beautiful long email from from a friend who works at

347
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,280
at Apple this is a friend now I didn't know him previously and he had been following along the

348
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,800
rants of you know all of a sudden these problems that we were seeing with dot Mac I disk hosting

349
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,840
people like me putting their podcasts on the other I disk because for some reason the way their

350
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:43,200
web servers are set up they weren't returning the size of the file which is something that most

351
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,200
of the iPodder software is looking for because if the download breaks you have a reasonable download

352
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,680
and you can only know what to resume if you know what the total file length is so that wasn't

353
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,160
showing up anymore on not for any podcast any MP3 file that was hosted on a dot Mac server on

354
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,880
I disk and it does turn out that there was some you know some code that you know that they had

355
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,080
running some legacy stuff that kind of broke when there was an upgrade of something else and they're

356
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,600
aware of it and they're working really hard on it and they're actually they're quite proud of all the

357
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
all the podcasts that are being hosted on their infrastructure and they really came to at least these

358
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,760
guys you know in the in the dot Mac server center I guess sort of network operations center they

359
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,440
really want to help us podcasters so the word is probably another seven to 10 days for it to be

360
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,400
completely fixed and then we can go back to using our dot Mac for hosting which is good news

361
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:51,120
let me see we have here man it's so much to catch up on oh got a plug Clark's podcast

382
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,680
you've been talking about Vegas a little bit on your show and so i decided to take up the

383
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,480
challenge of going out and creating a sound scene tour the neon museum in Las Vegas we have a lot

384
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,400
of neon in the city obviously and neon signs are one of those few things that are saved around

385
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,640
here before we upload something i just walked around and talked about the signs they described the

386
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,800
signs and so it was fairly easy although i did have some wind noise and forgot to take some photos

387
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,520
the night i went out oh i got all the neon signs those are lit up i just forgot to capture a few

388
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,680
storefronts i posted the mp3 and the photos at audio dot visit my lasvegas dot com you can

389
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,040
listen to the mp3 and your laptop and then follow through the photos and when Elvis says thank you

390
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,240
thank you very much you flip over to the next photo yeah i know it's cheesy but we are in Las Vegas

391
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,240
so really i made you a sound scene of the banana gift snacks this this huge super biggest

392
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,520
glit store it might be fun to walk through and talk about dice clocks and all the statues and fuzzy

393
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,160
dice anyway have a listen to the uh sound scene tour and let me know what you think thanks

396
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,000
little bit before uh i started podcasting i was actually already learning apple script at the time

397
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,600
i think that i'd written one or two uh XML like parsing things at a part of it uh and i did a

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,840
yonpo let's dot'sblockspot dot com okay see you next time for another edition of the hit test

459
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,240
by Adam thanks yon appreciate love the changes much more challenging totally cool they're going

460
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,440
it and you can even uh try some uh sixties and fifty shit i mean i'll be fun too because

461
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,760
although just what everybody likes listening to the hit test uh too much 80s uh makes it a little

462
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,040
narrow because uh i do get a lot of people saying hey you know i've uh 50 no let's say not a lot

463
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,440
people Steve Gilmore says you could do 56 these maybe even some 70s so uh you can you know

464
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,320
shaken up a bit but i really do like the shorter bits that's uh maybe you do the you know do the

465
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,040
bit and then do a two to two play each clip two times after each other with a little bit of

466
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,760
breaking between maybe that's even better so that i don't have to stop and yeah and i'll just let

467
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,800
it run through um and then either i guess it or i don't right so i get two chances to guess it

468
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,720
with the audience that's probably the best way to do it thanks again yonpo let and it's in the show

469
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:20,960
notes yonpo let dot blogspot dot com oh dot the present hey Adam this is Neville Hubson and Amsterdam
