00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Daily Source Code for May 26, 2005, episode number 185.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's the Daily Source Code coming you from LA.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right, Los Angeles.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How you doing?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It is, well I'm just, just my volume here.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It is relatively late, 130 as AM been here since around 8 o'clock and got some stuff to talk about.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So I figured trying to blow out a full source code.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm still trying to get my levels all set here, hold on a second bear with me while I just set this like that.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oops.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm, uh, there we go, that's better.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm on the, uh, under G4 Powerboard.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My, uh, my tablet is with Brian, who stayed in San Francisco.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Brian is also, uh, he does operations for Pod Show.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He's, uh, got some work out there and doing some meetings.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So I don't have cast plaster in my disposal.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Um, but I do have some cool stuff to play for, and some stories to share.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So first of all, I got to let you know that, um, after, you know, the week that we had in San Francisco,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Apollo Alto, um, in the Bay Area essentially, uh, staying in, uh, you know, kind of, more, uh,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
mid to low scale hotels.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We splurge and where the Beverly Hills hotel and lovely Beverly Hills, I've never actually, uh,

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
stayed here ever, ever been here myself.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know if Ron has or not, but, you know, we're treating ourselves, but we think we've deserved it.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We've worked hard.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So it's, uh, so it's really nice.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Had some room service stayed in, um, oh, man.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I've, I've got to do my laundry.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Um, so I have to send stuff to be pressed and some stuff has to be, uh, has to be clean,

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
because of course I really only packed enough stuff until Wednesday night.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But Patricia even said to me, she said, um, you know, I should probably pack more,

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
because I know I have a feeling you're going to be staying longer.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You watch, you'll be staying longer.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And, uh, she was right.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Of course, because the wife is always right.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We've discussed that before, haven't we?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We've established that.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Um, anyway, they're doing fine.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I miss them terribly, both Patricia and Christina.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And, uh, yeah, man, we've, uh, I should tell you this, uh,

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
it's such a long story.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's so late, but reminding to tell you about a Christina getting hit at school,

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
uh, on the nose, actually, well, it's such a great story.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Anyway, the Patricia wound up, uh, you know, basically kick in some ass at the school,

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and she's, she's like, uh, reminds me of that, uh, of the movie,

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
of course, of the real-life story of, uh, was it, uh, Joe Brown,

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
the principal who had the bullhorn and, uh, and the baseball bat, you know,

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
it's like Patricia all of a sudden did that to the, to the school,

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and have fun on the right over now, and she's really, I don't know.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's just, uh, something beautiful happened there.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And I'm, I'm really, I'm pissed off.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I wasn't there, man, because, you know, together,

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we're really good at stuff when we're, we're, we're,

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it should happen. So, anyway, parenting stuff will, uh,

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
uh, Patricia and I should probably do a podcast pretty soon.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We can catch up, uh, and while we're catching up,

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which is kind of stuff that, I think is nice and works well.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, anyway, um, staying out here,

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
going to stay for a couple of days longer,

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
through the Memorial Day weekend,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and then going to do one more meeting on Tuesday,

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and then I'm going to go fly back, because then it will be,

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
uh, shoot almost, uh,

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
or is it 10 days or something like that?

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So it's pretty long, but it has been so worth it,

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
so much cool stuff has happened yet again today.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Um, and we're going to talk about some of that.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Uh, I'm going to try and keep it within, you know,

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
30, 40 minutes, but I also wanted to play some excellent music.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I saw that, um, I've been following the Michael Jackson trial now.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There's, uh, it just looks like, um,

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
he was completely being railroaded, and as I predicted,

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and I don't think it'll be convicted of anything.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think that, you know, this is very clear what's going on.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm telling you, I have some experience in this.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This should happen,

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and spiraled out of control in his case.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It really did.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And the media mainstream media has, you know,

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
basically even when you say, you know,

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
wacko jacko, you're editorializing a report,

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you know, your news, right?

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And it's, uh, we know that's happening,

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
but that stuff is fucked up, you know,

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
his name is Michael Jackson.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Anyway, um, so a mashup came across my desk.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
P. Doug, PW Fenton has been, uh,

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
producing the pod show over serious,

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and he's just been lining up some fucking awesome shows.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Uh, really, really good stuff.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We've got some great submissions.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Uh, let me just, uh, I have his show notes,

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
which, of course, show up as my show notes.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And then I pretend like I did all that laborious work on them.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Uh, this is, uh, home on a second.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Uh, you're gonna love this.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's something, uh, it's a little different.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not in my, my normal studio now, of course,

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and I don't have my mixer and my external processing,

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and, and I've kind of forgotten how to do it,

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
but it does, it does still work pretty well.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Um, this is, uh, sent in by DJ May Lune.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think it is.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's Eminem versus Michael Jackson,

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
versus Justin, and it's extremely timely.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's timely for, uh, what's been going on.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Listen to it.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is my best.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's so beautiful tonight.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Your eyes are so lovely.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're not this sweet.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Never thought I would end up this way.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A lot of people misunderstand me,

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but it's because they don't know me at all.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I just want to touch you.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know you.

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know you.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't know you.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I think everybody's all gelatin-ship,

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
because I'm like the lead singer of the band.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Me, did.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And they need to take it up with me after the show.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Go to the free.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Go to the free.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Go to the free.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Just you, you're free.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Just you, you're free.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Just you, you're free.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go to the free.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now I'm here, then be, now.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Or I'll be, now.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Go to get your mind.

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't you like that.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Use your own.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Do that, Do that.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Going to fight.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm giving you.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Only now free.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I just wanna swear.

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You're my, now I'm giving you.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You're the watch, you're my old man.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm who you can keep.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What is your about?

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm a friend, you have seen nothing, there's a way to bite it, do a big fun, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better,

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, it's better, I'm better, I'm more, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm first, Ior, I'm more, I'm better, I'm younger, I'm more, I'm better, I'm older, I'm a better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, myself,

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:12,880
I think everybody's all yellowish and shit

149
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,380
Because I'm like the lead singer of the band

150
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me

151
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,380
And they need to take it up with me after the show

152
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

154
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

155
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

156
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

157
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

158
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

159
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,880

160
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

161
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me after the show

162
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,880
And I think everybody's got a fucking problems with me after the show

163
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Yeah.

164
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
I don't know. It sounds a bit of the first time

165
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Oh no

166
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,680
No, no, but it's a timely mashup, you know, so that's kind of cool.

167
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,280
Daily source code, you know, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, this is a really famous place.

168
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,280
This is where a lot of leading ladies have been discovered.

169
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,680
There's all kinds of Hollywood history that comes from this place.

170
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,280
They've got the bungalows here and yeah, all that Hollywood magic.

171
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
All right here.

172
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,080
They actually make a custom hot dog.

173
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
16 dollar hot dog.

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Okay.

175
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:20,080
So I had reconnected recently with a good friend Julia Goldberg, who used to run all technology for us at

176
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Think New Ideas, like 600 people in the company.

177
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:31,080
It was a lot of laptops of crap and if you think, you know, if you think XP is difficult now, you know, think back, you know, like

178
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
7, 8, 9, 10 years.

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
You know, that was sucked, man.

180
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
It was Windows.

181
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
It was at Windows 98.

182
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Yeah.

183
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Windows 98, I guess.

184
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,080
And T, maybe 3.5 or something like that.

185
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
And so she lives in Los Angeles.

186
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,080
And, you know, we had reconnected recently through Steve Leads once again, kind of.

187
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
But that's a whole nother story.

188
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,080
And so I said, now I might be coming to LA, so she lives nearby turns out.

189
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
So she came over.

190
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
And of course, Julia understands me.

191
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,080
She's, you know, we've worked together for a long time.

192
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Exactly.

193
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Julia knows what the hard work and boy needs.

194
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
So she's a buddy.

195
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,080
She came over and we just caught up, man, we talked for a long time, actually.

196
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,080
And I had the custom made hot dog and the shrimp cocktail.

197
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,080
And she had tuna salad sandwich.

198
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,080
And it was actually, it was really good.

199
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
And then all of a sudden, she kind of comes clean.

200
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,080
And she says, you know, she's been listening to the daily source code for eight months.

201
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,080
And she, I mean, but like every single day, every single day.

202
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
She knew every single episode.

203
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,080
And man, she's had a lot of time to think about this stuff.

204
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
And she had some really good ideas.

205
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
And of course, I immediately told her she had to start a podcast.

206
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
So I'm sure she will.

207
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
And I'm really looking forward to that.

208
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
But it was, it was great to see her.

209
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,080
And even cooler that she brought along nice little gifts for your podcaster here.

210
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,080
And the Beverly Hills hotel feeling so lonely.

211
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
By the way, I haven't checked yet.

212
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
But I bet you they have porn here.

213
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Hold on a second.

214
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Where's the shoot?

215
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I got it.

216
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
And this is old school, man.

217
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Did this use the plug?

218
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Oops.

219
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
I hope.

220
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Yeah, there we go.

221
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,080
When I was in the castle.

222
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Okay.

223
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
I have a love mic on.

224
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Obviously, let's see.

225
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Many accessing interactive services.

226
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Large net movies.

227
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Select one for movies.

228
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Still in theaters.

229
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Hollywood hits.

230
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Yeah.

231
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Adult desires.

232
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
Okay.

233
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Adult's only.

234
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Not for minors who are offended by sexually explicit content.

235
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Extra large.

236
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Cool.

237
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Hmm.

238
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Okay.

239
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Anyway.

240
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
I have some other exciting stuff to talk about.

241
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
So we can.

242
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Shit.

243
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Sorry.

244
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Okay.

245
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Apple today.

246
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Yeah.

247
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Went to Cupertino.

248
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Oops.

249
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Sorry.

250
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
I'm over modulating a little bit.

251
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Went to Cupertino.

252
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,080
And met with the team that, well, I guess actually this is the iTunes team.

253
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
And iTunes music store team.

254
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,080
And there was an one developer there.

255
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
All really nice people.

256
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,080
And I think Amazon's actually done all of the podcasting coding.

257
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
And it was amazing.

258
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Now obviously we made an agreement that I just wouldn't talk about, you know, what's in there.

259
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
I certainly could tell you about how the meeting went.

260
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
But.

261
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
And we're working.

262
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Apple is not a company as you know that releases information early.

263
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
And they didn't make me sign anything.

264
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
No NDA.

265
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,080
You know, it's just a gentleman's agreement.

266
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
And I'm honoring that.

267
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,080
But we are talking about, you know, when we can release this news.

268
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
And they're admitting this is new for them.

269
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
You know, they never release it.

270
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,080
You know, any kind of news before the big unveiling of the product.

271
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
But this, this.

272
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Um, community is new to them.

273
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,080
This, this type of content is new to them.

274
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,080
And they really want to step in in the right way.

275
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
And they really want to help.

276
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,080
But I know it sounds unbelievable, right?

277
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:20,080
But, um, not all big companies, you know, do things for the reasons you think they do them.

278
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Um, and I can certainly tell you why Apple is so incredibly interested in podcasts.

279
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,080
And that's because, well, for one, they sell iPods.

280
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
And that's great.

281
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,080
And so they want to facilitate that and do that as an open, as open fashion as possible.

282
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,080
So, um, and we really had no agenda for this meeting.

283
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
But at least we didn't agree on one.

284
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Just, hey, let's continue our conversation.

285
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,080
So we went back and we sat down with this, you know, like five people.

286
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,080
And, um, it turns out that they, uh, wanted to show me all the features, all the functionality.

287
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Uh, all the ideas, you know, what, what's going to happen where, what you're going to see.

288
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,080
And if, uh, if I agreed with what they were doing, if, uh, if they thought if I thought it was a good idea,

289
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,080
what was there anything missing, um, uh, I think was unbelievable.

290
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,080
It was, this was, uh, it's going to sound crazy.

291
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
But this was users and developers partying together.

292
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,080
And I realized that this meeting, that that doesn't just mean that it has to be, you know,

293
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,080
independent users, uh, with independent developers independent of the platform vendor, I guess.

294
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,080
So we're trying to say that, uh, a good platform vendor, of course, will party with their users.

295
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,080
And here it was, it was actually happening, um, with this whole iPodter, I,

296
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,080
iPodter started out of frustration that this wasn't possible with iTunes.

297
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,080
And it was basically a way to make iTunes perform an action, which carried through to the iPod.

298
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,080
And of course, that branched out with, with, you know, with incredible work from so many cool developers, um,

299
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
which kind of developed version one.

300
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,080
And, um, what, what Apple has been doing has been, they've been listening, they've been watching,

301
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,080
they've been observing, they've been paying close attention.

302
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Um, this, of course, they've been doing, I guess, relatively silently.

303
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,080
I had no one to say, hey, I'm, I'm from Apple, and I'm doing this.

304
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Well, actually, that's not true.

305
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:22,080
The dot Mac people have certainly, um, you know, been working with us and working through their own issues,

306
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,080
uh, and, and helping out, you know, they've been providing bandwidth and not shutting people off who've had high flow,

307
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,080
and they've been doing that purposely, um, because they just wanted it to, to go, you know,

308
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,080
of course, we're going to have to all figure some stuff out.

309
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:45,080
And, uh, you know, there's lots of, lots of stuff to be looked at, but as it comes to, um,

310
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,080
iTunes as a, uh, a pod catcher, an iPodter?

311
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Yeah, they got it fucking right, totally.

312
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Um, and then doing some, some other stuff that, um, it's just going to be great.

313
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,080
So, uh, it was fantastic, you know, to have this thought and, and there it was,

314
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,080
a company and actually listened and created it and, and just done just an amazing job.

315
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,080
And I know it's, this, of course, sounds like I've been either hypnotized or, uh,

316
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,080
assimilated by the board, but, uh, what if it actually was true?

317
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,080
What if it really is all the things that we've been talking about?

318
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Um, and, but, but still in the, um, you know, as open as we, as all of our tools are,

319
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
what if it was really true?

320
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Um, I can't, you know, and I'm, I'm always looking for the bullshit.

321
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,080
The bullshit detectors on, on high alert, um, I can't see it.

322
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,080
So anyway, um, I've, as you know, I've requested, you know,

323
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,080
when I'd like to start talking about this, um, and I think that's a good thing.

324
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,080
And, uh, wouldn't it be interesting if, uh, if Apple, you know,

325
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,080
let us open up that dialogue and started, uh, getting some word out.

326
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
So anyway, so that was just fantastic.

327
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
It just blew my mind.

328
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
It really blew my mind, uh, to be there.

329
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Very interesting people, um, and I see nothing but benefit all around totally.

330
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Uh, okay, uh, but we'll, uh, back to some tunes.

331
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
What are we at now?

332
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
18 minutes. Oh, cool. That's not it. That's not that bad.

333
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,080
I thought it was going to take longer to get through all that.

334
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Um, what should I do? I've got, oh, um, Mad Weinstein was, uh,

335
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080
was going to Manhattan this week.

336
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,080
And, uh, she'd emailed me about that and I said, well, would you like to go and

337
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,080
check out the serious satellite radio studios where podshow, uh,

338
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,080
broadcasts on and go see for yourself.

339
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
This is amazing. What's going on over there.

340
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,080
And, and there are actually some people who are doing some really creative stuff.

341
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,080
And, you know, yeah, their infrastructure is different, uh, way different from ours.

342
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Uh, but, uh, you know, people who are doing, uh, exciting new stuff and people

343
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,080
who are doing more traditional stuff. You know, it's all there.

344
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Uh, and there's some really wacked out people. That's interesting.

345
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Um, and what's cool is Steve Leads, who has been on this show, uh,

346
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,080
and been mentioned on this show, uh, he, uh, he does a lot of stuff over there at, uh,

347
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,080
it's serious satellite. Um, and he kind of did a sound seeing

348
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,080
tour together with Madge. And I just want to give you, I mean,

349
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,080
it's what it's like 35 minutes. This is part one.

350
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,080
And it's, it's interesting to listen to, but there's also some, you know,

351
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,080
some typical Madge bands. And here's a Madge is being introduced to someone.

352
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,080
And she's going from studio to studio meeting of these different people

353
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,080
making different shows in different formats and different ways of, of creating them.

354
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Um, and here's an example of what that sounded like.

355
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,080
I think it'll come in here for a few hours and then that's it.

356
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
I mean, I imagine they can't spend a whole day like that.

357
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
So, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

358
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,080
If you had to four hour shift and theory, you should be able to do it in about 45 minutes.

359
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Nice. This is Rich and that's Jose.

360
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
This is, this is Madge.

361
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Alright, one's team. Madge is going to have fun.

362
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Oh, cool.

363
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,080
We're on the, hey, Jose program is the hard rock style.

364
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Oh, cool.

365
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,080
To represent Madge and rock and the, I'm going to set out which is sort of a college piece.

366
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Okay.

367
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Yeah, welcome.

368
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Thank you.

369
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
But you play on your, what are you going to be for?

370
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Well, I mostly, um, I do, uh, talk and we do a left wing sort of, um, I call,

371
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
people like, uh, amculture accounts.

372
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Oh, they're nice.

373
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,080
I say really nasty sounds about assholes.

374
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Yeah, I'm with, um, Adam Curry's channel.

375
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
I love to be helping him out.

376
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Excellent.

377
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Programming that.

378
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
So it's a podcast.

379
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
We're on a podcast.

380
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Oh, right on.

381
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Yeah.

382
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Right down.

383
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
So we're going to take you to the recording right now.

384
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Yeah.

385
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah.

386
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
It's like done the radio for the first time.

387
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Yeah.

388
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
So I'm on the radio.

389
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I'm on the podcast.

390
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
But your name.

391
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
No, that's great.

392
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
No, man.

393
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Who?

394
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
She's.

395
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
She's got this tool, her son.

396
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Oh.

397
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Did it be cut in by her?

398
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Yeah, this is a great story.

399
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
You got to listen to this guy.

400
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
You get the music.

401
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Like this is a neat invest of.

402
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Like a satinist.

403
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Ah, uh, wow.

404
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
It was pretty fucked up.

405
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
What is cool.

406
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Yeah, I don't know if this is to do it with your students.

407
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,080
And then you've confirmed the program.

408
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,080
I kind of knew Satan would be so high in the sky like this.

409
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
But I try to keep it even now.

410
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
I mean, it's true.

411
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
But we've got it.

412
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
It's Satan.

413
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I try to keep it.

414
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
If that player sits down and he's back,

415
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
I got to take her shit back.

416
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Right next to her.

417
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
No kidding.

418
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
So it's like a meal.

419
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
It's pretty cool.

420
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
That way I keep balance.

421
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
And the guy laid his things.

422
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
That's interesting.

423
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
But you get the devil's promises.

424
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

425
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
But I definitely appreciate what he's got.

426
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
So you've done a lot of drugs.

427
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Yeah, too.

428
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
I don't know.

429
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Oh, man.

430
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
That kind of works as serious.

431
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
He should be working with us.

432
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
He should be doing a podcast.

433
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
That's very interesting.

434
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Okay.

435
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Podsafe Music.

436
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,080
This one is a good friend of PW Fenton.

437
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Oh, fuck.

438
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Excuse me.

439
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
I'm uploading some tracks to his server.

440
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
And it's like crapping out.

441
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
I hate that.

442
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
Hold on.

443
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Shoot.

444
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Oh, man.

445
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
See, it's great.

446
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
You can do everything from the road.

447
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
But the internet connection.

448
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Sometimes are just not really that good.

449
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Okay.

450
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Fenton PWbs.

451
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
This is the New York Blues Queen.

452
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
This is Podsafe Music from Roxie Perry.

453
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,080
It's from a new CD.

454
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Back in Losville.

455
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:41,080
And of course, I'll put links to Roxie Perry and the show notes on today's source code.

456
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:59,080
I've been down this road.

457
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,080
Many times in the past.

458
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,080
This time the trip is going by so fast.

459
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Every stop, light, every street.

460
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,080
It's pouring me one way.

461
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,080
And the lead is in me.

462
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
Yeah, the lead is in me.

463
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Right back to shoot.

464
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:34,080
My back in blue is there.

465
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
And she'll love Paul's heart.

466
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,080
When you have a hug behind me.

467
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Love for me is due from the start.

468
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,080
I fall so fast.

469
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,080
I'm the fat of you.

470
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
That it all goes down.

471
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:06,080
And that pretty suit.

472
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,080
On back in blue is there.

473
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Back in blue is there.

474
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:51,080
You know the hotel there.

475
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Just keeps my room on home.

476
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,080
And in the register book.

477
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,080
You know they're all my lemon gold.

478
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,080
They'll have blessings.

479
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
I told you that.

480
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,080
You got more values this time.

481
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Then I'll feel it all my red.

482
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:25,080
All the best.

483
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:33,080
All the back to blue is there.

484
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,080
All the best.

485
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Yeah.

486
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Roxie Perry.

487
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Back in blue is there.

488
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:52,080
There was actually this song that motivated me to do a source code at this kind of day.

489
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Did I just say night of day?

490
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
That was stupid.

491
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
Time of day.

492
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Oh man, that sounds great.

493
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
And hopefully we'll speak again on Friday.

494
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
We don't have a great Memorial Day weekend.

495
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Somewhere I'll put something out there.

496
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,080
So good things happen in my friends.

497
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
Really positive.

498
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Like it.

499
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,080
And we flew first class in American Airlines.

500
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Just a spite America rest.

501
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:37,080
You're not everybody take care.

502
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:15,080
To twor all the door in hot hours.

503
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Thank you for watching.
