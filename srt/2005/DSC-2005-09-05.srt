1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'll just share it Charlie two, three, five, and good morning everybody.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,640
If you're in the United States, hope you're enjoying your extended holiday weekend.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
It is Monday.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:20,880
Today is the fifth of September, 2005, and I am going to be leaving the cottage in just

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,240
about an hour and a half on my way to New York for a couple of days.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm taking the portable workstation with me, so I'll be able to bring you hopefully a

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,320
full-blown daily source code every single day, except for today, and today being

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,240
a holiday, I figured I'd do something a little bit different.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,680
I am going to relinquish my feed and my time to something that is going to come to us

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,120
from the pod show headquarters in San Francisco, California.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,120
We now switch over to Michael Butler.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm here with Ron Bloom, and what's the other person's name?

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
Brian Longus.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
Brian Longus.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
My name is Michael Butler.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Hey, Michael.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
So what are we doing here right now?

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Well, we're here at the offices, the entry offices of podshow.com, and when it started

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,560
a couple of weeks ago, it was an empty space, it's now full of very talented people.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,600
And as we grow our company, we realize that podshow has some more needs and a couple

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,400
of areas, and we want to talk about it, so we're creating our first job cast.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Now, what's a job cast anyway?

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,560
So job cast is when Brian Longus, who's ahead of operations, starts to pull together,

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,920
a list of the kind of talent we're looking for over here, and we sort of support the links

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,000
that you would normally see on a website, on a website, you would see a typical company,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,600
you would see something like job inquiries or employment opportunities, and we think that's

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,720
a little boring, actually we kind of think it sucks, and we're appealing to a different

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
type of person.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,960
We want innovators, hustler, starters, dreamers, entrepreneurs, really motivated people,

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,080
and we're starting with some opportunities to round out our engineering side, and there,

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,600
we wanted to make sure we let these engineers know that over here, we think that they're

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,000
sort of the undredties and the superstars and the heroes of the whole podshow organization

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,840
along with those podcasters, and we want to make sure that the quality of engineering management

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,320
that we get are sort of driven and dedicated people.

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,040
That's number one.

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,320
Number two, if we were to go any farther, we wanted to talk about something because this

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,440
first job cast is coming out at a time of deep concern for a good part of the United

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,040
States as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and I know you're a Florida fella.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
Yeah, you're from Florida, but we had hurricanes all the time.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Yeah, hurricane suck, and this one's such a really bad, and for for anyone who thinks that I

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,640
read something that people, a lot of people are not familiar with that coastline down there,

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,200
it's it's it's beautiful, incredible place full of warmhearted people, it's the birth

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,640
of music as we know at the United States and then fluency entire world, so we're supporting

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,520
giving of yourself and giving of your time, but also giving of your money, we thought

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,040
about putting up our own fund, but it's just too complicated.

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,520
So we're driving people to just go right to the redcross at redcross.org, we're going

47
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,840
to make a contribution as a company and individuals.

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,800
We have links on the websites, podcasts, there's a put you made a promo, didn't you?

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,280
Yeah, I made one last night, I knew a lot of people have, and just about why not

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,600
everyone, but a lot of podcasts are not putting banners on their site, and you can actually

51
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,040
make a donation through PayPal, I believe.

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
They probably great.

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,800
Anyway, you can do it, please do it.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,040
If we can help you let us know if you're a podcaster, and you want to run somebody else's

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,200
promo send us an email, and maybe we can mix them and people can have a little more

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,480
excitement about it, but we sure support it, and please do a good deed and find your

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,040
way to the redcross.org or anyone else you think that you would rather support.

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,440
That city is like one of the greatest cities in the country too, and it's like pretty much

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,680
destroyed under water.

60
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,040
And from those of you who have lived through that in the economic times when you were economically

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,280
underwater, imagine your whole life just basically being flooded, and that's what's

62
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
happened to those people.

63
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,800
And there's every single one of them down there are brave, and they're going to require

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,480
all the help we can give them, so please reach down deep and help them.

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,960
All right, so that brought the job cast to a kind of a bummer section, but let's pick

66
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
it back up.

67
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Okay, if you're an engineer, and if you're the engineer, and if you know how to create

68
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,520
the best programming, the best, you know, with the best and fun people in the world.

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
What kind of engineer are you talking about?

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Audio engineer.

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,600
Right now we're focusing, I want to actually introduce you to Brian Logas, our director

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,320
of operations, Brian, how's your podcast coming, Brian?

73
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,720
I think pretty well.

74
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,840
What's the name of it?

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
We're working on it.

76
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
I'm thinking about it.

77
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
So you're a behind-the-scenes guy here at Podge.

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,480
Yeah, behind-the-scenes, engineering, operations, everything, and you are a CEO of your own

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,840
company prior to this, right?

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,720
Yep, not too long ago, about four years ago.

81
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,480
And as I recall, because I was down there, you had a big old offices in Washington, you

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,080
were having, you had all kinds of SQL servers, serving up all kinds of stuff, a couple

83
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,240
of million registered users, I think you had a couple million registered users.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,720
Actually, we were number 157 on the web in terms of tracking.

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,360
That was with PC data online.

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,640
So you were, we had an incredible site when it came to traffic.

87
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,600
I mean, that was these cuffs, and now we're building it on the west coast.

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,360
So Brian's out here looking, he's really running the show of helping us find this great

89
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
talent.

90
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,520
What kind of people we're looking for?

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,800
Well, we've got our A team and we're looking to grow it.

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,440
So we're looking for software engineers and database engineers or all-com designers.

93
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,920
So let's say we had this A team, we're putting the band together.

94
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,640
Do we need, second stringers, do we need, like, lead guitar players, lead vocals?

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Do we need front men?

96
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Yeah, we need front men.

97
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
We need the rock stars.

98
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,840
We need rock stars.

99
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Absolutely.

100
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,840
So what's a rock star in database programming to you?

101
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
What are those qualifications?

102
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,600
Someone that's worked in extremely high transactional volume.

103
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,480
We're talking about, you know, when it comes down to per second or per minute, the amount

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,040
of transactions is phenomenal.

105
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,480
Because this site, in what we do, we've got registrations, people who come, people who

106
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,960
register, and the hits to the database from one person every time they come could be phenomenal,

107
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,320
just on a per page basis.

108
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,040
And as we're ramping up, and we bring in millions of millions of people, it's going

109
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,600
to come down to optimization and being able to structure and design something now, so

110
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,920
it's ready for tomorrow.

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,920
So you want to guy, a little gal, guy for us is gender neutral.

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,680
You want a person who has built out a larger infrastructure, who understands, it'd be

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,160
a great, like what Michael said, who understands what an audio file is, you know, can

114
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
make a deal with audio.

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,640
It understands how important that is, and who can sort of make that connection of bits

116
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,280
and bytes and sort of get an understanding of it from the user perspective.

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Absolutely.

118
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,360
So you need super senior and middle-level people, the UDS person who's run a team before

119
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,360
or a data person who develop inside with their own team and also knows how to work outside

120
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,200
the company and bring in health from outside.

121
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,760
Yeah, we're looking for a little bit of both.

122
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,760
So when we're looking for a senior engineer, senior architect, that's someone who's worked

123
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,360
with, for instance, any modeling language, like a UML, not only can they design it in architect,

124
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,600
but they can also assist with actually writing the code and doing some of the work, we expect

125
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,280
everyone to wear many hats, many hats.

126
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,800
Not just sitting a corner, they're involved in everything, and our staff here now, you

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
think it's a room for that kind of, you know, someone who really is a type A to come in

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
and make their mark on the company, absolutely, and it is a type A, it's really, this

129
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
is something that's going to grow with them and grow with us.

130
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,480
So it's positioned in an ability for someone to come in now, really make a difference.

131
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,680
And I would like to apply, except for, I don't really have any skill in that category

132
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,800
but the job sounds, maybe.

133
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
So how many people you're looking for anyway?

134
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,520
We're looking for definitely two, a senior system architect, designer, and someone that,

135
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,120
as Ron pointed out, some of them can also bring it outside talent if we need to.

136
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
It's a media company, not a technology company.

137
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,040
So we need core people that are going to be here and help build an architect for tomorrow.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,320
And where is here?

139
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,920
I know where, but tell the audience to go.

140
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,680
So we just go and south of market, actually one hour temp offices now, and we're moving

141
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,800
within three, four or five weeks, I believe.

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,600
We got our space, we got our new space, we just got to fix it up, and we're

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,160
waiting, there's a, I don't know, what is it, a gazillion square foot office, we have

144
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
in mind for this person.

145
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,120
It's a gazillion close to a gazillion because they're big delivering multiple

146
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
big abides of information, as I understood it.

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,320
Yeah, big abides is what we're designing for.

148
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,720
Okay, so we got a gazillion, a gazillion square foot campus.

149
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,200
Nice, there are big screen televisions with videos playing all the time.

150
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Wet bar.

151
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Wet bar definitely a wet bar.

152
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Very much.

153
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
So next, over there, you can see it to the left, next to the jacuzzi, sometimes

154
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,560
you miss it because they're lap pool, they'll chase lounge by the lap pool.

155
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,200
We have a skate park in the back there, if you bring your skateboards, bring your skateboard

156
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,680
to skate, sometimes there's some traffic, we lend it to the city of San Francisco.

157
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,560
So there probably are some programmers who are skaters, so maybe if they're, if they're

158
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,160
into skating, so if they live in New York, they'd have to relocate in San Francisco, obviously,

159
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
you guys.

160
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
We'd help them out.

161
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,400
If they're the right people, you know, here's what we discovered.

162
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,360
Also if you're really talented and you want to work with us outside of the city, that's

163
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,560
a different kind of job we'd love to hear from you.

164
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,600
But we found out that if you're in the same office, the same physical space, that's where

165
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,800
the green glow comes from, that's where you walk down the hall or in this case, you

166
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,000
just shout down the hall and you say, I've got an idea and someone else goes, I've got

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,800
an answer for that and the next thing you know, you've got a little groove thing going and

168
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
you're building stuff.

169
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,680
And we, in just six weeks, I mean, we've done some monumental accomplishments in technology,

170
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,120
we haven't even been able to release him yet.

171
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,880
And it's all coming from the synergy of people being in the same space.

172
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,000
So we're really focused on people who might want to be out here with us.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,080
It's also really high energy and actually, to your point about relocating, we've got a

174
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,240
software engineer driving up here this weekend, packing up his youth home, he'll be here

175
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Monday evening.

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,080
And not to mention, San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, besides

177
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,040
New Orleans, San Francisco is probably in the top three tourists destination.

178
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
This is Kevin.

179
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Probably, yeah.

180
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,000
And a fact that I can point my microphone, I think you can see it over, oh, yeah.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Nevermind.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,200
It's a comedian, not only is he owned the company, it's a comedian as well.

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
All right.

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,200
No, it is an, and I relocated here just to just help it out, I'm curious, relocating here

185
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Brian.

186
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
I relocated here from the youth.

187
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,920
And you brought with you a pretty large family, right?

188
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,600
I've got a big family, twin boys and a new one two months old.

189
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,400
So we're in Michael Butler, you haven't relocated to San Francisco, but you're going to be

190
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,600
relocating into our office, right, helping us build Pod Show.

191
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, let's hope so.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That happens.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You get permission from the CEO of your organization.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why?

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, the wife has to give me permission.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,600
And my CEO approved the move, so I understand how that works.

197
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,680
So we, and we've probably got five or six more people relocated, and we have a couple

198
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
of guys.

199
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Like you said, one guy with the youth, I'll come and end them in the engineering side, we've

200
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,240
got another guy relocating from Virginia, and you San Francisco, I'd be heard.

201
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,240
You people down there and Silicon Valley come on up here and work for us because the

202
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,720
community is easy to sit back on the train and listen to your iPod and the next thing

203
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
you know, you're in the office.

204
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,720
And there's, as you can, as you know, by me, I have super long hairs.

205
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,720
If you, if you have feel like a long hair, a grateful dad or a rock and roll looking guy,

206
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,120
you're welcome to come in and have a job as well as long as you know how to program.

207
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,720
Man, would you just be good people?

208
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
That's right.

209
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Hair and no hair.

210
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Yeah.

211
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Okay.

212
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Right.

213
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
But it's a bit, no, be good people.

214
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
And we want to work as part of the team.

215
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
We have a lot of fun here.

216
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
We work.

217
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
I'd say we work really hard, but we have a lot of fun.

218
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,720
And we, we, the core people that help build the business.

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
They're the rock stars of our business.

220
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,720
And in engineering and programming, it's just as much reason to, to be respected for your contribution

221
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
as a, as a number one podcaster would be.

222
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
So there are all part of the family.

223
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Everybody's voice counseling.

224
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
We're looking forward to finding some great folks.

225
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
So if you're interested, what do you do, Brian?

226
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
What do they do if they're interested?

227
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,720
We've got email address and send along the resume jobs at podshow.com.

228
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
That's not going to Steve Jobs though.

229
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
It's going directly to us.

230
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
It's going directly to us.

231
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
So I should point out our environment.

232
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
We're a lamp environment.

233
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Linux Apache MySQL PHP.

234
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
People with CC++ background.

235
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
That sort of thing.

236
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Anyone who, not only has that skill set or can learn that skill set.

237
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,720
So, so I'd bet right now that someone will listen to this.

238
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,720
That is sitting somewhere that says, you know, I've been contributing where I am.

239
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
But there's people above me.

240
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
There's people beside me.

241
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
They, they have a destiny in this company.

242
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Maybe my destiny someplace else.

243
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
I wanted someone who's done enough for the place where they're out and wants to move along.

244
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,720
And, uh, I hope they find the right person to find their way here.

245
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
And there's a lot of tech podcasters out there.

246
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,720
And I would say probably maybe half of them at least are probably programs, right?

247
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Yeah.

248
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Absolutely.

249
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Or no somebody.

250
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
And no somebody who fits this description.

251
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
And that will be ideal guy because he knows what podcasters is about.

252
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
And he's into podcasters.

253
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
And, yeah.

254
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Which is why we have one of the famous podcasters and most famous ones in the whole

255
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Dang business.

256
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Michael Butler.

257
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
You know, you know.

258
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Well, that's part of the fun of the environment.

259
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
You know, last week, C.C. Chapman was here.

260
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,720
C.C. Chapman took a break during the day and did his podcast.

261
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Chris Rockwell took a break and used our sound studio.

262
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
The toilet.

263
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Did his podcast.

264
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
So you've got people coming in and out Michael Butler's here today.

265
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
It's an interesting environment.

266
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
It's fun.

267
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
And that's what we're going to be doing.

268
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
We're going to be launching a, an online.

269
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
And we're going to be launching a,

270
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
an online.

271
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Jobhunt advertising campaign created by some very strange people inside our own organization

272
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,720
and featuring a person from our engineering department,

273
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
whose name we will not reveal.

274
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
So you may be on the lookout for that.

275
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
And I think it's pretty dang interesting.

276
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,720
And it shows that we're, we're just not your ordinary cubicle.

277
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Not at all.

278
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Okay.

279
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
I think we wrap it up.

280
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
That's the end of job cast number one.

281
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Do we have a theme song?

282
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I'll find something off the page.

283
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
You did a job.

284
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
What does that mean?

285
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
I'll find something off the page safe music network and music.pidesure.com.

286
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Plug, plug, plug, plug.

287
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Thanks for a Michael.

288
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Thanks so much for coming over and producing this for us.

289
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
And we hope we didn't worry about you too much.

290
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
No.

291
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Thank you.

292
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
No.

293
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Thank you.

294
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Okay.

295
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Now, all right.

296
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,720
So, I hope that was,

297
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
even if you're not looking for a job in San Francisco,

298
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,720
that was interesting enough to listen to.

299
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,720
And another note, you can also go to podshow.com.

300
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Obviously for, for the job openings,

301
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,720
but also you'll see that podshow.com slash relief has a page up

302
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
with public service announcements cut by podcasters,

303
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
by pod squad members.

304
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
You could upload your own.

305
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
And of course plenty of links to the red cross

306
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,720
to donate to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

307
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
All right.

308
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Now to hear, I'm stepping on my favorite virgin upper class

309
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
to Newyville, York.

310
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
I'll be there this afternoon,

311
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
so I'll be sure to have a podcast up for Tuesday morning

312
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
as I said, I'm taking the full gear,

313
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
still to be the first trial by fire of the digital audio

314
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
workstation and the new setup and taking everything on the road.

315
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
So, I'll see tomorrow.

316
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Enjoy the rest of your holiday weekend, everybody.

317
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Those of you that can, and we pray for the rest who can't.

318
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Bye-bye.
