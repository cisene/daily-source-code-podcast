00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Delta CR at Charlie 218. Good afternoon everybody from Curry Cottage. Today is a Monday,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,080
no promo, no pod save music, no mashup podcast. Just a quick little update about some stuff

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
and some thoughts over the weekend and I just let you know what's going on because it is now

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,560
335 and I have to hurry up because it's 5 o'clock Patricia and I are leaving for London.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,880
Tonight is by the way it's such a hardship. Tonight is the Playboy UK launch party.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,280
I believe actually that Playboy UK launched once previously but I think this is a relaunch of

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,440
of the magazine probably on the heels of the success of their television channels. I'm kind of

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,960
doing stuff here at the same time and that will be a sound scene tour which of course I hope to

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,640
deliver to you tomorrow for tomorrow's daily source code. Patricia and I are staying overnight

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,360
in a lovely hotel overlooking the park not far from where the party is which is at a secret

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,280
undisclosed location. So needless to say I don't think there will be a lot of editing going on the

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:22,320
evening since yay we're alone. And yeah it's just been crazy busy today I just had a visit from

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,080
a producer from BBC Radio 1 hadn't been interviewed by Radio 1 yet so I was keen to do that

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,800
and because Radio 1 is kind of like the top 40 pop station really the popular radio station here

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,920
that the BBC operates and so she came over for a chat we talked for about an hour and a half

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,400
and it was hours love it when you know she's using a mini disc to record and I always love the

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,600
the kit they give these these producers when they go on the road you know the big old fashion

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,280
stick microphone with a big windscreen and the big radio one might cube that looks so professional

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,720
so we had a nice chat about podcast and that's for something in an air pretty soon and I'll be

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,320
sure to you know point you towards that because apparently the BBC really is getting into podcasting

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,120
and it's interesting she said that just last week they finally gave her a computer that actually

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,720
wasn't able to do sound so you know it's not like they've been working on this for a long time

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,960
but they're getting into it and the mission that has come down as I understood from Alice

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,200
this producer is that the BBC really wants to you know bring the interactive departments and the

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,520
the current program creation departments closer together so that's good news and they're also

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,000
supposed to suppose to think out of the box and start thinking about programming that may not

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,800
make it on the air that should only be for podcast and that's beautiful because that is exactly

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,440
what I think the BBC should be doing and they have that's almost in their charter statement that

29
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,480
they have to use any means of distribution available to them and Lord knows it's enough people who

30
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,920
work there so I'm sure they can come up with some great podcasts in the near future I'm looking

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,120
forward to it and not just you know re broadcasting radio shows as podcasts you can hear the

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,760
con ver in the background that have it on setting one flaps one on the con ver which reminds me of

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,440
this this past weekend so the wind command was on vacation but one of his his good buddies yapp

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,960
who was a we're flown with before he picked up the 1802 RG and Antwerp and then flew to

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Rotterdam picked up the in-laws who are going to be staying here during our vacation but since

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,280
Patricia and I had this night out when you know we said I want you come over and then you can keep an

37
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
eye on things what we're gone and Christina of course will be here and we still don't really feel

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,640
comfortable leaving a almost 15 year old alone in the house overnight so he brought him over and

39
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
they it was their first flight in a small aircraft and he did him just this you know

40
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,080
took him up above the clouds no turbulence did a nice little sightseeing tour over London down the

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,520
tabs and then over to to pharaohs which is our airport about 15 minutes from the house from the cottage

42
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,360
and I met them there and then they went back in a cab and then I basically spent the rest of the day

43
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,720
flying and it was f***ing fantastic I'm sorry got a lot of email about use of the word f***ing

44
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,320
I have to say it's a it's a it's a fun word to use you know I don't use it to

45
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,800
for any other reason it just sounds good and it's a it's a way of expressing myself and it's just a

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,040
word is not going to cut you and make you bleed okay but it was a really good time we did a lot of

47
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,120
navigation flying which means flying on instruments and not on the GPS and I went to Rochester airport

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,920
which is about I say about 30 miles probably from from pharaohs and just did lots of touching

49
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,120
goes and and you know had coffee at these different airports and that was really cool and

50
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,560
at the pilot shop because yeah but come over with only one pair of headsets and I didn't want to

51
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,960
you know look around to borrow a pair I needed my own pair anyway so I bought a great

52
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,600
Dave Clark I think it's a David Clark the David Clark headset it's Clark headset you know the

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:15,040
typical green green earpieces you know robust and I also bought in the pilot shop a Bluetooth

54
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,880
GPS receiver and I'd been playing around a little bit with some pocket PC applications that you

55
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,200
can download from around the internet without a GPS receiver connected because this is one thing

56
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:34,160
called pocket FMS which stands for flight management system it's an open source project where everything

57
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,840
is open source the program is open source all the the nav data the maps it's just everyone

58
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,800
contributes to this huge database and it's amazingly accurate and for GPS certainly and it's it's just

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,080
it's got everything you would really want as a pilot in your flight management system and the way you

60
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:01,600
set it up with with your your flight plan your waypoints you know all the frequencies are there

61
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,640
it has a moving map you can zoom in you can select what you do or don't want to see it shows

62
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:13,680
all the symbols that you want as a pilot highly configurable and then I just start hunting around

63
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,040
for stuff online of course now I hooked it up right and so I was able to kind of see me walking

64
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,560
down the street is a little plain moving just a couple of centimeters on the moving map but there's

65
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,920
a huge rush right now with the introduction of the Google Maps API and of course my

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,800
sound seeing tour San Francisco already introduced me to this got lots of feedback and email from

67
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,800
people talking about this Google Maps API where if you have the the navigational data which comes

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,480
in these formats called M E N M E A or November Mike echo alpha then there's G S X where's the

69
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,680
or G P X the G P X data exchange format there's all these different formats of course it's a little

70
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,760
convoluted but once you kind of figure your way through it there are ways to actually take data

71
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,400
from a GPS and hooked that into a Google Maps so that you can see the entire route that you travel

72
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,360
and you can do that with the satellite pictures as well if you want and you can even put in way

73
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
points that can include a picture of of something that you took at that particular spot

74
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,440
and I'm just learning now how to do all this I thought it was going to be really complicated

75
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,480
and you had to connect your camera to your GPS but it's much simpler than that because the GPS

76
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:35,440
basically records the longitude and latitude but also the time of day based on UTC time

77
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,840
when you were there so if you take a camera and your camera is kind of set to the same time as your

78
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,760
GPS that data in just about every single digital camera these days of course not in the

79
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,840
built-in camera on the XDA which was quite a disappointment but I have a different digital

80
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,000
camera and E X and more whatever it is and it has all that data right there in it it has the time

81
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,720
of day data stamped into the file so it'll automatically sync up and you can create these automatic

82
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,320
waypoints and there's a lot of learning to do still and actually I found that Koso he's the

83
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,000
the guy known as pod bad or blog he of course you know I looked for you know GPS data and google

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,640
maps API is a Google search and he popped up with something called jeepster as in golf echo

85
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:30,640
papa siera tango echo romio so GPS based site and he's done exactly this he's got like these

86
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,640
google maps that he's hacked together with this thing called what is it the GPS tuner which is a

87
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,680
piece of software and so he's taken the output from that loading it into the google maps API

88
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,640
you can also load into google earth and you can do flybys of of the routes that you did it's just

89
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,320
I mean it's it's mind boggling this stuff I showed it to Patricia last night and she kind of went

90
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,400
oh okay so it may not be for a very big audience I'm not quite sure if it's going to be that

91
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,040
compelling but it's certainly a major geek thing to do and I'm really loving it so I'm just

92
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,520
going to look out for all kinds of programs that that can tile this stuff together and I'll be

93
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,800
uploading some experiments very soon there's also a site called magna log dot com or magna locks I

94
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,680
think magna log or magna locks dot com and they have it that's a pretty cool project you can upload

95
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,520
your NMEA data and your picture is although you know it's very limited it's to kind of like an

96
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,880
attest and you can't upload high resolution pictures and you only can upload up to 200k worth

97
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,160
of data so I mean I gladly pay the guides to use as tools because the tools are great they're really

98
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,360
rock so I spent a lot of time geeking out hooking up this this Bluetooth and man Bluetooth has come

99
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,640
a long way it's really working I have Route 66 on my Mac and I connected the Bluetooth receiver to

100
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,800
that and so when you know I've gotten the car drove around and you could actually see myself moving

101
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,680
on the map and it's kind of exciting you know there's something about these especially the Google

102
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,400
Maps API that's really what's going to blow this wide open I think and there's a lot of hacking

103
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,080
going on I'm just trying to jump into this community now and I can really see that once again I'm

104
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,960
very happy I have the MDA3 because it it allows me to to do all this cool stuff in a very compact

105
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,000
format and just take it with me so look for me to be data logging all kinds of stuff in fact

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,520
what I'll do is I'll log the route to London that we take and then I'll also log the route

107
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:47,440
from our hotel to the party at its secret location okay so what is the time that's about 10 minutes

108
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,480
this was just an update I just didn't have time to do all the normal preparation so I figured I just

109
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,640
give you a load on what's going on so it's going to be a fun night tonight again sound

110
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,280
seeing tour will be recorded and we'll be editing that sometime tomorrow and uploading that

111
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,920
the new pod finder just want to let you know we're skipping one week because we want to

112
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,680
go on a different production schedule which means we'll we'll basically close production by Friday

113
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Saturday morning at the latest and then Tuesday is when the new shows come out so we're not going

114
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,240
to have one tomorrow but there will be a new one in a week from tomorrow and we also have a new

115
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,600
spike lead podcast coming out that will come out tomorrow so that's episode number three in the

116
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,240
shadow cast of the indie man movie podcast that we've been doing with Spike Lee so look out for that

117
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,840
and I will be back tomorrow with your daddy source code thank you very much for subscribing sorry

118
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,160
this was so short I'm sorry I had to ruin your commute maybe should go find another great podcast

119
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,680
to listen to I'm sure you've got something on your iPod or your MP3 player don't you

120
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
talk to you tomorrow
