1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta share Charlie 2-3-2.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're DJ.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And it is August 31st, 2005.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I almost want to do a Spike Lee there and say it's August 31st.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In the year of our lower 2005.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's Wednesday for the Daily Source Code.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We've got a real pressure cooker going on here in Gilford in Curry Cottage.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Not only the Convair, but now I have additional redundant backup fan running as well.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's like 31 degrees centigrade today.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's too hot.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It is 10 minutes before 3, so my timing of course is excellent.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's always got a record in the afternoon when the sun is shining right through the bedroom window.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The studio Cottage.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The second bedroom course.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's all because once again, not a really smooth night.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Patricia has this bronchial infection.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's the same thing I had in New York where she kind of skated through it.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She's got a bad man.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But she's got Panicillin.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So it's just a little bit of hacking and coughing at night that keeps us away.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So we slept in and it was nice.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think we woke up around 9.30pm until 10.30pm.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Of course we're still enjoying the fact that Christina has vacation from school.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She starts on Monday and she's enjoying it as well.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She's laying out in the backyard, sunbathing.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's kind of cool because she's been going into town almost every single day.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And she said, you know what, guys, I'll stay home with you today.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm going to sit in the sun.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We'll have some more parental teenager talks today in the show.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Amongst other topics of course.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because you've been sending a lot of interesting feedback.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll continue a bit on the bio diesel stuff.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And as I said, the teenager conversation.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Promo's coming away in a nice and mellow pod save tomb.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And to kick it off today with the mashup.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is one that art from mashuptown.com sent me a couple days ago.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I've heard people talking about it, but I hadn't actually heard it myself.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But I picked it up, I was like, oh yeah.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, I'm digging this.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The doors take a walk down Sesame Street.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mashup by Pilsher.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And of course brought to you by mashuptown.com.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Just listen to this man.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Totally gonna love him.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
See you tomorrow.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:30,000
See you tomorrow.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,480
But I know that I am a vet...

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:33,940
We are beating...

55
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,280
But I know that I am a vet...

56
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,620
But I know that I...

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,160
DIE!

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey, call me my guy tonight

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's the boy face, baby, you'll win now

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They all want me, you'll be dead as me

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So they're awesome, that's me, that's me

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not the boy

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not the boy

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not the boy, I'm not the boy

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not the boy

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:08:12,000
ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, set, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to finish, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready,

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
street, uh, piled shirt. So that's the doors, uh, the Menamanagai, which, of course,

84
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
as universal goes back to my youth, you can pretty much stand in a street corner anywhere

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
in the United States and go Menamanagai. And someone will go,

86
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t little macaroni and a thrown in. And as an experiment,

87
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
uh, today, I'm going to put in links to, um, the originals that are heard in the mashup,

88
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and in the hit test as well. We have a hit test today, y'all pull that, uh, sending a man every

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
single day now. Um, I still haven't been approved for iTunes music store to be in a

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
city, so I put in, um, links to yesterday's hit test from Amazon. And of course,

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I've been doing a great, almost this young palette sending me an instant message,

92
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
uh, y'all doing the show. I'll do the show back to you later. Um, I've been doing

93
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
great business with Amazon with the, uh, with the senseo coffee makers. I'm telling you,

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I make about a hundred to two hundred bucks a month on selling, uh,

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
selling senseo. Um, so I'll put that in the extended outline of the show notes.

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You notice now that I have, um, uh, show notes that just do the top level

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
notes of the outline that are embedded into the weblog, which, of course,

98
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
also become the description for the RSS feeds so that that pops up in iTunes.

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And then it has a link there if you want to, uh, go to the full outline.

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And that's where I'm going to put, uh, the links in to the, uh, to the music.

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And I'll see, I'll, I'll let, you know, exactly what I'm selling. If anyone

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
clicks on those. Because these, of course, are CDs. You know, uh,

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
some of them second hand from Amazon. So it's a little different than purchasing an

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
iTunes music track. But I'm sure that eventually I'll get approved. I would

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
hope. Uh, as a part of the continuing, um,

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
experiment that is the show notes. And this, I'm, I'm totally

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
living in outlines these days because there's so much to do. I've outlines for

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Pod Show. I've personal outlines. I, I just keep lists everywhere and try to

109
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
merge them all together because I'm always coming up with ideas for the source

110
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
of some other show or anything. You know, so just I got to keep lists all over the place.

111
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Kevin Crossman, uh, as did many other people sent me an email. He said, uh,

112
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
didn't like the new show notes form at it first, but I do like seeing the text of the email.

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So, uh, net positive at this point. Uh, but then he goes on to say,

114
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
it wasn't a big deal for me. A podcast was email address all over the net,

115
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
but those, uh, others might object to you posting their email addresses in the show notes.

116
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Um, and, uh, I didn't even think about it. I mean, I,

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
my email address is so out there that, uh, although I must say spam has gotten pretty

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
good. Gmail is doing a reasonable job for me on that. Maybe only ten or

119
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
twenty a day, but, you know, nothing out of the ordinary. Uh, but yeah,

120
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
if you do leave your email address out, it can get harvested and can get

121
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
spammed. I hadn't even thought of it that way. I thought maybe just pure privacy

122
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
issues. No one really seems to have much of a problem with that. Anyway,

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've taken, uh, the, uh, the most safest, um, uh, track in this,

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and I've just deleted all email addresses, uh, from the show mode to show notes,

125
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
but I still like putting the, the actual emails in there. And of course,

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
any links that are, uh, contained in that, um, do show up. So we're going to,

127
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
keep it going this way. And also I'll put in a,

128
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
a link to a real opium alpha. I link to the MP3. Okay.

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's Wednesday. Um, and,

130
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and yesterday, we just touched briefly on, um,

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
the damage that Hurricane Katrina has done.

132
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And already today, the podcast community is responding,

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and I think it's important that we talk about this.

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hello, it's me,

135
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
which you talk about the first. Hey, know what?

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Nothing's funny today.

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Has caused that hurricane to head down there.

138
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, here's bad. Now, now you're saying it on the news and stuff.

139
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And there's a bunch of people down there, the lies is tore up.

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They ain't got an ass to live in. Nothing to eat.

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Nothing to drink.

142
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ain't got no nothing.

143
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No clothes. They don't need some help.

144
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They really are. Now, if you be so kind,

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
it's a go like to the salvation army and give some clothes.

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Some old clothes or your shoes and stuff.

147
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Now, if you go red cross dot org,

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and it's given some money or some time and years,

149
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that'd be so good.

150
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If you could do that, you'd just be precious.

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Because they need some help.

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I think we ought to just lean into it and give them some help.

153
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'd really appreciate it.

154
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I know they would. Do you know what?

155
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You would do.

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, this is Richard Tolberat.

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I've heard him as scenes.

158
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
All right.

159
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you very much.

160
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Richard Tolberat, the third from the five minutes with

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Richard Tolberat, the third podcast.

162
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And Richard Tolberat and I've had a kind of an offline email

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
conversation.

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
How stupid does that sound?

165
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Offline email conversation, email conversation,

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
but not being podcast yet.

167
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
His idea is to do some sort of podathon

168
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
for the victims of Katrina.

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And he says, you know,

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
we can pull the serious satellite into.

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We can do stuff there.

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I've, you know,

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I've just been thinking,

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
what can we do with this?

175
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Because we do have a great community of podcasts.

176
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I might, first of all,

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think we have to establish at the best place right now

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
to lend your supporters to the American Red Cross.

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's red cross dot org.

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And of course, I have a link to that in my show notes.

181
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And if you,

182
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you can either help out with your own time.

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I think donating blood is,

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
is a useful option from what I've understood.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And definitely donating money.

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And I,

187
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know if it's going to,

188
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't know how we'd put a podathon together

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
because the whole asynchronous nature

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and not live nature of podcast.

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Doesn't really lend itself so well.

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But maybe if we all just really promote

193
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
the red cross dot org and,

194
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you know,

195
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
given whatever you can,

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
a couple bucks,

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
anything that you can offer

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
will make a difference.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If there's other organizations

200
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
that we should be aware of,

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
then let me know,

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
just send it to atamaccurry.com

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and we'll start plugging them.

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I think that the best thing we can do right now

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
in,

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
in the podcasting universe

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
is to make these kinds of public service announcements

208
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and just to disperse them

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
so that anyone with a podcast can just easily

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
pick up an MB3,

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
play it,

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and we'll be helping out.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll be happy to make some myself as well.

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I just really like to know,

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
what is the best thing we can do?

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is the,

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
what is the best way that you can help?

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Particularly if you're just sitting in your easy armchair

219
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and don't want to go down,

220
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I tell you,

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
if I had a helicopter

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and I was in Louisiana,

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I know what I'd be doing right now.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's for sure.

225
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But in this case,

226
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I guess donating money is the best way to help.

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So if there's other ways,

228
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
let me know,

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and then I think we should start cutting promos

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and distributing those far and wide.

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And if you have any ideas

232
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
of how we could do something

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
with all the podcasters

234
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and with the serious satellite radio,

235
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and we should probably do that next week.

236
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So after the Labor Day weekend,

237
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and you know,

238
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
by then lots of the relief efforts

239
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and the news were probably have been moved on

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
to the next horrible event in the world,

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
but the money and relief efforts

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
will still be needed.

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So I think there'll probably be a great time

244
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
to do something and a happily

245
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
offer up the serious radio time

246
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and I know which at all will as well.

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So just drop us a mail.

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let us know what we can do.

249
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And just to prove the point

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that people are thinking about this,

251
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
a couple more hurricane relief

252
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
public service announcements.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We're all concerned with the disaster

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
from Hurricane Katrina.

255
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000

This is Dave from the Dave's Lounge podcast

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
at Dave's Lounge.com.

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The devastation brought by Hurricane Katrina

287
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
along the Gulf Coast of the United States

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is torn apart countless families

289
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and left hundreds of thousands of people

290
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
with no homes, no livelihoods,

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and little hope for the future.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The American Red Cross

293
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
is now undertaking the largest disaster recovery operation

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
in its history.

295
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And now more than ever,

296
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
this organization needs your support.

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The Red Cross currently needs money

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
for rescue boats, power generators,

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
search and rescue equipment,

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
drinking water,

301
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and other supplies necessary to save lives

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and rebuild towns.

303
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Please go to www.redcross.org

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
to donate to their hurricane 2005 food.

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If you are unable to give money,

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
please consider donating blood.

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Contact your local Red Cross chapter

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
for information on upcoming blood threats.

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Please help the victims of hurricane Katrina

310
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
because in times of crisis,

311
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
all we really have is each other.

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Thank you.

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And that, by the way, is the American way.

314
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That is what Americans always do

315
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
we're always pitching in to help our neighbors.

316
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm not saying that other countries don't do it,

317
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
but it's the strongest in the United States of America.

318
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So two great public service announcements there

319
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and I agree, I think the best thing you can do

320
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
is just send it off us and off your donation to the Red Cross.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm pretty sure you can even do it with PayPal.

322
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I got a check.

323
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I haven't made my own donation yet.

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I just want to make sure that I'm donating to the right organization,

325
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
but it seems like Red Cross is the way to go.

326
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I was going to say.

327
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah.

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I really, at the pod of thorn,

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
you know, keeping totals of how much you raise

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
that seems so egotistical.

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You know, I just want to bypass everything

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and get everyone focused on going to one website,

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Red Cross.org as the best example I have now

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and donate money.

335
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay.

336
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Right.

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I got to say after hearing that promo,

338
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I immediately went to the pod safe music network

339
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and got a really mellow tune for today.

340
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I just had a real mellow vibe and so hot.

341
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
A little more on bio diesel.

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm talking about this,

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that I'm turning into a big fan of bio diesel

344
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
where you just take a crap in your tank and your engine runs

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
or something like that or you throw your old vegetable oil in there

346
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and it's all kinds of ways to make bio diesel.

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
My cross of news is free.com wrote me.

348
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It says about the current state of oil supply,

349
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
there's this thing called tar sands,

350
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
basically oil,

351
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
which was not trapped under a non porous layer of rock,

352
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
so the liquid and gas part is evaporated,

353
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
leaving only tar in sand type soil.

354
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay.

355
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I've seen that before.

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I've had it on my feet.

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Loads of that in Canada more than in Gulf,

358
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
apparently, in the Gulf, I guess.

359
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And we know exactly where it is.

360
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Getting the oil out of that is expensive though.

361
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You can't pump it.

362
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's more like mining.

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We've cost about 45 bucks a barrel.

364
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But with the current price of oil,

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
it wouldn't be economically viable.

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Of course, this means more oil related to pollution

367
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
for a longer time.

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Bloody bloody bloody bloody brown.

369
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay.

370
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So that's just a little bit of info.

371
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And of course, I'm posting all these in the show notes.

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So you can read them without email addresses.

373
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Great link from Tom Schuuring.

374
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He maintains my old radio days website,

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
which I really appreciate.

376
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He recently sent me,

377
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
you know, I think I told you about this.

378
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I sent him a whole box, a huge cardboard box

379
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to Australia of old cassette tapes of all my radio shows.

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And he digitized them all, put him up as a podcast.

381
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And he sent me, I think, four or five DVDs with my entire,

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
you know, just or a large bit of my radio career archive.

383
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Which is so incredibly nice.

384
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So he has a great link to a pizza shop

385
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that uses their excess oil every month for their car.

386
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Using that as biodiesel, just dilute it a little bit,

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
drop it right in.

388
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, this one's in the wrong spot.

389
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't want to have that one there.

390
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And then this was interesting.

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Paul Clark says this may sound stupid.

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And you can dismiss it if you like,

393
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but I've been receiving numerous emails about a rumor

394
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
that a not a drop day will be held on September 1st,

395
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
not a drop day convincing people to not buy gas

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
forcing the oil companies to lower their prices.

397
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You live in the UK.

398
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You pay a lot more for petrol than we do here in the States.

399
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
If you feel it's a notable cause,

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
maybe give a little leap out to your viewers,

401
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
while listeners then this case.

402
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't know if that helps.

403
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I really don't.

404
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I mean, it's this whole thing.

405
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It was pointed out to me through listener feedback

406
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
that the price of oil is determined in free open markets.

407
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And it's supply and demand.

408
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And it's just clear what's happening.

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
There's worry for the demand and for the increasing supply.

410
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So we've got some problems.

411
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But I guess at some point we're going to have to give up the SUVs.

412
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We got to give up the Hummer.

413
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I know I'm getting rid of this Audi.

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I think I can get rid of it because I least it for three years.

415
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And I want to get rid of it as soon as possible.

416
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's way overqualified for our mission.

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
As I said, I want to diesel.

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I want something I can just throw some junk into the tank.

419
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You know, not necessarily.

420
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, yeah, just a proof of point, I guess.

421
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You got to start somewhere.

422
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Right.

423
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We talked about the Cessna 182 versus the Cirrus SR22.

424
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And Nigel says, we're just listening to your show.

425
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You mentioned the SR22, my pals at test pilot for it.

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I went up for a test flight with him.

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
A real test flight?

428
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Or was it certified by that?

429
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's actually a great plane.

430
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't knock it.

431
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You also mentioned the plane is destroyed after shoot deployment

432
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and landing.

433
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Not true.

434
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The landing gear only needed replacing in several tests

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
performed in Minnesota.

436
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Besides, it gives a crap about the state of the plane when you survived.

437
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You know what it is?

438
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I think with the Cirrus besides the entire wing construction.

439
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
If you ever see a Cirrus SR22,

440
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
ask the owner's permission first.

441
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But stand on, go to one wing and just jolt it up and down like

442
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
like you were having turbulence.

443
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And then listen to what the sound to the sound the wings make.

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It just it freaks me out.

445
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Now, this plane is beautiful.

446
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's got the full glass cockpit.

447
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You don't have a yolk.

448
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You really, well, you have a stick right on the left hand side.

449
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Very much like an airbus does to control it.

450
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think I'm just one of those old fashioned guys.

451
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You know, I was taught in the old fashioned by old fashioned pilots.

452
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The wing commander, of course.

453
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I, you know, I really like, I really like the old avionics.

454
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I mean, yeah, of course a GPS with autopilot.

455
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Of course, that's wonderful.

456
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But just for the pure flying of it,

457
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I really love, you know, getting the VORs and getting,

458
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and picking up ILSs and but doing it on the old.

459
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You know, kind of like the World War II is,

460
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I feel much more in touch with the actual flight than doing everything

461
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
through a glass cockpit.

462
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And I'd like a yolk much more.

463
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And I think that really if you compare the two aircraft,

464
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
the SESN and 182RG and the CRS SR22.

465
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And you want to take, you know, take four full grown adults and baggage.

466
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think you're going to want the SESN out,

467
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
particularly with the black edition engine that I'm getting put in.

468
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So I think I think that's going to be a better utility plane.

469
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Now if you want to pick up chicks, the SR22 is, of course,

470
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
completely the way to go.

471
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
A little bit more on the teenagers conversation.

472
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Rishub Kumar, who I think emails Christina a lot.

473
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
He says is a big difference between teenage guys and girls.

474
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And he says, it's just me as a scene that more than 95% of advertisements

475
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
on television are directed at girls.

476
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Girls seem to do almost nothing, but talk about fashion.

477
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And guys, well, advertising is in my opinion,

478
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
turning today's girls into fashion zombies.

479
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And you got to read this.

480
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
This is a, okay.

481
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The more I read feedback from teenagers who are listening to the source code,

482
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
the more I realize that, well, this two parts to it.

483
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
One is, yeah, this is exactly the age when you are emancipating.

484
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And I could see it with Christina.

485
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And she wants to be all grown up.

486
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And we're sitting here watching TV, watching the news,

487
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
seeing what happens to kids and all kinds of crazy stuff from,

488
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
you know, drinking to murders, you know,

489
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and you just get freaked out.

490
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You know, kids can certainly understand that.

491
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And of course you think, ah, nothing's going to happen.

492
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But it happens to someone.

493
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And this is it.

494
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
For Patricia and I, this is the kick, the bird out of the nest stage.

495
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And it's, it's, it's definitely, it's complicated.

496
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It really, obviously.

497
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Honor you up here.

498
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Hi.

499
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I want to get Patricia back on the podcast.

500
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Because I think it's great when she comes in to roast me.

501
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
She has some always has interesting things to say.

502
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And I wanted to talk to her about this on the show.

503
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You know what, I'm going to see if I can, well,

504
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
if she walks upstairs, I'll pull her in.

505
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And Field said that he saw my show notes yesterday that I was going to talk about the MTB video,

506
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
musical awards.

507
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I guess I didn't, you know,

508
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
did he, of course, the artist formerly known as PDD hosted the show.

509
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And, and I, it's finally dawned on me.

510
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He doesn't really have any talent.

511
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And I think that's what really brought the show down.

512
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I mean, I've been going to video musical awards,

513
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and it've been in the minute of co-hosted them for a long time.

514
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And, you know, first of all, the video,

515
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
there's supposed to be a lot less slick, you know,

516
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and you always had to have someone beating up on someone else

517
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
for, you know, going out with their girlfriend.

518
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We haven't had any of that.

519
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And, you know, so now it's the bad words, you know,

520
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
it's like the fox and the shits and the whatever and the mother fuckers.

521
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And so that's like, and it gets applause.

522
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's unbelievable.

523
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You know, if that's the only thing you can do to say,

524
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
hey, we're bad.

525
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We're, we're anti-establishment,

526
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
which MTB clearly isn't anymore.

527
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And Peter, you know, he had, he had some,

528
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
what he does well as he surrounds himself

529
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
with very talented people, which, by the way,

530
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
is the right way to go.

531
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And so he's got, you know, he had a couple of great dance routines,

532
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
which he didn't do too much of the dancing in,

533
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
but it, you know, it's surrounded him,

534
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and that was really good.

535
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
He didn't really have any great jokes.

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Okay, so he gave away his watch, you know,

537
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
he gave away probably a 40 or 50,000 dollar watch, you know.

538
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay, so that's this thing,

539
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
but he wasn't particularly funny.

540
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
There was no real writing done for him clearly.

541
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And that's, that's tough.

542
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You know, hosting an award show,

543
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I think it has to be more than just an image.

544
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You gotta, and I think really comedians are the way to go with that.

545
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And, and those are usually great hosts of great shows.

546
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So, there was that, and then it did seem very,

547
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
very R&B hip hop, rap oriented,

548
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and I don't think that reflects

549
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
the state of the music business.

550
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You know, we had a,

551
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
what do we have Green Day?

552
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Green Day was kind of a rock song,

553
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and we had the Gwen Stefani.

554
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh, Kelly Clarkson.

555
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
She, I mean, she was something went wrong with her.

556
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
She was like, first of all, I don't think her,

557
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't think her monitoring was right.

558
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
She couldn't, she didn't have the right sound

559
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
in her ears, because she was adjusting the audio pack the whole time.

560
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
She was really off-key, and just yelling,

561
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and the whole idea was cool,

562
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
but I didn't pan out the way I think she wanted it to.

563
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So, little disappointed by today's video music awards.

564
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And the other day I was talking about,

565
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
you know, how, if you look at MTV,

566
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
and you see the videos,

567
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
how it seems to be pretty much centered around being in the club,

568
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and everything's happening in the club,

569
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and we're going to the club,

570
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and we're successful,

571
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and I'm drinking in the club,

572
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and that's what all the songs about in the club.

573
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
We're totally welcome to picked up on it.

574
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
He sent me this little ditty.

575
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yo, what's up? This is Chris Rock,

576
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and I'm on my man, little John,

577
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and we stay in the club.

578
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
We live in the club.

579
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We die in the club.

580
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We get our car washed in the club.

581
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
We go to school in the club.

582
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We go to the cleaners in the club.

583
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We never live in a motherfucking club.

584
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We go to church in the club.

585
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We do everything in a motherfucking club.

586
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We pay our taxes in the club.

587
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We go to library in the club.

588
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yo, I think he's onto the same thing I'm on to.

589
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
This is in the club thing.

590
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
We got to stop with that.

591
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And we talked briefly about MP3 licensing.

592
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Drew sent me some feedback about that,

593
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and I've gotten this,

594
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
received this same recommendation from lots of other people.

595
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
There is a format out there,

596
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
the Aug Form at OGG,

597
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
which is comparable to MP3,

598
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
but doesn't have any of the patents on it.

599
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
From time to time,

600
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we'll get a whole slew of people asking me

601
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
to release the source code in the format like that.

602
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't think it's proliferated,

603
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
but when it does,

604
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
we should seriously consider it.

605
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Just keep in tabs on it.

606
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Congratulations to Donna Drew.

607
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Drew Domkis now,

608
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
a full-time podcaster.

609
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
He's given notice that his day job.

610
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And so he'll be living the day.

611
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He'll be living the day.

612
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He'll be living the day.

613
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
He'll be living the day.

614
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He'll be living the day.

615
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
He'll be living the day.

616
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He'll be living the day.

617
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
He'll be living the day.

618
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
He'll be living the day.

619
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
He'll be living the dream.

620
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
He will be podcasting and producing podcast full-time.

621
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And I congratulate both of them.

622
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And let's hang out soon, y'all.

623
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And finally,

624
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Sergei,

625
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
he says,

626
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
the title of his email,

627
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
TV screen brain melting.

628
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Remember, when I was a kid,

629
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
my parents used to say,

630
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
don't sit too close to the television.

631
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And don't watch more than an hour a day.

632
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
A friend of his been using computers for as long as he can remember.

633
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's his job.

634
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
He used the first PCs with a green and black screen.

635
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The TV screens and computer screens are basically the same thing.

636
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But the computers just sit close.

637
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Anyway, that's at least what he says.

638
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
There are some extremely low radiation monitors out there.

639
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I don't know if they're they're useful or not.

640
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But he's been sitting front of monitors every day day after day for years.

641
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Now,

642
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and now he's bald.

643
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And he started getting less hair in his early 20s.

644
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And his early 20s,

645
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
known as family has ever had problems with that.

646
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
After some research from medical websites and books,

647
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
he found out that the freaking screens made the problem.

648
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We just back off a little bit here from the Power book.

649
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I don't want to get any kind of problems.

650
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
This is the TV Talk podcast.

651
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm Davis.

652
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And I'm Mary.

653
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Every week from most part,

654
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
we chat in chat about the latest and greatest TV shows.

655
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Discuss the latest in TV news.

656
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And we compile our own weekly top 11 lists.

657
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Like for example,

658
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
our favorite TV characters,

659
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
favorite theme songs,

660
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and favorite TV villains.

661
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Every week we have a new one.

662
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And thankfully,

663
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
we try to avoid an annoying,

664
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
funny voice stick that plays so many other podcasts.

665
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We try to keep it real,

666
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
so to speak.

667
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Murph and I live on different coasts.

668
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Me and San Francisco,

669
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and Murph and Delaware.

670
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We go on the phone,

671
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and talk it up right now.

672
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
If you'd like to surprise us,

673
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
the key to our deadwood,

674
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
24, the shield,

675
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
lift up, survivor.

676
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The amazing rate.

677
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Big brother.

678
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Over there,

679
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Kirby and Suzie has them.

680
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000

Hey Adam.

687
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This is Eric Bergen from Green Room Radio.

688
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
The Arts and Entertainment Podcast.

689
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Located over at greenroomradio.com.

690
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I just wanted to sendo for a brief,

691
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
promo type thing,

692
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
just to let you know what's coming up on the show.

693
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Today,

694
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
we actually just put up a new show dedicated to the Muppets.

695
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You know,

696
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
season one was just released on DVD,

697
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and it's some pretty exciting stuff.

698
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I mean,

699
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
where else would you get to see Connie Steven singing

700
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
with Faussie Bear?

701
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So yeah,

702
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
so check that out.

703
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
There's some great stuff on there.

704
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Also coming up soon,

705
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
we have an exclusive backstage interview

706
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
with Julia Merney,

707
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
who is in that new Broadway musical

708
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Lenin,

709
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
based on the life of John Lenin.

710
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Many people think it's actually

711
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
based off the life of the Lenin sisters,

712
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
but that's not true.

713
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So yeah,

714
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
where we talk all about what it's like

715
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
to be in a Broadway show

716
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
that receives harsh criticism

717
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and all that.

718
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So it's really, really great.

719
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
We've some great stuff coming up.

720
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I also wanted to wish you a happy sweet

721
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
16.

722
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I know it's your birthday soon.

723
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And, you know,

724
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
sweet 16s are a big thing.

725
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Don't get knocked up if you can prevent it.

726
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Lastly,

727
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
well,

728
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I don't,

729
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
if you just indulge me for a second.

730
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You know,

731
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
you've had that,

732
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
that song recently on your show

733
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
by cruise box,

734
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
heard it on the podcast.

735
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And I,

736
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and I really think that that song

737
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
has one of the best messages I've heard

738
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
in a long time.

739
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It really truly is about the future.

740
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And it really just shows you

741
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
what kind of a revolution

742
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
this podcasting thing is,

743
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
is doing.

744
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Here's the thing.

745
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm a singer myself

746
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and I just think,

747
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
well,

748
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I just think I could do a better job on the song.

749
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Just,

750
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
just on the vocal part.

751
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If you just indulge me in a second,

752
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I just like to try this out.

753
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I heard it all the podcast.

754
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Fucking,

755
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
radio,

756
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
you want it.

757
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You got it.

758
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Now,

759
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
if you just got up.

760
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And I heard it all the podcast.

761
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah.

762
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah.

763
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh,

764
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I just like it.

765
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
No.

766
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay.

767
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I tried.

768
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
A fantastic.

769
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
We need that.

770
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
We need a whole cover version,

771
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
done just like that.

772
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That's fantastic.

773
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Why shouldn't we?

774
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The lyrics,

775
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
the melody.

776
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's all great.

777
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Let's do a couple different versions.

778
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Do you hear that gap

779
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
by the way,

780
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
between the first and the second promo?

781
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I got that crime scene evidence screen again.

782
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So,

783
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
let me see.

784
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Where does that happen?

785
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It happens.

786
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's the podshow disclaimer jingle.

787
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But whenever I play that,

788
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I get,

789
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I get the,

790
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
the whole,

791
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
whenever I play that in Megaseg,

792
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
the whole screen goes blank.

793
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Or black,

794
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I should say,

795
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
with huge white letters,

796
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
it says crime scene evidence.

797
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Let me just see if I can replicate that.

798
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Hold on a second.

799
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
If I go back to this.

800
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
This may be talk podcast.

801
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll just move this forward.

802
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Let's see if it happens again.

803
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Or on the pictures music store

804
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
on the name TV talk.

805
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, crime scene evidence.

806
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And then the Adam,

807
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
this is,

808
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and from green room radio,

809
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the arts and entertainment podcast.

810
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
How is that all right?

811
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Remain,

812
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Oh man.

813
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
OK.

814
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So, it's clearly,

815
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
it's the podshow idea,

816
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and has now been labeled as crime,

817
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
let me,

818
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
let me just go back.

819
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Let me do the,

820
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm going to take a screenshot of that.

821
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You won't believe it

822
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
what I'm seeing here.

823
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Hold on.

824
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Let me just do this podcast.

825
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Or on the ideas music store.

826
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
or under the name TV call.

827
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Got it. Got the screenshot.

828
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
This is Eric Bergen.

829
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Amazing.

830
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay. So we'll have to look at that.

831
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I was telling you about,

832
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Wait a minute, I have something written down here before I get to that.

833
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh yeah, Nintendo is going to start,

834
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
is really going to start a push into podcasting it appears.

835
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
They've started their own podcast,

836
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
the link to k9cast.com.

837
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But Walter wrote in to say the timing of this is interesting because the play,

838
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
young MP3 multimedia add-on player for the Nintendo DS and GBA.

839
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I have no idea what that is.

840
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
May see a US release date in late 2005 according to Wikipedia.

841
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Wikipedia is now more than in cyclopedia apparently.

842
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Nintendo could, it's a rumor mail.

843
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Nintendo could be planning to turn DS and GBAs into podcast players.

844
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
With over 50 million Game Boy Advance units sold,

845
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
that's a lot of listeners. That is very interesting.

846
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I got to find out with the DS and GBAs are,

847
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
but it sounds interesting.

848
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And of course, the other question is,

849
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
will people use the device for podcasts?

850
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Use it for gaming and stuff like that.

851
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And a lot of people are hacking into their PSPs.

852
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But if there is an audience there, that's a big number.

853
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That's for sure.

854
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And then finally, JPDane Castro says the other day I was driving in a car,

855
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
listening to the daily source code.

856
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And I went under an overpass.

857
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And for split second I thought to myself,

858
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
oh no, I'm going to lose reception.

859
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And then I remembered.

860
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's a podcast.

861
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You can't lose reception.

862
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That's the beauty.

863
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So I told you I was gotten a real mellow mood after I listened to the Hurricane Katrina PSA

864
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
from Dave's lounge.

865
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And I remembered I had heard this particular song

866
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
on accident-C-C Chapman's show,

867
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
as he got back from San Francisco to Boston to the whole mellow show.

868
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's a Zach Ashton.

869
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Tonight, I cry alone.

870
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Tonight, I am forgotten.

871
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Tonight, I cry alone.

872
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Tonight, I am forgotten.

873
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
For I run to you, run to you, run to you.

874
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But I know, I know.

875
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It won't be home, no, no.

876
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Tonight, I'm asleep alone.

877
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And you're voice-in, so familiar.

878
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Tonight, I am so old.

879
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I want to have you.

880
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But feelings anymore.

881
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Tonight, I am so old.

882
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Tonight, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

883
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Tonight, I am so old.

884
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Tonight, I am so old.

885
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I want to have you.

886
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Tonight, I am so old.

887
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Tonight, I am so old.

Hold on a second.

900
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Do you have both channels now?

00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500

00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
I don't hear one channel.

904
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Oh, hello?

00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,540
Did you think it was better? I like it. Yeah, it was kind of mellow. It was sweet. Yeah, it was

917
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:28,580
very sweet. So I finally found Patricia. I was doing the garbage bags. Oh really?

918
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,500
Yeah. What does that mean? Also if people, if a glimmer is people, need to do

919
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,700
the garbage bags. Well, you don't need to do the garbage. Well, there are people

920
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,380
don't have to do it. Yeah. But I did that for a while and that was actually very

921
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,740
boring. And I'm misdoing the garbage bags. Oh, yeah. You mean you misdoing? Oh,

922
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,700
you mean you had someone do it for you. And then you, and now you, I was actually

923
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:57,300
missing doing, you know, the normal stuff. Really? Yeah. I didn't mis the garbage

924
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,340
bag part. No, you hated. I know that. It's, it's, you keep thinking about when

925
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,860
you were young. My parents always need to take out the garbage. I had, I was trash man.

926
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:14,500
He trashed. He trashed. I swear to God. And my, my dad would always do this. Oh, it's

927
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:19,860
Tuesday night. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no trash man. Really? Oh, they made it

928
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:25,060
you know, fun. Very irritating. Very irritating. Extremely freaking irritating. Well, it was typical.

929
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,780
How old was I then? I was probably 14, 15. You know, I've been talking about teenagers,

930
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:36,660
parents. That trash boy. It was trash man. It was trash man. Yeah, that's true. So they were trying to make me feel

931
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,900
good. Okay. I was just saying how teenagers now, you know, they, they think they know it all.

932
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,620
And then we're parents who don't want to push the bird out of the nest yet. Yeah, but we, we thought we

933
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:56,580
knew it all too. It was exactly. But not so extremely as the kids right now. What do you mean?

934
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:06,500
Yeah. Well, they, they, they, they, they exo mature. Yeah. Well, it, it looks mature, but it's not really,

935
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,740
but you know what I mean? They want to what they want to be mature. I don't know. Well, because they

936
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:18,580
see all those videos, those, those music videos. You think that's it? It's all because of the club

937
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:25,460
the 16 and 14 year now. I really sound old. The 16 and 14 year olds that are in the

938
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:32,260
clip density, because they're very young. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're very. Yeah. And they just,

939
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,100
they look like all dancers and, and yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

940
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:44,580
And just, you know, it's sort of the street fashion. I'm so torn. The high street. And I don't

941
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:49,780
know, I think where is this going? Everybody's naked. I'm so torn because I like looking at it,

942
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:54,980
but I don't owe my daughter participate in it. And you know, I, I am always, I was always the first

943
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:01,620
one to hang on the pole. Not to hang on the pole, but you know, to do dairy things and, and being,

944
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:07,940
you know, one of the first that was wearing, actually before Madonna wearing those, underwear

945
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:14,020
things, you know, those bus jays. And, and, and I did, and there was quite sex. You know,

946
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,620
we thought that was quite naked. And I'm from the 70s where we showed, you know, we had those,

947
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:27,300
hip-hangers. Yeah. Very low. Right. But now it's going up, up, up, up, up. You know, and there's hardly

948
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,940
any t-shirt there. What's like the video music awards, everybody was, was pretty much naked. Yeah.

949
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:38,500
Yeah. I mean, go go on. With your swimsuit, who cares? Yeah. You know, next time, don't wear your,

00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,820

951
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,820
Is that our Kelly was doing? Yeah. I know they do a lot, and it's sort of a thing that

952
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:55,060

00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:17,340
the TTA and BOLET.com.

1009
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,340
I always love getting those feedback messages.

1010
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:25,340
I got a lot of them about the train hit test, recorded on a train,

1011
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,340
and I also got one from John Lason, and he states this.

1012
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,340
I was listening to the daily source code on my iPod at work,

1013
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,340
and when I heard the first couple of notes from on the beach,

1014
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,340
I shouted out the title, which invited more than a few curious stairs.

1015
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,340
From people's side of a beach.

1016
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,340
Hit test at Gmail.com.

1017
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,340
Is there something else to mention?

1018
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:56,340
Well, not really, I love the fact that the hit test is creating sales at iTunes

1019
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,340
or other music, offending sites and stores.

1020
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:07,340
I still haven't found a good way to monitor the links to every song on the site

1021
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,340
because it really takes a lot of time.

1022
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,340
Well, it's not important when you look at the amount of work

1023
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,340
that you have to do to get the link on the site.

1024
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,340
Okay, well, that might help you enjoy this hit test.

1025
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,340
Yeah, you've been doing it for 55 until then.

1026
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,340
Bye, bye.

1027
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,340
Thank you very much.

1028
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,340
Feel better, young.

1029
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,340
Yeah.

1030
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,340
What a trooper, eh?

1031
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,340
Nah, if you calculate.

1032
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,340
A few could choose.

1033
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,340
You're speaking Dutch on, just saying no.

1034
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,340
Yeah, I know, but I'm Dutch listening.

1035
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,340
Okay, all right.

1036
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,340
Think about that.

1037
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,340
This shows me no one for 15 minutes.

1038
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,340
I got to stop him.

1039
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,340
All right.

1040
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,340
Okay.

1041
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,340
Will you come by tomorrow again?

1042
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,340
You know, maybe.

1043
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,340
It's just the walk out of your bedroom, take the first left.

1044
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,340
You're going to talk a little louder.

1045
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,340
But I wasn't feeling well, you know.

1046
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,340
I know.

1047
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,340
Okay.

1048
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,340
Yeah, but it's better.

1049
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,340
I got to do something like the headphones.

1050
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,340
This is something.

1051
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,340
Yeah, be people.

1052
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,340
Very old fashioned.

1053
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,340
Yes.

1054
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,340
Very old fashioned.

1055
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,340
Okay, hon, thank you.

1056
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,340
Okay.

1057
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,340
Love you too.

1058
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,340
Okay, oh shit.

1059
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,340
There we go.

1060
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,340
That's it for today's source code.

1061
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,340
Hello.

1062
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,340
Hello, hello.

1063
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,340
Hello, hello.

1064
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,340
Hello.

1065
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,340
Hello.

1066
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,340
I just respect the other headphones here.

1067
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,340
Hold on.

1068
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,340
Okay, much better.

1069
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,340
I got that.

1070
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,340
That determines it.

1071
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,340
I need to hit so now.

1072
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,340
I need serious headphones amplifier.

1073
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,340
amplifier.

1074
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:43,480
They got the microphone part for the guess worked out, but not the, uh, not the headphone

1075
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,480
amp part.

1076
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,480
Okay.

1077
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:51,900

1078
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,560

00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,980
can use that information that sent it to Atom McCree.com.

1080
