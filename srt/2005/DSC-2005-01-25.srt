Daily source code 1 25 2005 transmitters we don't need no stinking transmittance

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,240
Autistic it's Adam Curry and it is Tuesday January 25th

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,360
Oh man always gotta think about that for a second what is the date today

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,440
Hi everybody welcome to the Daily source code coming to you from the affluent

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Surrey suburb

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,920
It's kill for that's right. It's curry cottage. My name is Adam Curry

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,280
This is your Daily source code for Tuesday January 25th

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,440
Good stuff to talk about today some techno bits. We're gonna be looking at

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,320
Looking at the cast blaster got some pod save tunes for you

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,040
And of course some promos some some wacky stuff all the stuff you'd expect from the Daily source code for the next 40 minutes

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,240
Taking you down on a journey from nowhere leading to nowhere

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,600
That's right as a constant we call it a show

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,320
I tell you um yesterday I got three calls from different news organizations and publications

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,520
It seems like we're going through kind of like a 2.0 round of press the press is not done with pod casting

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,920
I thought that we pretty much had everybody and and everybody had written their piece but

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,200
Seeing as this probably is not a passing fad they're coming back for more

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,560
If the BBC asked me for one more thing I'm gonna ask him to put me on the payroll

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,480
And BBC has so many different radio stations and programs and they seem to be

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Rather poorly co-op coordinated actually

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,920
Because they don't know you know one side doesn't know what the other side is doing and who is doing what show for what reason?

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,160
It's okay though because I don't mind the BBC is pretty much figured me out now

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,440
All you got to do is call Adam send him up to the

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,440
BBC SCR southern counties radio. That's it sirry university

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,440
They've got an ISD and set there. I sit down and and off we go

25
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,400
But even actually let me look on my calendar even for for this week and next week there's all kinds of stuff scheduled

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,440
But the angles are a little bit different you know now it's not how to this happen how this come to be now

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
They're looking for angles

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,440
Future you know where is podcasting going what are the big industries saying are they affected by it

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
So let me see next week USA today and

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
What did I have here?

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
I had something there. I think

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
CNN international

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,600
Hold on actually got to type that into the calendar there

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
CNN international this week

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
We still have

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Hold on I call it a little slow

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,840
Yeah, BBC technology show

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,840
Aramaica that's tomorrow afternoon that'll be a telephone interview that I try to turn them on to using the ISD and set

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,000
Because I know that the BBC rents it out commercially and I don't think we'll be able to do that

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But so Aramaica that should be fun

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,640
And it just keeps on coming and unfortunately next week USA today

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,640
Also wants to take a picture. I'm really worried about that if you heard yesterday's podcast you know why

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:31,360
Because well, I look like an idiot and I'm not I repeat I am not going to post a picture on

44
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,720
The weblog it's it's frightening if if if you want to have frightening just check out yes, there's podcast at the end there

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,440
We're Patricia was basically talking about

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Well, how ugly I look

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,640
So I can hear that the dogs are barking which means that something's going on hold on

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Okay gardening services are here

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,080
First things first yesterday Scott sent in some trivia. I completely sucked. I only got one right

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,960
Let's see if for those who're keeping track chili whack gone gone gone was the first track

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,280
Marty balan hearts should I should have known that would go west we closed our eyes. I got that one right and the fourth one

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,880
I can't believe I didn't get it of course. I knew this song, but it guess it was like the album version of something that I wasn't

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,000
familiar with at least not on the snippet of course prints and

54
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,760
Controversy and as I guess correctly ABC look of love

55
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,280
wound that up love the trivia stuff keep sending it in because

56
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
I love looking like a dish

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,680
Hello Adam. This is Ted here from TedPod.phone.ms podcasting from Ireland and I was just listening to your show and

58
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,840
Was listening to the guy given out about you trying to earn money and all that kind of oh, okay

59
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
This is about the

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,040
Was this Sunday show where I played this show has no name. I think is is the name of the show

61
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
I got was totally railing on me, but

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,760
And there you were trying to explain yourself. What you thought you don't have to explain yourself. So we all want to be the money if you get it

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
We all want to be the money

64
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,760
And

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,400
But at the same time you was right that your show can be an oin

66
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,000
You're right

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,760
Like anyone else's show can be and sure you can just turn it off a fast forward or maybe like

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,440
Exactly, but show mine can be an oin and if you want to take out how an oin it is

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
You know come to my website and have a look choose Adam

70
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,640
Excellent, okay. That's a good way to get a promo on the air

71
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,960
But wait did you actually mention your promo at all is Adam? I don't think he mentioned his um his site

72
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Hold on a second I've been

73
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,600
Getting all these through mp3 feedback at gmail.com

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Let me see what was this

75
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,920
Was it Chris? I can't remember I'm I'm searching through this now

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Uh

77
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, shoot

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,760
You know what I'll put that in the in the show notes. That's what I'll do

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,120
So you know who that was and you just make a note right there that I

80
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Sight address

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm really starting to get better at the show notes

82
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,560
You probably notice now that I have a link to a real HTML page if you want to take a look at the show notes

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,640
The next step

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Really should be putting those in the actual post itself I guess instead of providing a link

85
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,040
And I'm just gonna keep on providing the opml file

86
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,800
Because I got it, you know, it's like the raw data so it's XML so it's totally parsable

87
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,640
So there are things that you can that you can do with it. I'm the way we're gonna listen to

88
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,920
A bit of a podcast from event lab where one of the pod squad showed up and

89
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
And

90
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Another promo here hold on saying a

91
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,760
Hawaii atom this is John from legal sound check

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,160
Where we feature law plus music in less than seven minutes

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,840
I'd like to add a bit of the lawyers voice. Oh, last second

94
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,120
Lawyers who do anything that lasts only seven minutes this is a podcast I must hear and by the way

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Do you charge by the minute or just by the hour and chop it up in a 10 minute chunks legal equation

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,400
We also throw some music into a sort of boardroom mix and type things up rather quickly before I commit corporate career

97
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,080
Hericary

98
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,600
Legal sound check is available under the law category on your ipodder.org directory

99
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,760
You know you really set the bar high on the daily source code atom many thanks for your hard work and innovation

100
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
And if you ever need any kind of legal help

101
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
Let me know

102
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
There are three things I'll send you straight away

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
My

104
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,440
That's right send lawyers guns and money. That's all we need that'll see

105
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Most action

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
That's good to see

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,480
You know some

108
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Professions some

109
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,280
Legal profession coming into podcasting indeed

110
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,720
I think there's two podcasts listed in the ipodder.org directory

111
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
That's where you can find

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,920
We'll find any podcast basically categorized by

113
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,240
By topic man. It's a lot of noise in the studio here today people

114
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
Talks barking people going nuts. It's a one 42 by the way in the afternoon

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
Patricia and I went to the doctor this morning

116
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,760
Bright and early she has to get some prescription for her meds

117
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,640
And so I figured I'd go in as well, you know, and the peed in the little cup and everything

118
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,480
Mys will sign up with a doctor here although I gave I get a annual physical for my pilot's license

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,920
So I know that I'm pretty much okay in fact

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:55,280
My next checkup is due. What does it do? July. Oh, I also got in touch with the guys from cab air aviation

121
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,080
They're the ones that have the flight school up at black bush

122
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,240
So next week I have an appointment going to go up there going to drink some coffee going to kick some tires and

123
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,920
Hopefully work on you know

124
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,840
Finding the right instructor to help me complete the add-on for my

125
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,760
PPL for my pilot's license. You know, I have the helicopter license just want to get the fixed wing portion now

126
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
It's a lot easier actually

127
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,440
If you already have one license because you don't have to go through all the theory again

128
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,120
Don't have to do the test for that

129
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,200
I have to be signed off on have to do the check, you know, I have to demonstrate that I can really fly

130
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,720
And then it's just building up experience, you know, it's renting a plane and going going

131
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Not stopping

132
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,720
until well just not stopping flying take off landing

133
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,720
Navigating

134
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,760
Navigating is not a big deal because I've well I have a GPS

135
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,720
But you know, I've flown I have like six or seven hundred hours that I've flown

136
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,480
Many of which solo so navigation is not an issue in fact in in helicopter navigation sucks because you've got

137
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,080
Basically your hands and feet tight up all the time you can take your hand off the collective

138
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,640
And you know and lock the friction down so you can you know basically

139
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,720
Have one hand free to touch controls or whatever you need to do but

140
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,400
In an airplane it's like you know metal to metal get that fucker in the air it rotates speed

141
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
Just pull back on the stick it goes up you flip on the auto autopilot and

142
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
That's what the asteroids are for after that, right?

143
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,120
Anyway, so that's that's next week. I'm sure we're doing some sound seeing or something from there

144
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,080
And I came across a podcast from event lab

145
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,000
And it was interesting because there were a couple of people in this podcast who I knew Eric Rice was on this podcast

146
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
And I've actually

147
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,000
Drop this podcast into a new feed which we'll be talking about in a second

148
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Because you should really listen to the whole thing. It's it's like an over an hour

149
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,440
But in this show on the phone or on I think it was on the phone or on Skype all of a sudden who shows up?

150
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,880
But our good buddy member of the pod squad Michael go hey gohagan

151
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,960
They even started off the show. How do I pronounce your name Michael gohagan

152
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,880
You know him from from real reviews and I'll just play a little snippet of it just to go to wet your appetite

153
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
And of course you'll find a link to

154
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
To this actual show in the show notes because he was saying a lot of really good things

155
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
We're talking about

156
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Making money with podcasts

157
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,200
What you have to do to evangelize it. How you actually record your podcast what you need for a podcast and also just telling other people what podcasting is all about

158
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,200
I also though and aware that that means that it's gonna take a little bit longer

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
to explain to somebody

160
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Exactly what's going on

161
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,080
And so if I if I meet a friend as a Japanese yesterday, of course you go through the podcast thing

162
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,680
Oh, I have to have an iPod and you know, eventually they get it once they got it

163
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,040
You're set but at the same time if you you use radio

164
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Even though there's that word

165
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,440
Okay, I get it so it comes to me. Okay, you know then maybe you explain that it's stored on the computer and that type of thing

166
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,880
So as an example if I go to call a movie studio to ask for a screen or DVD and I'm real reviews from MWG blog a podcast

167
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,240
I'm gonna get one reaction as opposed to I'm calling for real reviews radio. Yeah exactly exactly we've talked about this before

168
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
I think even when it comes if you're doing stuff

169
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,880
on location for instance and you and you want to interview somebody

170
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,080
Part of the whole deal is you've got it, you know

171
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,320
You just got to have the right equipment. It has to look right doesn't have to cost the same as what the pros use

172
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,320
But essentially if you're gonna stick a mic in someone's face make sure it kind of has that professional look

173
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
You know, because that's you're gonna get a very different response from from some people

174
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,560
And of course you you may decide that you want to very you want someone to treat you as you know

175
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,640
Something not important and perhaps amateur or it's in that case. You might use a different type of microphone

176
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,040
Specifically for that reason the big thing though is the mic cube you gotta have the mic cube

177
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,080
Which slides up over the microphone and you know and the the big TV and radio guys have have their channel number on it or their call letters

178
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,040
Whatever

179
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
And so indeed if you say real reviews radio, you know, that's a

180
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,040
That's a sounds like a much bigger deal if you're dealing with people who need to hear that

181
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
It can also be very advantageous

182
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
It to get a different type of response

183
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
As I think Michael was pointing out by

184
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,800
You know showing up with a good quality perhaps, but maybe more like a mr. microphone type deal

185
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,320
You're gonna get someone will you probably able to catch unawares you know and say things that you wouldn't expect him to say normally

186
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,680
Right that was part of my idea behind creating

187
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,720
KSS X I mean I have a small studio built boutique studio of that kind of is responsible for doing you know anything that I

188
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,240
Essentially do is just okay if it needs to be more professional sounding I have a studio name on it

189
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,080
And I found KSS X kind of my accident because I have a lot of friends that do traditional pirate radio

190
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,720
And I have had friends that are you know on the air that work for clear channel and so I love that podcast and kind of puts everything in the middle

191
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,080
You know it's a little bit better

192
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,840
Than pirate, but it's also you know a little bit more real than what you might hear you know that wacky morning, too

193
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,040
Kind of think you mean everybody get bored of this the crazy morning

194
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,240
All right event lab podcasting challenges the title of that show do check it out

195
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,720
And I show also put that in this new feed that I'm gonna tell you about in a couple of minutes

196
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Let me see where was I here

197
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,840
What's all that racket oh man what they're doing outside

198
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,440
So I still don't by the way haven't seen anyone actually connect the wires now that the pipe is

199
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,160
Has been tunneled through the garden up to the house

200
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,040
And you know today I'll hook up that router and see if the the big mega line is working

201
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,080
I thought it was those guys for second outside, but no, it's definitely the gardener

202
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,120
Yes, they were talking about the OPML

203
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,760
That's a part of the I potted out org directory that people are using for the applications and other directories

204
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,600
And I've got an email from calum who says that there is

205
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,960
A great essay that Joel Spolsky wrote about double byte encoding it's titled the absolute minimum every software developer

206
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,080
Absolutely positively must know about unicode and character sets no excuses

207
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,680
Now calum sets it's very readable explain the subject to him more clearly than anything else you'd ever come across

208
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,080
And I have started to read that and yes, I'm starting to understand that

209
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
It's not trivial stuff

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's not trivial, but give that a read

211
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,560
It will explain some of the issues that we're that we're running into although really I found that

212
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,520
You know there's this OPML stuff, which is great because OPML is really it's a four hey on

213
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Is it the gardeners?

214
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
I thought they came on Thursdays

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah, so we can clean up the poop the dog shit

216
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
He closed the door from me, huh?

217
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,080
Thanks

218
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
It gives me much better acoustics in the studio

219
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,560
Okay back to the pod squad or the OPMLs what I was talking about so I use an outline I use

220
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,480
The outline of your find in radio user land or frontier and I use it for almost everything I got it

221
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,000
Got to tell you it's great. I'm my brain works well without liners

222
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,080
So when you save an outline document, that's what the format is it's OPML outline processor markup language which is

223
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,160
XML essentially and this is adopted far and wide particularly for subscriptions

224
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,840
But when it's an RSS subscriptions reading list if you will as an OPML file

225
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,240
These are the types of files that you'll see almost every single aggregator and I believe

226
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,200
Most of the podcasts though I iPodders

227
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Also are able to subscribe

228
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,680
Through OPML files now the file that I've currently if you ever seen this the pod squad there's there's links to it

229
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,640
I did it a little differently

230
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
But I think that's kind of confused everything in everybody including me

231
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,880
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to create a new pod squad

232
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,960
OPML file

233
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,600
Excuse me, which will include like you know the 12 or what 10 or 15

234
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,920
Podcast that I listen to so it's you know it's a personal thing obviously, but

235
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,560
It's people that you know we've been working with and pod casting for for a while

236
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,800
No, I think it's great and you know it's it's my my personal pod squad, right?

237
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,080
It's whatever I think belongs on that list. I'm going to make it into a traditional OPML file

238
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
so that

239
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:43,120
You can actually just download this file drag and drop it into your iPodder and it will subscribe to all of those

240
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Feed so I'm not going to make it too big obviously

241
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,480
There's something else for the iPodder

242
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,040
Guys to think about you know if I deliver an OPML file that someone wants to subscribe to and you just by dragging it in

243
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,280
Perhaps we should have an automatic only get the first pod cast from each feed setting or something like that

244
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,680
So we don't swamp people with you know hundreds of megs just from one single

245
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Swoop of the mouse to subscribe

246
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,000
Additionally in the iPodder.org OPML of the directory. I'm going to put

247
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,360
The same pod squad file in there only it won't be RSS links. It'll just be linked to the RSS files. I think

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh

249
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,560
This is a call actually I want to take hold on cool. I put you on pause again. I'm getting pretty good at that

250
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,600
You didn't want to hear that call. I did but you didn't show

251
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:49,200
Back to pod squad right so I'm going to put a pod squad node into the iPodder.org OPML

252
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,200
Which will be the same as all of the other

253
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,400
iPodder.org directory nodes so that you can actually auto you know subscribe to that to each individual feed

254
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,720
From your iPodder software. I think I've gotten all the buggies out now

255
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
so that

256
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,080
So that it's not breaking the directory browsers in the in the iPodder software

257
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,400
So you should be able to then just you know click and subscribe to those then of course

258
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
I want an HTML version

259
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,960
So you can sample sample those and I guess

260
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,720
Maybe maybe there should be one feed for the pod squad so you just that's actually an interesting idea

261
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,840
I don't know if that's the right way to do it

262
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,160
What yeah, let me know what you think about that if I gave you one feed for the pod squad and

263
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,000
Essentially whenever a new show comes out from any of the pod squad podcast you automatically receive that

264
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,280
I don't know if that's a good idea. I guess it's the same thing if I guess that has more power if you

265
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Subscribe to all of them because then if you don't like something you can unsubscribe. Yeah, that makes more sense

266
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,240
I guess okay, so anyway I'm working on that really been thinking a lot about cleaning up

267
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
pointers and stuff

268
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Getting the show knows working a lot better

269
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,480
You know just so we can I just got to keep my head straight and you know be able to see everything also another

270
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
little test that I did

271
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,040
I

272
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,320
Started a podcast feed which I pointed to yesterday from my weblog grade calm

273
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
For sound seeing tours and

274
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:32,720
This is my first attempt at a feed burner feed and I got to say they've got some pretty interesting shit going on

275
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,440
The most exciting I guess is that you can actually look at statistics and see

276
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,080
I'll pull up the statistics right now so I released this yesterday

277
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,760
And it's essentially no more than a

278
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,640
An RSS feed that you can subscribe to and whenever I come across a great sound seeing tour

279
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm going to plug that into the RSS feed so it'll auto download to your

280
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,440
To your PC or to your iPod or your MP3 player

281
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,400
On the stats side if got some you know, it's good. It's exactly what you want to see as a as a programmer

282
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,160
I mean as an audio programmer someone who's you know wants to know what what you know how many people are subscribed

283
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,240
What they're using so I'm looking here at these stats

284
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Pretty interesting

285
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
So they have something they call circulation

286
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,120
And circulation is their attempt at saying well, okay, these are the actual number of subscribers

287
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,600
They also give you hits how many times how many times the feed has been hit, but so since yesterday

288
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,280
I have a 446 subscribers to the sound seeing

289
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,440
Tour what's interesting though is this pie chart that tells you what type of iPoders or

290
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,480
Aggregators or what they call here readers are actually subscribed to your feed

291
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
So check this out for some stats

292
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:02,080
Interesting to see that fire fox the live bookmark so that's the RSS functionality that fire fox has bundled in with their with their browser

293
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
accounts for 22.4%

294
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,280
iPoder is

295
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
18

296
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:19,040
Percent that's I presume the lemon version. Yeah because iPoderex is 3.7% that's about right for the mac market

297
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,840
Thunderbird 2.0 8.1% so I guess that's just a regular browser

298
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Excuse me 8.9% is unidentified

299
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,120
net news wire 13.4% and other readers account for 25% so

300
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
From a browser perspective

301
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
fire fox

302
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
is

303
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
higher ranked

304
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,280
Then internet explorer wouldn't have expected that really

305
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,960
And of the readers and agregators

306
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,600
Fire fox live bookmarks is the top followed by iPoder followed by net news wire

307
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,600
Follow by all the unidentified followed by Thunderbird iPoderex

308
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,080
And then it goes down to oh this and more here feed reader universal feed parser intro v news

309
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,560
CFN network this is cool. I got to check these out these like all iPodd

310
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,480
Variants my god there's a whole list blog matrix yager feed demon news gator

311
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
nimic pluck sharp reader

312
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Someone's actually using curl

313
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Which is a command line

314
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,480
HTP glide I guess on the mac i Potter v a j Potter. I'm sorry j Potter v cool. That's a 2.0

315
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,240
No, oh dot 8.0 a wasu what the hell is a wasu?

316
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,320
A wasu is a free windows news reader that runs in the background on your computer. Okay blog lines kinger

317
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
A kinger has a little

318
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,200
exclamation mark next to it, which is interesting kinger says

319
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,840
So web based blog aggregator, but kinger does not currently report the number of kinger subscribers to your feed when it

320
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,040
Request the feed meaning I guess that others do

321
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,200
But I see my yahoo is way down on the list so I guess they're not reporting either or just no one subscribe through my yahoo

322
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
I'm gonna keep my eyes on this see if I can pick up any trends

323
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,760
It's definitely cool to have the you know some more expanded stats than then what I'm normally used to which is basically just an access number so

324
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Cool stuff and

325
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Give that feed a try

326
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,000
You know whenever I come across something they have a little bookmarklet

327
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:38,240
If I see an MP3 or I'm listening to an MP3 that I like I just click the bookmarklet and it brings up the

328
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,560
The feed details. I just have to add a name and a title and it goes right in

329
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,600
So yeah good stuff now. I know why so many people are using feed burner and it does really allow you to

330
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,320
You know add enclosures to your feed that normally you might have if you're using a web blog system that doesn't support that so

331
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Let's talk about class

332
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Class blaster for a second. This is

333
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,520
Was it was it Sunday or was it yesterday only that I was talking about you know wanting something very simple

334
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,880
Well, I can just you know have a folder on my desktop drop a file into it and have that automatically be part of an RSS feed and

335
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,280
I got tons of email all kinds of pointers and ideas and scripts and you know

336
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,160
Everyone has has thought of this

337
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,680
I am certainly not you you can coming up with this idea

338
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
But none of them really

339
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,360
Would work or at least wouldn't work for me. I could not get them to work

340
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,680
It seems that if you want to use Pearl the Mac has a very

341
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Typical Pearl installation

342
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:51,440
Now anyway Craig Meyer hook me up big time he created a special install of the podcastmatic that I can Bradley wrote

343
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Did I play the promo for yesterday?

344
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,160
Basically setting it up so that it works in you know the default Mac and Tosh install whatever it is

345
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,200
That was really cool that he did that for me and this is great

346
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,600
So here's here's the way I have it set up

347
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
I set up a

348
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,320
Separate directory on my dot mac account so I basically just drop a file in there drop an MP3 in there

349
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
It uploads and

350
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,040
I still have one manual step that I do right now, but I'm gonna make that automatic

351
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,440
You know then I just run this one command and basically what it does is it goes in it

352
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,240
checks out how long the file is it parses the ID three tags and then creates an HTML file as well as a

353
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,320
An RSS file which to me looks validated perfectly

354
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
So it works

355
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,440
You know it's

356
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,560
The system is there all I need to do now of course is just make the the magic folder that I that I like so much

357
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,000
So I drop it in and from there copies it over seamlessly and once it's copied over it then

358
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,120
Triggers the the update the feed command so that'll be my a little project for this afternoon

359
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,720
But this is good. This is really starting to get somewhere. This is the type of podcast functionality

360
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,680
I think that we need to make for the masses because it's so fucking simple it's like an inbox and outbox

361
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:16,400
You know just drag this into the outbox all you have to do all you have to know is how to fill out the ID three tags

362
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,680
You can do that in iTunes on the Mac or Windows and there's a whole slew of programs that will let you create those

363
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,040
So essentially once you've set up your configuration file, which of course no one in the right mind really wants to do

364
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,760
But let's say that your your file is configured so that your feed reads what it should read

365
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,800
You know in this case I've called up my test cast blaster feed or whatever

366
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,360
Everything else is automatic all you have to do is fill out as much information as possible in the ID three tags

367
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,040
And you're good to go. So I will be experimenting with that and of course. I'll have the feed to the cast blaster feed

368
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,680
I have like three MP3s in there now. It's just going to be stuff that I think you should listen to

369
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
it's

370
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,280
Stuff that I may have exerved in the source code, but can't play the whole thing so for instance

371
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,400
What I just played for you that that bit from

372
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,400
The podcasting challenges with Michael Gohagan that's in there

373
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,920
So check out the the show notes for today's podcast and you'll be able to subscribe to that feed let me know

374
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,720
You know what you think and if anyone else is working on more of these

375
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,480
Simple dragon drop creator podcast systems

376
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,200
Let me know you know this is this is cool stuff and this is the way to get more people

377
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Indepod casting which you know and of course I was just thinking not only here's his a feature that should add of course

378
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
It should ping audio.weblogs.com

379
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,280
Once it's updated the RSS file so many different things to think of

380
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,840
And of course thank you all very much for pointing out to me. Yes, they have to have played the mix of the the biddies with you

381
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Don't owe me

382
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
With that was the mix

383
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,800
That young pollette did in in Holland the mix with the Dutch singer on the rehauses

384
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,440
I of course knew that it was a cover version and I

385
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,920
Not only did I know this because I'm a disc jockey and have all the Lawrence welka albums

386
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,920
Also, it was reiterated on cover bill to show that the biddies were on recently

387
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,920
So I don't know if if you knew that if he was just like surprised or thought that there was some plagiarism going on

388
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,560
But a lot of people were really friendly enough to send me the original which you'll be probably remember as this one done by

389
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Leslie Gordon

390
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,800
Here's you don't only on the daily source code

391
00:29:45,920 --> 00:30:00,880
I

392
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,560
Oh

393
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,360
You

394
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,840
r

395
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:31,920
I don't tell you what to say I don't tell you what to do

396
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:47,920
So just let me be myself That's all I have to do I don't care, I love you, I'm free, yeah, I love you to be free

397
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:55,920
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

398
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Now I know who I'm doing the best, I love you

399
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:47,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

400
00:31:47,920 --> 00:32:17,920
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

401
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:26,720
lives in Amsterdam, and he did a walking tour of the Albert Cup market in Amsterdam.

402
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,920
It's really funny because of course I can understand everything that's going on

403
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,000
on the background. You should see his setup, he's using, I guess it's I think it's a

404
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,800
Bluetooth wireless headset and it looks just like, you know, he would be talking

405
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,800
on the telephone, he's walking through Amsterdam, but besides it being an excellent

406
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,440
sound-seeing tour and of course you'll find it in the show notes for today and in that new

407
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:55,360
sound-seeing tour podcast feed. He also, he did something really, really cool. Let me see if I

408
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,960
can, I'll fire it up, let's do the beginning of it and he explains how, you know, it's basically

409
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,200
it's more than just a sound-seeing tour, why it's a multimedia tour. The bicycle mark audio

410
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:15,360
I'm sorry it's a commuter K actually, it's what I meant. So it is Saturday, January 22nd, 2005,

411
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,440
and I'm bringing you our first sound-seeing tour in Amsterdam, and one more thing before I go,

412
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,240
thank you to no coins for leaving me a little tip in the tip jar, funding the podcasts for a

413
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,440
couple of more months, and here we go. Okay, check this out.

414
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,920
All right, good morning from Amsterdam, or whatever, good evening, wherever you are,

415
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,320
it's morning here, about midday, and I'm in the pipe neighborhood of Amsterdam. Of course you'd

416
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,680
be in the pipe neighborhood, it's my favorite neighborhood, which would be in the south, just behind

417
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,240
the Heinrich and Brewery, which you may know and love so well. Okay, so you didn't know it,

418
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,200
this is, yeah, like the sweeper says, the bicycle mark audio communique, and today I'm going

419
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,240
to take a sound-seeing tour of the Albert Kite market, where basically I intend to

420
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,680
describe everything to you in words, maybe describe the smells, the feels, and I hope the sounds

421
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:18,000
will just come across pretty well. Just listening to him talk about it, I can already feel the

422
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,040
fresh air and all our stuff and shit go away. I'm busy, please, can't you turn on podcasting?

423
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,520
Here for yourself. A lot of people running around, so a lot of people are going to be looking at

424
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,280
me when they're going to what I'm doing, but it's Amsterdam, so we don't, we don't tend to really

425
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,040
give a shit. Also, I brought my digital cam along, just to be taking photos, which you can

426
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:47,920
follow along in my flicker photo show. How cool is this? And he does this really high-tech thing

427
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:54,400
in a really old school way. Check it out. And what I'll do is I'll play the law in order

428
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,840
sound, and that means change pictures. And so that reminds me of, when I was a kid in school,

429
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,600
you know, and you'll be listening to some audio tape, and you have a workbook that goes

430
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,240
along with it, and you hear the, and that means you had to turn the page. In fact, I think it was,

431
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,040
maybe that was with the Bonsio-Line Bonsio-Missio-Lip Professor,

432
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,840
turn the page. Anyway, you got to check it out, some great photos. He actually forgot to

433
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:30,880
continue to take pictures about halfway through, but totally new way of listening to a sound

434
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,600
scene tour. It works perfectly well without the pictures, by the way. But it's, I did it with

435
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,640
the pictures. I didn't, you know, skip ahead, although, unfortunately, in the flicker slide show,

436
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,200
it already shows you what the next frame is going to be in a little mini previews. That kind of,

437
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,240
yeah, that kind of ruins it a little bit. But awesome. Awesome. Looking forward to many more

438
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:58,800
communicates from our buddy bicycle mark. You'll like this. It's like an MTV slamer. The

439
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,920
ballot of Carson Daily. This is Master Pierce Weirder. Tony Goldmark brings it to you.

440
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,640
Here's the tale of a cowboy. I'm sure we all recall. We all know about his rise,

441
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,160
and we know about his fall. He was raised in Santa Monica, but he moved old and why,

442
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,960
where he'd host the daily countdown. The time squares through the owes so high.

443
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,880
Carson Daily. He was close up to your nail Carson Daily. He heard the man's all screaming

444
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,320
Yale. He didn't introduce his attendant videos from the time first studios and soon into

445
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:45,680
obscurity. He failed. Just like in a tea and Martha Quinn and other names at Bailey Carson Daily.

446
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,440
Every day and three on MTV, it's see him on the tube. When his head awful,

447
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,880
a hairspray just a smile and lack of food. Playing videos by boy bands and going to bleed up the

448
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:08,480
wise doing if you wanted steady paycheck. He had to pretend he liked him too. He would interview

449
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,880
celebrities and play their world for me or playing everyone from antsink all the way to Britney Spears.

450
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,920
He would make a lot of votes no longer want their MTV by making intellectual observations written by

451
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:32,320
next angle child of three. Carson Daily. He was close up to your nail Carson Daily. He heard

452
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,880
bands all screaming Yale. He introduced his attendant videos from the time first studios and soon into

453
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:46,240
obscurity. He failed. Just like Julie Brown and Jesse Camp and other names at Bailey Carson Daily.

454
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:55,680
But his fame was very short. About a year 2005, he assumed that he could get most any woman

455
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,080
dead or alive. And so after a failed marriage to actress Tauri, he got caught up into what

456
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:11,840
Kales Ever Cowboy. Here on a screen. Yeah, pretty soon. His rhyming star came plummeting to Earth.

457
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,720
Now he's worth less than eight Italian Lera. It happened one day when he wasn't at the studio.

458
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:27,040
And they realized he was late. They finally found him in the suit. He ordering his birth

459
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,640
in a closet with Christina Acculara. And they locked him up in prison on the charge of violating

460
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:43,600
jail bakes. So he spent the next five years in Santa Pino Institution every morning in the

461
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:50,320
showers. He received his retribution and meanwhile TRL was taken over by Tom Green. And since

462
00:38:50,320 --> 00:39:00,640
then Hollywood squares his own the place Carson hasn't seen Carson Daily was close up to

463
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,840
Carson Daily. He heard the fans all screaming jail. He introduced his top 10 videos from the

464
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:15,360
time for studios and soon into obscurity. He failed. Just like Kennedy and Martha Quinn and other

465
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:23,440
names at family Carson Daily. He was the host of TRL, Carson Daily. He heard the fans all screaming

466
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,080
jail. He introduced his top 10 videos from the time for studios and soon into obscurity.

467
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,880
Too bad it kind of fades out. It's like a cop-out should have ended that song.

468
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,320
The ballad of Carson Daily just want to say a couple things about that. First of all it's funny.

469
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:48,320
You know it makes me chuckle but it's really not fair. Carson actually had that job. I did before

470
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:57,840
it was TRL total request live. It was MTV's most wanted and before that it was dial MTV.

471
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,640
And the same format. You know you call you vote you vote through the by the phone lines

472
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,920
that used to be free by the way when I was still there. It was free free call or just like a regular

473
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,920
toll call. And now of course I'm sure you pay money for that for voting and you know well

474
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,960
rightly so but that's how much has changed. So I had that job and you know when you leave MTV

475
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,560
and I'm not quite sure why he left or if he's even gone I guess I guess he's gone.

476
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,680
I don't know him personally. Although he probably still works with the exact same camera

477
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,760
people that I used to work with. A lot of people are they have been there for 20 years at least.

478
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,560
It's been 10 years since I've been there. But you know people are it's hard when you leave

479
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,200
a gig like that you know MTV it's like you're you're so fucking pigeonholed you know if you think

480
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,840
it's a springboard to anything oh that's just not certainly not in show business. I mean MTV

481
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:57,920
is weighed down on the ladder and of course you make no money and that's very relative. I mean

482
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,240
of course you make money you make good money by all standards you're in the richest one

483
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:10,720
percent of the world. But it's not like showbiz crazy Hollywood fucking money no way no no no no.

484
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:20,000
I see when I was at MTV until what I made I made the first year $150 and the second year

485
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,440
$175,000. Great money don't get me wrong don't send me feedback that you know I'm fucked up for

486
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,720
sake but it's not the 10 million you know Tom Cruise gets for a movie of course it doesn't

487
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,000
require the same type of talent either. But it's the best money you're ever going to make as you

488
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
know as a VJ because from there I don't think you really can go no one's really been successful

489
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,880
at moving further in show business and what I'll do this is a good idea I'm going to get Ken

490
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,960
Clark on a Skype call Ken was the talent coordinator he does a podcast with Cindy who who I also

491
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,840
worked with it's the Ken and Squip show and I'll get Ken on the honker and we should just have a

492
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,240
chat and let's just run down the list and let's see what everyone's done because he keeps in contact

493
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,760
or knows pretty much what everyone is doing and they're actually doing some interesting things so

494
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,520
that's a promise for a future maybe we'll do that tomorrow he's I think he's on tour now or whatever

495
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,280
but maybe when he gets back home or when we can work out the time differences between West Coast

496
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,280
and London we'll hook that up. One more mention before I go remember Craig Patchett's daughter who

497
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,120
read the Bible verse couple months ago I had it on the playdown the source code

498
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,160
she is now doing her own podcast which probably makes her the youngest podcast or eight years old

499
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:53,520
which actually Rick from ICM Ross and me the Zemois says that beats out Matthew Bishop by six years

500
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,680
so there's a link to her show at it's a part of the godcast category and the godcast network

501
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,360
actually and you can find that at godcast.org of course through ipod.org in the directory

502
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,800
that's it for the show 43 minutes little longer than normal actually I think I've been running

503
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,640
consistently over 40 minutes so I think got to keep a tight I'll be back tomorrow it's going to be a

504
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,720
real busy day not quite sure what time I'll have a show up for you gonna try and get it up in the

505
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,600
morning hours for me which means it'll be ready for everyone's state side even before you go

506
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,800
or in the comments add them at correct calm if you're going to send me an MP3 file send it to

507
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:47,040
MP3 feedback at gmail.com all the episodes of the source code and the podcast feeds subscriber

508
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,880

509
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,040
replay if you need to hear it again I'm out I'll see you tomorrow right here on the source code
