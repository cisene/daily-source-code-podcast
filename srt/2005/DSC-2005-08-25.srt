1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta's year at Charlie 228.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Quick and time!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
DJ, are you done?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Do you know what?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We don't need no sticky grip.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Fantastic!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's August 25, 2005.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's the Daily Source Code.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And good afternoon everybody.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How are you doing?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thursday.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We've done a show every single day.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This week, it truly is the Daily Source Code.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm amazed.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm just amazed.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It is about 4.35 in the afternoon.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Coming to you directly from Curry Cottage.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's the Daily Source Code.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And this is the first official show in the podcast complex.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's right.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This morning Mark and I think Stewart is his name.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
His accomplice, his assistant came on over.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And we removed the home build podcast complex

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
from the garage, moved it all the way up to the bedroom studio.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I spent most of the morning reconnecting, reconfiguring,

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
re-adjusting and taking pictures of my handy work.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It is absolutely phenomenally beautiful.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And it works.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's so functional.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's ergonomic.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's systematic.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's been kind of a weird day today.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It started off reasonably nice,

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
but wet.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And it just went really ugly.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And now it's like, look out the window.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A lot of wind.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But sunshine.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Alrighty.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We have quite, I always say that, don't right?

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We have a lot to talk about.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But it really is true.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I got to cram all this into 30 or 40 minutes.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I've got a couple minutes.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm going to see how long is this piece of the Zedcast.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm going to be check.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What is it?

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Three minutes and fifty.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Six seconds of the Zedcast.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's in counters, pod save music from Matthew Ebel.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And plenty of promos.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And we're talking about some geek stuff like GPS, GPS files.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And have a mashup for you.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
See, where did I pull this one off of?

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think this was something that Peter Fadden put on the series show.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's toxic shack.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Gelat on the source code.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
See, you've paid it tight.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can sign as a vote.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's it.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's it.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's it.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's it.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's it.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's it.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's it.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's it.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's it.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's it.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's it.

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's it.

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's it.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's it.

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's it.

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's it.

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's it.

81
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's it.

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's it.

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's it.

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's it.

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's it.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's it.

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's it.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's it.

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's it.

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's it.

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's it.

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's it.

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's it.

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Love, shine, there's a little place where you can get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,100
get to get to get to get done it's that one

96
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,240
run

97
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,420
In

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:20,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Shut up, fuck it up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up,

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:20,000
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut off, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up,

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Jack happened in here, finally everything's all put together,

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,960
and I could not be happier with the way things have turned out.

104
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,320
Still kind of tweaking the sound a little bit.

105
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,720
And actually, I knew the sound was good enough

106
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
to use for today's source code,

107
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
because I've been testing back and forth with PW Fenton,

108
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,280
of Digital Flotsom, he produces the serious shows,

109
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,640
and we work a lot on sound stuff together.

110
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,400
And he sent me an email, he said,

111
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,240
oh man, it's sounding great now.

112
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
So that's good enough, because he uses a silo scopes

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,760
and stuff to check frequency ranges.

114
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,760
But I like to drive, drive everything really loud,

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,160
compressors and allimitors,

116
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,240
and chaining those together to achieve a certain kind of sound.

117
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,200
And I think I've got it.

118
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,640
So anyway, so finally the podcast complex is complete.

119
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,280
It's upstairs in the bedroom studio,

120
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,280
and I've got the Yamaha Professional Audio Workstation AW16G

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,280
right in the front, I've got my power book, my G4 power book

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,200
over on the right, and then on the upper shelf,

123
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,280
on the left, I've got the stereo valve processor,

124
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,720
on the right now, I've put the crap-lit,

125
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
which is, and it wasn't planned that way,

126
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,040
but it turns out perfectly,

127
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,440
because I can put the crap-lit up on this top shelf,

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
swivel the screen, because of course,

129
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,760
it normally, the screen can turn around

130
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,280
and fold over into a tablet.

131
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,400
So now I can actually read stuff off of that screen,

132
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,960
and I said, I level, and I don't have to use the Macintosh,

133
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,640
because it's conveniently located down on the right-hand lower side.

134
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,560
So it's just perfect, and I love standing up while I'm working.

135
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,520
I really do, and maybe I'll improve my posture

136
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,960
even one of these days.

137
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,920
So we're still tweaking the little bits here,

138
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,160
but I'm really, really happy with how it's working out so far.

139
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,280
Okay, what was I gonna talk to you about?

140
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Oh, it looks like I'm not gonna go back to San Francisco.

141
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,040
Just yeah, it'll probably be,

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,560
we're gonna go to New York first,

143
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,120
then to Chicago, lots of advertising agencies

144
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,400
to talk to, lots of people are very interested.

145
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm gonna do some interviews while we're in New York.

146
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,560
Got some of the phoneers tomorrow, actually.

147
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Financial times, and parade magazine,

148
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,120
but I found, parade magazine is huge, by the way.

149
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,920
It's like one of the biggest magazines in the United States,

150
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,280
so, extremely excited about that.

151
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,760
Then we'll go to San Francisco,

152
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,560
and hopefully Patricia really got a lot of stuff together

153
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,840
for the Curry Condo in San Fran.

154
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,160
But we're still waiting for an order from JC Penny,

155
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,040
and we ordered that when we were in New York,

156
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
because that's like almost two weeks ago,

157
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,120
and I knew that one item had to transfer from another warehouse.

158
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,080
So I knew that it could last more than one business week,

159
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,720
but then I didn't hear anything for another week,

160
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
and then finally, an email shows up,

161
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
and there's no like, sorry, we're late,

162
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,000
or your order is ready to ship, or any pleasant news.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,600
It was just to make sure that there's no fault

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,880
with your credit card, provide us with the billing details.

165
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
I'm like, what the fuck, you know?

166
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,520
I don't know, what's wrong with JC Penny?

167
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,760
I mean, they used to be really good with online ordering,

168
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,960
and now this.

169
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,440
That's just American credit cards in general.

170
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,960
There's, I don't know, it's whenever I use a European card,

171
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,400
talked about this before, it's never a problem.

172
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,480
The credit card company or bank never wants to double check anything,

173
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,200
and there's also no fraud ever on those.

174
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,560
Oh, knock on wood, which, of course, is exactly

175
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,400
what the podcast complex is made of.

176
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,760
Kids don't touch that time,

177
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
because now it's time for the Bobby Bucket Show.

178
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Hello readers, it's Bobby Bucket with the Bobby Bucket Show,

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
a podcast for kids, parents, and readers of all ages.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
If you love reading, then you're gonna love our show

181
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,560
because each week, we explore the best in children

182
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,480
in young readers' literature,

183
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,200
and we have a special section just for parents

184
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,800
to support their child's reading.

185
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
And we talk about things good readers do

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
in a fun and educational way.

187
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,960
And here for a sneak peek is my good friend,

188
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,440
Madam literatus, talking about the reading strategy

189
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,000
of making predictions.

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hello, it is Madam literatus.

191
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,680
Every so often read a stop and make predictions

192
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,880
or guesses about what is called

193
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,400
happen next in the story, they do this by using

194
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,240
both pictures and text and even connections

195
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,880
made by personal experience or text to text connections

196
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,560
or text to word connections.

197
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,320
You see good readers do not just see back in past

198
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,200
every way for me to come to them.

199
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,640
No, as they read their custody making meaning

200
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,280
by making predictions readers are playing around

201
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,080
with that meaning readers make those predictions

202
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,000
they read a little more and then they find out

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
if their predictions were correct or not,

204
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,160
if they weren't, they could sell them.

205
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,360
And they make new predictions.

206
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,480
So by making predictions, you're doing the following

207
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,440
with your mind.

208
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,280
You are connecting prior knowledge and experience,

209
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,480
focusing about the actual words in the story

210
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,240
and trying to figure out things by filling in gaps

211
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,320
in the author's writing.

212
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,120
Kind of like you are reading between the lines

213
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,120
or trying to read the writers' thoughts instead of just her words.

214
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,320
For the body bucket show, this is Madam literatus.

215
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:21,320

236
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
That's so cool.

237
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,880
So, you know, and then I hear these promos

238
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
I select them from a whole bunch of, well, I've got like,

239
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
PW and I have kind of like a system work to work out.

240
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
And then I hear them on the show and like, you know,

241
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
that sounds like a good show.

242
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
I want to subscribe to that.

243
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
It really does work.

00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880

247
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Okay.

248
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Please.

249
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
And don't name it promo.

250
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Dot MP3.

251
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Um,

252
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,880
if for the serious show on serious satellite radio,

253
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
every day we do four hours of podcasts

254
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880
and podsafe music and mashups.

255
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
But put out and promos, of course.

256
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,880
But always, at least one featured podcast an hour.

257
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,880
And you can send all those, you know,

258
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
if you wanted to be played on serious,

259
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
send it off to submit at podshow.com.

260
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
PWFend and does a lot of the sifting,

261
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
well, does all the sifting through that, basically.

262
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Um, and is always listening to new stuff coming out.

263
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
And so once in a while,

264
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
I'll stumble across something,

265
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
which, of course, I'll put on the podshow

266
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
and then, and then he'll alert me to it.

267
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Because of course, I'm going to announce it.

268
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,880
And so I'll listen to this podcast before I even talk about it on the show.

269
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,880
And there's this podcast called The Zedcast.

270
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
This is episode number seven of The Zedcast.

271
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,880
And it's titled Close Encounters.

272
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,880
So, you know, Close Encounters with the third kind.

273
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
And there's a whole set up to it,

274
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
which I'm not going to play.

275
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm going to play the part though,

276
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
when the aliens land.

277
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Because, well, I'm not going to tell you why,

278
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,880
but it's, uh, it did have me laughing for sure.

279
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Whoa!

280
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Ladies and gentlemen, the sky is just turned up really a chain of fusion.

281
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
A giant mother ship.

282
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
He's coming out of the clouds.

283
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
It's enormous.

284
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,880
There are hatches opening on the bottom of the ship.

285
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,880
And there's pod-like crafts shooting everywhere.

286
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
It's unbelievable.

287
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Please, gentlemen, I think we've made contact.

288
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
One of the pods is slanting right in front of us.

289
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,880
There's a door on the front that's opening.

290
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,880
And, oh, there's a beautiful bathing light.

291
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
And, and a beam.

292
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,880
So much humanoid, but it seems to be floating above the ground.

293
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,880
And, and behind him, several dozen just like him.

294
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
They seem pretty enough.

295
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to attempt to get close enough

296
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
to these beings to try and communicate with them.

297
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Hello.

298
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Welcome to Canada.

299
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
We are people of Earth.

300
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
We mean you no harm.

301
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Oh, I don't know if they could understand me.

302
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
People of Earth.

303
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,880
We have intercepted your transmissions.

304
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,880
We have analyzed your dialects.

305
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,880
And can speak to you in your own language.

306
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
How's it going, eh?

307
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
Good.

308
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,880
You said you intercepted transmissions.

309
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Was that from our radio telescopes?

310
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
No.

311
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
We do not listen to the radio.

312
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Was it television transmissions?

313
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
No.

314
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Television is boring.

315
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
There's never anything good on me.

316
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Uh, what kind of transmissions?

317
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
We have been tuning into your hottest sphere.

318
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Oh, we are listening to podcasts.

319
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
That's great.

320
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,880
We are from the planet Zed.

321
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,880
And we have been transmitting our Zedcast to you for many months.

322
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Oh, yeah, the Zedcast with Bruce Murray, right?

323
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Yeah, but that's like comedy skits.

324
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,880
And he does storytelling and play some music.

325
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Yes, you must decode it.

326
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,880
If you play it normally, it sounds like this.

327
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Hi, everybody.

328
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
And welcome to the Zedcast.

329
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
But run it backwards.

330
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
And it is people of Earth.

331
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
We need our warning.

332
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Well, why have you come to this planet?

333
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,880
We come to speak to the one called Adam.

334
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Adam and Eve.

335
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Adam and Eve.

336
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
No, later than that.

337
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Adam and Goyan.

338
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Keep going.

339
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Uh, Brian Adams.

340
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Okay, this is getting annoying.

341
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
I will give you a hand.

342
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Today, are you guys amazing?

343
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Yeah.

344
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Oh, Adam Curry from Podcho.

345
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Yes, that is him.

346
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,880
We need his daily source code to program our events from

347
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Unications.

348
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Please direct us to Curry Cottage.

349
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Oh, well, uh, this is Nova Scotia in Canada.

350
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Uh, he lives in Guilford in the UK.

351
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,880
That's like 1,500 kilometers across the Atlantic Ocean.

352
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
No problem.

353
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
We will be there in 20 seconds.

354
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
20 seconds.

355
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
That's amazing.

356
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
How do you do that?

357
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,880
I have 16 million keypaps of spacecrafts throughout my ass.

358
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,880
And the next generation of interstellar communications in my ears.

359
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,880
So I guess you're flying into the future.

360
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
No.

361
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
I've been there.

362
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
It's not all that's cracked up to me.

363
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Well, good luck on your journey.

364
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Thanks for visiting.

365
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
No problem.

366
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Stay subscribed.

367
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Okay.

368
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Set a love home fries.

369
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Wow.

370
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
What was that?

371
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
You're your photon engine starting up?

372
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
No.

373
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
That's insane.

374
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Oh, man.

375
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I love it.

376
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
That's a great episode.

377
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
The Zedcast.

378
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
And if you want to know where to find the Zedcast.

379
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Or anything else about anything you hear on the daily source code.

380
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Just go to dailysourcecode.com.

381
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Check the show notes.

382
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Or the show.

383
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,880
The show notes are also always copied at www.curry.com.

384
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
That's also where I post the picture of the podcast complex.

385
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
So you can check that out as well.

386
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
And let's see.

387
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Before I forget yesterday, pod save music.

388
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
I played Jennifer Halane.

389
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,880
And that's what's so cool about playing pod save music on a podcast.

390
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Usually, I'll get an email the same day from the artist themselves saying,

391
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Hey, thanks for playing the song.

392
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,880
And you know, always get to get to know a little bit more about him.

393
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,880
And it was actually Jennifer's brother who signed her up at pod save music network.com.

394
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,880
She'd heard about garageband.com.

395
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,880
But didn't know about PMN yet.

396
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,880
And this is actually something that's really true.

397
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
But most musicians, and not Jennifer, by the way.

398
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Most musicians are just so lazy.

399
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,880
They don't want to go out and promote across all these websites.

400
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Now, so they're probably writing songs and too busy with doing music.

401
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,880
So this is what you see happening a lot.

402
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Barry Coral's brother also promotes her on the net.

403
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,880
So Jennifer wanted me to say hi to her brother.

404
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,880
And point out that he also has a podcast at frankwit.com.

405
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,880
So I'll put that in the show notes as well.

406
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,880
And I've been geeking out on this GPS stuff with the GPX files.

407
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,880
So, you know, I've been basically tracking my my flying.

408
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
And you can load those files into Google Earth.

409
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
And you can actually fly the entire route.

410
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
And there's also not quite sure how to do it.

411
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,880
But if you go to jeepster.com, that's G-E-E-P-S-T-E-R

412
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,880
or Gulf-Eko-Eko-Papa-Shere-Tango-Eko-Romio.com,

413
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,880
that's Koso's, one of Koso's many websites.

414
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,880
He's loaded both the most recent track,

415
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
where I flew to the Netherlands and back.

416
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
He loaded that into a Google map.

417
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,880
And he also did one for my USA trip.

418
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
And it's cool.

419
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,880
You can actually see the entire flight path that we took.

420
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,880
I really liked the one that we did on,

421
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
we went to Rotterdam Airport.

422
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
And then to mid-Azailum.

423
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Because you can actually see the touch-and-go circuits that we were flying.

424
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
And they're almost all exactly the same.

425
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
It's really cool.

426
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
And although at Rotterdam Airport,

427
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,880
at the jet center, we parked to drop Patricia's parents off.

428
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
And we waited for, I don't know,

429
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
we had a couple of coffee or something before we left.

430
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
You'll see the track if you,

431
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,880
and I'll put links to all this in the show notes.

432
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,880
You'll see it looks like we were bugging all over the place.

433
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,880
But I think what happened is I just left the GPS unit on.

434
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,880
So it was recording every 15 or 30 seconds, I think.

435
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,880
And as I mentioned, it was IFR weather.

436
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
So the ceiling was like 300, 400 feet.

437
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
It was completely blocked out.

438
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,880
So I have a feeling that the GPS unit couldn't get

439
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,880
more than a couple of satellites.

440
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,880
And it was just every 15 seconds picking up a new signal.

441
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,880
And that's probably the inaccuracy,

442
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
if you're not a moving object, if you're just standing still.

443
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,880
And then, of course, it amazes me how those smart bombs hit their mark.

444
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Anyway, so I was going through the Gmail,

445
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,880
and I found a piece of audio feedback from a couple of weeks ago.

446
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,880
But it's about the same stuff that we're talking about now

447
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
about these Google Maps and GPS files and how to integrate those

448
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
with podcasts and with pictures.

449
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,880
And I got this piece of audio feedback, which, as I said,

450
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
is a little late in being on the show,

451
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
but better late than never.

452
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
And it's still appropriate to the topic.

453
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Hey Adam, this is JT from the FMlogicBox podcast.

454
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,880
And I was just listening to your latest daily source code

455
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,880
and heard that you were wondering about GPS and how to tie that

456
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,880
into MP3s and how to synchronize the video or the photograph,

457
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
and things like that.

458
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Well, you may want to investigate the dot MP4 audio format.

459
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
I was just talking about that in my latest podcast,

460
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
number 22, and that should be coming out tonight

461
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
for August 5th.

462
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,880
But in any case, I didn't go into any depth on how to use that,

463
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
but, and I don't really know.

464
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,880
But it apparently allows you to add avatars and 2D,

465
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,880
and 3D animation and certainly still photos,

466
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,880
because it is the video format of the M4A file format

467
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,880
that is used in iTunes and for iPods,

468
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,880
and it's a higher compression ratio than the MP3 format.

469
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,880
But that would most certainly allow you to synchronize the,

470
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
pictures with the audio.

471
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
I think it would have to.

472
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,880
So I know that you didn't want to develop that on your own,

473
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,880
but you may want to pass that along to whoever you do want to do the development for you.

474
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,880
And I hope that helps, and thanks again for all of your daily source codes.

475
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,880
I listen to them every time they come out, as soon as they come out.

476
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,880
But I don't pain your sight every five seconds,

477
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
time to get them.

478
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
I just wait for it to be delivered.

479
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,880
So in any case, have a great day, and I hope you can get that working,

480
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
because I'm really curious about that myself.

481
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
Okay, so yeah, well thank you, JT.

482
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
I've got it figured out.

483
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,880
I know exactly what this should be and how it should work.

484
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,880
And if I liked what JT was saying, you know,

485
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,880
whoever's going to develop that for you.

486
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
All right.

487
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,880
So I do know that what I have noticed when you provide data,

488
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,880
when you are providing a stream of cool data like this flying data,

489
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,880
which definitely is, you know, it's interesting because, you know,

490
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
it's, you know, I was flying, you know,

491
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,880
and you can see certain things you wouldn't see when driving.

492
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Developers do like that.

493
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,880
And it does get people's juices flowing.

494
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,880
So I'm going to continue to just, you know, make GPS data available.

495
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,880
I have, of course, had to get off my ass and out of the cottage to go to go get some data.

496
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,880
But I know, but the MDA should be able to do this.

497
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Here's how I think it should work.

498
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,880
In essence, you want your one device and I'm going to say it's my MDA telefilm

499
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,880
because it has all this stuff built into it.

500
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,880
And you, you have a little application and you start the application

501
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
and it's doing a number of things.

502
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,880
The first thing is doing is it's recording audio.

503
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,880
And it's, it's recording audio, you know,

504
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,880
just like you would first sound seeing tour and the MDA can do that.

505
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,880
So, of course, you'd want to have an external microphone plugged in.

506
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Please, that's not even necessary.

507
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
It's just recording audio.

508
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,880
At the same time, it's recording the GPS data.

509
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,880
That's coming out of the Bluetooth GPS receiver.

510
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,880
And it's basically, I don't know if it's writing

511
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,880
that was all to one file or not, but that's irrelevant.

512
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,880
So as let's say, I'm, I'm doing one of my trips.

513
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,880
So we're flying along and then, you know,

514
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,880
I'd just be narrating like any, but the hell is that?

515
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
Someone else's flying along.

516
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
I'd just be narrating like, you know,

517
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
like any other sound seeing tour or not,

518
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,880
doesn't matter because, you know, there's no penalty for the recording.

519
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,880
Then if at any point, I see something that's of interest,

520
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,880
I can take the MDA and snap a picture.

521
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,880
I was like, oh, I needed a sound effect.

522
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
I didn't have one.

523
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,880
I got these cool sound effects working on the Yamaha by the way.

524
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Okay, so I'd take a picture.

525
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Man, that sucks.

526
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
I like that one, that's a good one.

527
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,880
So I'd take a picture and it tags that somehow in this application.

528
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
So when I go back and I'm back home,

529
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
I synchronize my MDA.

530
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,880
It takes this data and what it should be creating is a Google map

531
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,880
where whenever a picture was taken,

532
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
there's a little flag so you can mouse over that

533
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
and then see the picture.

534
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,880
And of course, it could be some extra data entered there.

535
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,880
But at any point that in the path,

536
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,880
you should be able to click on the path and hear the audio

537
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,880
that was recorded at that point.

538
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
You see, because then you can,

539
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,880
it's almost like a museum tour and you can kind of determine

540
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,880
where you want to go in or want to go out.

541
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Anyway, so I'm not quite sure how that would work

542
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
and I'm not quite sure what the viewer is.

543
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
It sounds almost like what have to be something

544
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
and flashed to make it work.

545
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,880
But I can totally see that being very interesting

546
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
and very compelling.

547
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
I can see business cases for that.

548
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,880
So if you develop up for Windows Mobile,

549
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
give it a shot.

550
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Hello, Adam.

551
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
My name is Mark Anderson,

552
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,880
and I'm the host of a podcast called Shakespeare Upon iPod.

553
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
As the name suggests,

554
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
this podcast is about Shakespeare,

555
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
but there's a twist here.

556
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
There's been an undercurrent of scholarships

557
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
since the 1920s, in fact,

558
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
that has been looking at the life and troubled times

559
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,880
of a Elizabethan court poet playwright named Edward Devere,

560
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
who, more and more evidence suggests,

561
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,880
wrote under the pen name William Shakespeare.

562
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Devere led an amazing and epic and very Shakespearean life.

563
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,880
He got into an interfamily war between his family

564
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
and his mistress's family,

565
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
regular Elizabethan monogues and capilets.

566
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Devere spent a year touring France and Italy,

567
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
visiting the locations where many Shakespeare plays

568
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
with later be said.

569
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Devere's sister was a temperamental fireball

570
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
who was wooed by a swashbuckler,

571
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
named Paragon Birdie,

572
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
and this courtship is spoofed

573
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
in Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew.

574
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Devere had his own problems with anger management, too,

575
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
when Devere was returning from Italy,

576
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
one of his servants are really ego.

577
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Whispered hints of Devere's wife's infidelity

578
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
into Devere's ear.

579
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,880
This marital strife was played out throughout the Shakespeare canon

580
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
in plays such as a fellow,

581
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
much to do about nothing,

582
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
the Witter's Tale, and a number of others.

583
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
The list goes on and on,

584
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
of the astonishing parallels between Devere's life

585
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,880
and the storylines in the Shakespeare canon.

586
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
It just takes one shift of focus,

587
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
away from Stratford upon Avon,

588
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
and toward Edward Devere,

589
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,880
to reveal the astonishing layers of autobiography

590
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
to be found in Shakespeare.

591
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
The reason it hasn't been recognized before

592
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
is that people have for centuries been looking

593
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
at the wrong guy,

594
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
an entrepreneur and actor

595
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
from Stratford upon Avon.

596
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
The Shakespeare upon iPod podcasts

597
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,880
have been adapted from a biography of Devere

598
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
that I've written,

599
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
and that Gotham Books will be publishing

600
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
on August 8th.

601
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,880
The biography has titled Shakespeare by another name,

602
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,880
the life of Edward Devere Earl of Oxford,

603
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
the man who was Shakespeare.

604
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Music fans may be interested to note

605
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,880
that one of the producers of Shakespeare upon iPod

606
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,880
is Chris Collingwood of the Power Pop Band

607
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Fountains of Wayne.

608
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
So, now that the book is out,

609
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
I'm going to be repodcasting

610
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
the whole Shakespeare upon iPod series.

611
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
That's all nine episodes

612
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
from August through October,

613
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,880
starting with episode one on August 13th.

614
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
To hear Shakespeare upon iPod,

615
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,880
go to the podcast section of the iTunes music store

616
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
and do a keyword search for Shakespeare.

617
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,880
Or, just check out my book

618
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
and my podcast website

619
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,880
at Shakespeare by anothername.com.

620
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,880
That's Shakespeare by anothername.com.

621
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
On Show.com,

622
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
makes no claims regarding the quality

623
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
of its pod shows

624
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
or the sanity of its producers.

625
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Listen at your own risk.

626
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Hi, this is Jeff from podcastshuffle.com

627
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,880
telling you about the podcast shuffle show.

628
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
You know,

629
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
I was going to talk a lot about

630
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
what's the podcast shuffle show

631
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
but I think you should hear

632
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
from one of our listeners,

633
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Bob Hayes from MotoGPOD.

634
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
He sums it up pretty good.

635
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
I finally got around

636
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
to subscribing to the actual podcast

637
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
in iTunes last week.

638
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
And it's pretty darn entertaining.

639
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,880
It's similar to Adam Curry's pod finder show

640
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
except that it has this great

641
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
indie feel to it

642
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
that I think I like it so much better.

643
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
It's not like it's amateur

644
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
or bad or anything.

645
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
But it just has more

646
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
it's more like

647
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
what I sort of think a true podcast should sound like.

648
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Thanks Bob.

649
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
You can head over to podcastshuffle.com

650
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
and subscribe to the show

651
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
or you can find it in iTunes

652
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
by searching for podcast shuffle show.

653
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
Thanks for subscribing,

654
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
and I hope you listen in.

655
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
Oh.

656
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Well,

657
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
harsh mind mellow.

658
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
It's like a daily source of code.

659
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Like no,

660
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
it wasn't as like pod finder.

661
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Only better.

662
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
All right.

663
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Thank you.

664
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Let's see,

665
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
what's the time?

666
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
32.

667
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Okay.

668
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
Well, I'd say we have

669
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
to do some pod safe music.

670
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Right?

671
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Oh, that's right.

672
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,880
I have one more thing that I wanted to play for you.

673
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,880
And this is from Christopher Penn from the financial aid pod cast

674
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
who's his audio feedback is really nice.

675
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
It's almost like he sent me

676
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
pod cast that are audio feedback.

677
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,880
And the title of his message here was

678
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
the million listener march.

679
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,880
Of course, that got my attention when I saw that in the Gmail.

680
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,880
And I listened to what he's saying

681
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
and he's absolutely right.

682
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,880
There's an important event about to happen.

683
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Or actually he's going to happen over the course of the next few weeks.

684
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
And very important as it pertains to pod casting.

685
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Hey, and I'm Christopher,

686
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
the financial aid pod cast with some audio feedback

687
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
about the hundred million listeners march.

688
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
The revolution may be on,

689
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
but the revolution needs troops right now.

690
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
There's an army of millions moving into place.

691
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,880
And the next four weeks will determine

692
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
whether that army becomes slaves

693
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
to the big record companies,

694
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
whether they join the pod casting revolution.

695
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,880
That army is the army of millions of college students who have been away

696
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
away for the summer, away from ubiquitous broadband

697
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
and iTunes upgrades.

698
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
As they move in, they come back to school.

699
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Pod castors have the chance to capture their hearts,

700
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
minds, and especially their ears.

701
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
In the times in school that out the maze,

702
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
so much has happened.

703
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Things like iTunes, 4.9,

704
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Hot City, Music Network.

705
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Bruce Box said somebody heard the call.

706
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Well, here's the call of the pod castors everywhere.

707
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Get the word out to college students everywhere,

708
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
as they come back to school.

709
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Tell them about pod safe music about pod cast,

710
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
about the revolution.

711
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Get them involved.

712
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
If you're a pod castor, reach out and ask college students

713
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,880
in your audience to spread the word.

714
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,880
If you're a college student, spread the word to everyone you know.

715
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,880
College radio is ripe for music from the pod safe music network.

716
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,880
And college radio stations are always a needed great program.

717
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
Pod castor can fit the bill just as well,

718
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
on terrestrial college radio stations as online.

719
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Finally, let the college students know that pod cast

720
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
isn't one way street.

721
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,880
Most students have the latest and greatest hardware

722
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
and software for school,

723
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
and garage vanda cast blaster,

724
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
only a couple of flicks away.

725
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Point new pod guestors to podcastalley.com.

726
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
HotGest411.com.

727
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
And indiepodder.org.

728
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Now you've heard the call.

729
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Enjoying the revolution, bring your friends.

730
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Thanks a lot out of.

731
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Keep a great work as always.

732
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Hopefully, in the formal weeks,

733
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
we'll have millions of new listeners.

734
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
This is Chris from the financial aid pod cast at

735
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880

736
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880

741
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,880

742
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
band with together.

743
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,880
And indeed, podcaster perfect content

744
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880

745
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,880
So that's right.

746
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Keep them informed.

758
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Sally went down.

759
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,880
Sally went down.

760
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Sally went down.

761
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Sally went down.

762
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Sally went down.

763
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,880
When I see my nut to the half-layer now

What's good like her gonna do?

765

Sattin' never made it to the road

766
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Never saw the night never even heard the train coming

767
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Sattin' I went walked on the track

768

Keepin' down, walkin' on the track

But she kept her head down, she kept her head down, she kept her head down, she kept her head down

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,880
