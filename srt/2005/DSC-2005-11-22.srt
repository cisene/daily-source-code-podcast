1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-84

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
$60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We don't need lost digging crazy.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm just kidding, it's Adam Curry.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And hello everybody, good morning coming to you from Curry Cottage and Gilfer.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And the United Kingdom, it is your daily source code.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I still feel like crap, just why I think this particular song

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to kind of get me through the start of the show.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm just gently pissed about how I'm feeling.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Health is everything my friends.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Starting off your Tuesday source code.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is available from San Francisco's griddle.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've been looking at you now to come again.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We only want to know in this place.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We want you out.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We just see all your friends.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let me hope that I'll be able to meet you again.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's see all the food on your back.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Cause it's you, come.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've changed that into a picture.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm available.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm available.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll be there to a picture.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You know this.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where you waiting for someone to talk to you.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Those who might be high on their masks of cool.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You won't just zip as me.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Too bad for all.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm swimming on the floor.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Sorry, but cause it's you, come.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've changed that into a picture.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You know what is the spell to throw.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But what's the main last thing?

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You gotta keep coming back to me.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm available.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll be there to a picture.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Tell me what's there.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Things that you found all of me.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's something that you found me too.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Tell me what's there.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Things that you found all of me.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Things that you found all of me.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Kicking off your daily source code.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's critical.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And available.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I heard that song yesterday on a new podcast.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The ultimate podcast.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The ultimate mix, ultimate mix, ultimate mix, weblog and podcast.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And the point of that podcast is to play.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The ultimate from the podcast is music now.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Totally dig into vibe there.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
As you can tell, I'm still pretty stuffed up.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't have a very good night's sleep.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This morning woke up around 730 to take Christina to school.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
As I really enjoyed doing this morning was not an enjoyable experience.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think maybe I should talk about that first and get off my mind.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's things with 15 year olds.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is parents.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I know we got mommy casters and daddy casters.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Everyone's listening up.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What a dilemma this is.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
With a 15 year old.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
A lot of borrowing goes on in a house.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
A lot of borrowing.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Luckily none of my stuff.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's make up.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's eyebrow pencils.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And it's tweezers.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And shampoo.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And God knows what.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It usually doesn't affect me.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But Patricia will usually bitch about it and go retrieve it.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And it's I think that what's been building a little bit here is a bit of lack of respect for other people's stuff.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Maybe just stuff in general.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Christina is very good at losing her house.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
She's good at losing herself.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She's good at losing a lot of stuff.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then there's the 50 pounds that Patricia gave her last week at school money.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You know, you're supposed to give it to the school, so the school can do extra stuff.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And she put it in the envelope.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And then, you know, that wound up in the trash by accident.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She retrieved it from the trash.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It was literally in the, this is all last week when it wasn't here.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It was in the garage where it ready for trash pick up day.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And the this morning Patricia inquired again.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Christina said, oh, oh, no, I haven't haven't given that yet.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, where is it?

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I can't find it.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or it's a particularly early in the morning that that made for a very grumpy start of the day.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I'm just trying to help my teenager understand that, you know, if it's 50 pounds, 5 pounds, 50 pence, 5 pence, or 5 million, it doesn't matter.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You know, you have to have respect for what stuff is and who it's intended for.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And I'm having a parental moment here.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, you know, and then, I don't know, well, that we'll talk about it.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe she'll actually find it, but she just seems so easy about it all.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I want to understand that it isn't all that easy.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And part of that part of that comes a consistency between what mom says and what dad says.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And I think this is stuff that everyone deals with all the time.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And it's not the end of the world because we're all reasonably healthy.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But man, I just really put me in a fucking bad mood.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And we'll have lots of interesting moods to listen to today during the source code.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because we've got feedback in all shapes, sizes and forms.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Some about some stuff I messed up on.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And some just about, well, general topics, like I'd recommend.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hi, Adam, this is Chris from the financial aid podcast with some feedback about the earthling sponsorship.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The first thing is that the sponsorship, the ad on DSC282 did nothing for me because it was so commercially.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It felt like it was spliced right on a magic one of 6.7 and into the DSC.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And I'm so trained by mainstream media.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So ignore all the ads that I literally did not hear it.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I had to go back to the show and listen to it again.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And it still didn't make much of an impression.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The thing about podcasting, that's so cool about podcasting.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because we have so much more freedom than mainstream media.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We don't have to resort to 30 second genitals.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We don't have to listen to music hits that are exactly 305.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We have all the freedom.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So it would be great to hear some more lengthy ads or some sponsorships that really connect.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I used to be an earthling member until my cable company came out with a gigantic 7 megabit pipe that lets me download the DSC in 30 seconds.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But when it wasn't earthling member, the things I liked most, when I dialed in, I didn't get it busy signal.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I got reliable connections. I got fast bandwidth.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And they don't filter their use networks.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So if you were interested in downloading binaries and the binaries and use groups, they didn't screen that.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They didn't filter that. They didn't censor you.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You know, earthling, the technical support was reasonably good.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But really, the access to bandwidth and stuff was so important for me that it really made a difference.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And that's why I wasn't earthling member until my cable company came out with, you know, the gigantic fire hose of internet connection.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Incidentally, earthling wants my business back.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They need to offer the same kind of access at a competitive price.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And hey, I'll be more than happy to jump right back on board with them.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just some feedback from Chris from the Financial Aid podcast.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Check it out at financialadpodcast.com.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I'll see you around. Have a great day, Adam.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, Chris, thank you very much.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And that's a great endorsement, actually.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I completely agree with what you were saying about earthling.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I also agree with what you said about hearing the ad.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And that basically either came from them or from their ad agency.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And I felt the contrast was so large between that one and the AOL music ad that's been running on the network,

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
which we had griddlekakes.com produced actually for us.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And what I like about it is it doesn't, you know, the AOL music promo, I think, is much more effective.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And in fact, it sounds like a promo, which is why I like it so much.

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So I'm going to suggest, and I know that not all of us who listen to the show,

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
diligently every day from this pod show cubicle will work with me on getting some new creative in for earthling.

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Because I agree, it sounded like something different.

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It didn't feel right, didn't fit right.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So it made me cut up what you just said and use that.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And that's a great testimony.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I totally agree.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And I understand the seven megabits if they offer that that you gladly take them back.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm not too sure about a, about bandwidth anymore.

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You know, I pay through the nose for four megabits on a dedicated line because that's all I could get.

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But sometimes I wonder if it's, you know, the upstream is never been, you know, the 500k that they said it would be.

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's a 350 at best, usually more on 2 to 300.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I've heard varying results on cable systems.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I have a Comcast in at the condo in San Francisco.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That seems to be working okay, but the upstream there is even worse.

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I wish this was an audio feedback, but it's, it was so good.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I want to read it to you.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Brian Polensky says, an award should go to the Virgin Airlines gate attendant in Sydney.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Some months ago for being customer focused while making her point.

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
When confronted with a passenger who probably deserved to fly in cattle cargo.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So here's the scene.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
A crowded version flight was canceled after version 767 has been with drawn from service.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
A single attendant was rebooking a long line of inconvenience traveler.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way to the desk.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He slapped his ticket down the counter and said, I have to be on this flight and it has to be first class.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Which I don't even have, of course.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The attendant replied, I'm sorry, sir.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll be happy to help you, but I've got to help these people first.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I'm sure we'll be able to work something out.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The passenger was unimpressed.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sure it was an American, so I'll do him in American voice.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He asked loudly, so the passengers are present who can hear.

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you have any idea who I am?

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Without hesitating, the attendant smiled grabbed her PA microphone and said,

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
May I have your attention, please?

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Wait, let me do this.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There we go.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
May I have your attention, please?

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We have a passenger here at Gate 14 who does not know who he is.

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If anyone can help him, find his identity, please come to Gate 14.

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That worked out pretty good.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically,

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the man glared at the virgin attendant,

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
gritted his teeth and said, fuck you!

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Without flinching, she smiled and said,

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to get in line for that as well.

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, hi, Mr. Nice guy.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Ooh, some fun on Mr. Nice guy shows one ninety five and six with me,

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
marve, as I talk with Dr. Alan Ray.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I got this itching problem.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No, no, he's a comedy writer who's written for J. Leno,

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Dick Cavitt, the capital steps, and he's a PhD professor of broad casting.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Still wise, there's not a lot to teach anymore.

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You know, it's been a lot of time on equipment.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's great, so it frees you up to talk about issues,

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
talk about ethics.

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What do you make of podcasting?

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Make you think and make you smile.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The Mr. Nice guy show, mr. Nice guy dot O R G.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hello, this is Keith Richards at the Rowling Stones.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Whenever I'm in the neighborhood,

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I stop in the Murphy's saloon for a big Guinness doubt.

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They had a best pose around.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Right.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Hey, what's up, Adam and all you daily source code listeners.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
My name is Zach Winnick and I have a new podcast called

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Sounds with Einstein.

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ooh.

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Some say oh.

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Anyway, so basically what I do on the sounds with Einstein is

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
talk about life in Las Vegas.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yes, Las Vegas Nevada and Las Vegas, New Mexico because

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Las Vegas, Mexico would be pretty boring doing you think.

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Anyway, so I've talked about life in general.

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I work at one of the major casinos here.

219
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You have to listen to the show to find out which one.

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But basically, I just ran to about my job,

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
living life out here, especially all the stupid people that drive.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The stupid weather that we have, especially when it snows

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
in January.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What is that?

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It doesn't snow in the desert or when it's 120 degrees

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and at two o'clock in the morning.

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But then I also play some great blues and jazz music

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that you can find on the Podsafe Music Network.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So anyway, check us out.

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Sound with Einstein.com and thanks for listening.

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Hock, Captain Curry, do not be afraid.

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We bring tidings of great joy.

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
My buddy Jeremy and I have been sent to you

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
from the city of Melbourne, Australia

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
to bring you the news that your cries have been heard from afar.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's right, Adam.

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We know how hard the past few months have been since the passing

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
of e-fakeful G4 Titanium Powerbook

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and the devastation that this is caused throughout Curry Cottage.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, yes.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We are sure that there were periods of sadness

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and at times anger.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
When you look to the heavens and cry.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why?

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Questions no doubt formed in your mind.

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
As to why bad things happen to go power books.

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Will the old faithful happy?

248
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Remember you when you meet again in heaven?

249
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Hmm.

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, poignant.

251
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's somewhat ridiculous questions.

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But all deserve answers.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Do we have them?

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No way.

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I'll show the god find a podcast

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and certainly point you to the people who might.

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The god find a podcast stems from its system podcast,

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
but pod finder and is the sole map to Christian content

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
on the digital airwaves.

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Each week we feature some of the latest and most powerful Christian podcast

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
that deal with the real issues of the 21st century.

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You and all your listeners can check us out by searching for god finder, one word

263
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
in the iTunes directory or going to www.godfindepodcast.com

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
God finder.

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Where the search for truth begins.

266
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Guys, more echo, please.

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I go in more cowbell.

268
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That'll help.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So I got burned via audio comment the other day about not having followed up on the MM50

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Logitech MM50 speaker contest.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Apparently we had a contest going.

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So now I've gone back in the Gmail and a couple of people have now written in with thoughts

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
for renaming the product.

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is a great way to advertise.

275
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Hey, come and rename the product.

276
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And I see that one of my programs here is basically freezing, which won't help me very much.

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So I can read the first three until my outline unfreezes.

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's see, this is from Michael T. Garlic, garlic.

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It says, how about mighty minis?

280
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
MM50s.

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, I did that mighty minis.

282
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That sounds pretty good.

283
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do we have Eric Fisher?

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I say call the MM50 the headrest entertainer or the head entertainment center.

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The slogan goes something like this.

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's like TV for your headrest.

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay.

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't quit the day job.

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
On demand entertainment.

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
When you're on the go.

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
All right, Eric.

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Thank you.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Let me see.

294
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, man.

295
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This fucking thing is.

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why is it bogging out here?

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay.

298
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Douglas Yoda says, how about the Logitech earwig, the Logitech beat buddy?

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I like the beat buddy.

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I need some now.

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The Logitech speaker power, 2000.

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Or wait.

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The Logitech port iPoddy.

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Port iPoddy.

305
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I like that one.

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's good.

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Port Dash iPoddy.

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Very good.

309
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Paul Sullivan says looks sort of like a boom box.

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'd call it the iPoddy.

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think so far, the port iPoddy is pretty damn good.

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And we got some audio feedback about the topic as well.

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
At least.

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There we go.

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's Nick.

316
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I was just listening to Delta Sierra Charlie 283.

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I thought it'd help you out rebranding the Logitech MM50.

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think it should be called the Portable Bump.

319
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You could take here.

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Anywhere you please.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay.

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Portable Bump.

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm still liking the Porto Party.

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's working the best for me.

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Here's a different piece of feedback about the MM50.

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Hi, Adam.

327
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This is Melinda Mason from the My Maryland podcast.

328
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I have a quick question for you about the MM50 iPod speakers.

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm putting it tentatively on my wishlist for Santa.

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But I wanted to check on the compatibility between it and the new video iPod.

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I just got myself my iPod.

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And I love it.

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I upgraded actually from a black and white generation fourth generation iPod.

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So just to have a color.

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wow, it's pretty cool.

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And the video is just an absolute bonus.

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Of course, I've got it filled with Maryland and Earl Clips.

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But, you know, that's just me, I guess.

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So my question is, since you have both of these items.

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Are these speakers going to scratch my new baby up?

341
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm trying to take really good care of her.

342
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So I'd like to know how the fit is in the dock portion.

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You know, where you plug the iPod in.

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you have to really squeeze it in there to get it to fit?

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Or does it?

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do I need any kind of an adapter to make it work with the speakers?

347
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If you could address those issues for me, I would really appreciate it.

348
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Thanks.

349
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah.

350
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Sorry about that.

351
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Well, Linda Mason from the My Maryland podcast.

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Big fan of the show.

353
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll be fan of her show that is.

354
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You know, first of all, your iPod is going to get scratched.

355
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's crap.

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I have the black video iPod.

357
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You know, I'd used the three times maybe.

358
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And it was scratched all over the face.

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So just, you know, get over it.

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's going to get scratched.

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I have successfully put it into the MM50.

362
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Now what they've done is they have a

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
slot that will fit any generation iPod.

364
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And they give you adapters, which are pieces of plastic that slide into the slot.

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So that your iPod will fit snugly.

366
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Honestly, what I'd like to get.

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'd like to get an opinion from Logitech first to find out about the compatibility with the new video iPod.

368
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Before I recommend anything to you, Melinda.

369
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So I'll get that to you tomorrow as well.

370
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I know exactly who's listening, who's going to take care of that.

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And thank you.

372
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

373
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I can't.

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Kim sent this in.

375
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I love your show.

376
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Listen every day.

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Decided to tune in with Pacific Coast Hellway.

378
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Played your sound by it.

379
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Cool.

380
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I love it when I get traffic from someone else.

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Now I'm hooked.

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I listen to four to 12 hours a day while installing satellites for the dish network.

383
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I know you didn't want people to send you MP3 files with email, but I couldn't figure out how to do it properly.

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Blow it.

385
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay.

386
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Listen to this clip.

387
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Tell me what you think.

388
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm wondering for votes to non podcast listeners is definitely a breach of etiquette.

389
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm interested in your response.

390
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And what she sent me is indeed one of the top podcasts as listed on podcast alley.

391
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's a free talk live, which has been a radio show since I think 2002.

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And they've always made their archives available online.

393
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And this is what they're doing on the air.

394
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And you can join us online free talk live dot com.

395
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We give you everything for free on our website at free talk live dot com.

396
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And if you appreciate that, you want to show your appreciation.

397
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We have to do as vote for us.

398
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's a once a month kind of thing.

399
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You just go to vote dot free talk live dot com.

400
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Take your straight to where you need to be at podcast alley because we're home.

401
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hold on.

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The first of all, that's really smart.

403
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
They've done a really cool thing.

404
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
They've given you a direct URL to type in.

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So that you go immediately to the voting section for their podcast on podcast alley.

406
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's just really smart marketing and a great idea.

407
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So that right off.

408
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And by the way, that's a, let me just write that down.

409
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We should be able to offer any podcast or that wouldn't that be cool.

410
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay.

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Let's remember this, that any podcast should be able to have like, you know, vote

412
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
dsc dot podcast alley dot com.

413
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Wouldn't that be cool if we could do that?

414
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And that would be your link.

415
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
God.

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It would be nice.

417
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And much easier to remember than go to podcast alley and vote for our show.

418
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So first of all, they're just smart.

419
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Let's continue here for a second.

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We're radio show first and foremost, but then once the shows over,

421
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
we shop up, shop up the show and put it online as a podcast.

422
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
As a result of your votes, we're the number three podcast in the world.

423
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That's out of about 10,000 different podcasts.

424
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And admittedly, we're relatively new show.

425
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And this is a great way for us to get listeners.

426
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We have thousands of listeners from podcast in the podcast arena.

427
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But you don't have to be a podcast listener to go vote for the show.

428
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Well, voting for the show brings us more listeners because of being number three or

429
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
possibly two or number one.

430
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Right.

431
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So there's a number of things that work.

432
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I think people who have figured it out really understand how this works.

433
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So first of all, they have a great way to get to the voting page.

434
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Second of all, they probably have a reasonably large audience on the radio.

435
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm not sure how big it is.

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm not sure what this program is broadcast and what the potential listening audience is.

437
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But also things that are in the top 10 to get listened to and, you know,

438
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
it's perpetual motion almost.

439
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's the same with iTunes and they basically, they're top 100 is comprised of new

440
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
subscriptions through the iTunes music store to a podcast in a certain period.

441
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I think it's 24 hours.

442
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So if something is featured is also going to automatically go up in the top 100.

443
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
If it's in the top 100, people find it.

444
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
There's more new subscriptions and it just keeps on propelling them up,

445
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
which I think is actually a pretty damn good way of looking at the top 100.

446
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But what is it the top 100 of?

447
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You rarely see the daily source code there.

448
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You rarely, I don't think you see daily source code in the top 10 on podcast

449
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
down there anymore either.

450
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And, you know, so you have a kind of like a base and then actually once a while,

451
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll go on a campaign, I'll promote my own show.

452
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I do it on the pod finder.

453
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll put a mention at the end of the show that people continue to the daily source code.

454
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
These are things.

455
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I don't think there is any fair way or non fair way, you know, come on.

456
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
If you want to get listeners, then every way counts.

457
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Another fantastic thing I've seen is putting a dash in a space before your,

458
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
before the name of your podcast and your RSS feed.

459
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That way it shows up at the top of iTunes.

460
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I've seen a couple of podcasts to do that.

461
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Now, please don't all go doing it because,

462
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll shoot up, give it in a way.

463
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No, have an eye.

464
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Screw it.

465
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
All right, next topic.

466
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This is about the Christmas song.

467
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The pod safe music Christmas extravaganza choir.

468
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't have to explain it to you because I have a piece of Kevin Reeves podcast,

469
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
which I caught just yesterday, and I'm going to kind of skip through,

470
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
but I want him to do the explanation of what we're trying to achieve here.

471
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Kind of the history of what happened.

472
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This is from his, from his most recent podcast.

473
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Hey, kids, welcome to a special edition of Studioography.

474
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
My name is Kevin Reeves.

475
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And today, what we're going to do is we're currently working on,

476
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
if every day we're Christmas, which is the pod safe Christmas tune

477
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
that everybody's kind of joining in on and putting their two cents in.

478
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But for those of you who are not current residents of the podosphere

479
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and aren't really aware of what's going on, let me explain.

480
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
A couple weeks ago, Adam Curry from the Daily Source Code

481
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
had put out this challenge to all everybody.

482
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
He said, I am looking for a quintessential Christmas song

483
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
that we can play the hell out of.

484
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You know, like, you turn on the pop radio and everybody's playing,

485
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
you know, simply having a lot of Christmas time.

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You know, that is the quintessential pop Christmas song.

487
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You know, along with, you know, white Christmas and all that.

488
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But, you know, Adam was looking for the quintessential pod safe Christmas tune

489
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
that could be kind of the holiday hit.

490
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
In response, a friend of mine by the name of Slaw,

491
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
posted this tune that he had co-written with a friend of his about a year ago.

492
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Now, I met Slaw in New York about, that was about, oh,

493
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and actually it's been two years now because I met Slaw in New York

494
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Christmas of O3 while I was on Martha's Vineyard at Music School.

495
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We took a trip to New York and I took a day and went to his studio and hung out.

496
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And he said, hey, I just finished this tune, you want to check it out.

497
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And it was, if every day, we're Christmas.

498
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
He had just kind of demoed it and stuff like that.

499
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So he had this tune and he uploaded it to the pod safe music network.

500
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And Adam Curry just completely went nuts over it.

501
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And he said, all right, well, why can't we do like a band-aid kind of deal?

502
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We are the world kind of thing.

503
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And get all the pod safe artists to join in and do this big, huge,

504
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
anthem Christmas chorus kind of thing.

505
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And then we'll have the top pod safe artists.

506
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The brother loves and the bitties and, you know, the 46 blisters and the,

507
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
you know, all the, all the top people sing all the choruses.

508
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You know, are sing the verses and have solo parts.

509
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And so there we are.

510
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Slaw is now completely engrossed in this project.

511
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And he sent me the tracks and said, hey, why don't you get started on this?

512
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Do the, you know, do the choruses.

513
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And so that's what we're going to do today.

514
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm currently standing in the vocal booth and in front of my other keyboard here that controls

515
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Pro Tools.

516
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So this is where it gets really cool.

517
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He actually walks us through the process of him recording parts of the chorus.

518
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And what's happened is Slaw has made all these tracks available.

519
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You know, the different pieces of the harmony for the chorus.

520
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And he's basically put a whole kit together.

521
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And anyone who wants to join can go to music.podshow.com.

522
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And there's a link there and from there you can get the information about how to

523
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
participate in the song.

524
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And I'm really excited because Slaw was invited Patricia to do some of the, you know,

525
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
to do a solo piece.

526
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So that means that I get to engineer it.

527
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And I'm really excited about that.

528
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And I think by December 1st, that's kind of the deadline is when we want to have this thing out.

529
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Which, of course, is a little bit late for a hold on.

530
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Listen to just a bit here of how it does all this stuff.

531
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
All right, so have that instrumental.

532
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And then I've got to let me fast forward a bit.

533
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Hold on a second.

534
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
All right.

535
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I've unsulled it.

536
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And now this is really cool.

537
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And he has some kind of feedback on the buttons that he's trying to do it.

538
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Okay.

539
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Listen to him.

540
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
He's going to sing a piece now.

541
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And he can go.

542
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Apparently you have to say shit a lot when you're doing this work.

543
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
This and make it work.

544
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But here we go.

545
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Check it out.

546
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh shit.

547
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Okay.

548
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
We would never.

549
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Let's see how well I did.

550
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
All right.

551
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Let's just listen to this one piece.

552
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Let's solo.

553
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It's so cool because I learned so much about doing it.

554
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Just through listening to his podcast.

555
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Here's the click track.

556
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And now you're just hearing this.

557
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Oh, I see why that's not working on it.

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He's got to put his vocals in.

559
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And auto input.

560
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Here's the feedback on his computer.

561
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's really cool.

562
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Here we come.

563
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That is absolutely shite.

564
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So check that out.

565
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's with a lot of a link to it in the show notes.

566
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Very, very, very, very, very cool.

567
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And I can't wait to participate.

568
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And by engineering Patricia on this.

569
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm really excited about this whole project.

570
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Hey Adam.

571
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
This is Sarah Fisher from Marion, Indiana.

572
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm a blogger and podcaster.

573
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And I could not help but see the ad or the blurb over at podshow.

574
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The biggest promotion and podcasting is about to hit you right.

575
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Between the years, ambition will you be ready.

576
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Well, I just got to say Adam.

577
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Heck, yes, I am ready.

578
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
To not wait to hear what this is about.

579
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Just got to say very excited.

580
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Can't wait.

581
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Of all the things.

582
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I mean, a friend of mine and I were working on our podcast right now.

583
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We haven't started yet.

584
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But we've recorded some material.

585
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We're getting our mic set up to the best sound quality.

586
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Getting our beds and our pot safe music ready.

587
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And writing our material and seeing where we can improvise upon that.

588
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But the place where we really need to help is just the promotion of our podcast.

589
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The network for it to sail upon.

590
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So anyway, just wanted to draw a line and say we are very excited.

591
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Can't wait to see what comes out because we'd love to get in on that.

592
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So hey, if you've been made a testing or anything or whatever.

593
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Hey, just let me know.

594
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I am all about it.

595
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So Dr. later, thanks for the shows.

596
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
See ya.

597
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And for any listeners out there, my blog is Eric Wrights.

598
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That's Eric with a K.

599
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Wrights.

600
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Block spot.com.

601
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
All right.

602
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Thank you very much.

603
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Well, good news.

604
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The audition will be for every podcast or anybody.

605
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
With you have a podcast or not.

606
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And we're going to start unfolding details of that.

607
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Just keep watching podshow.com.

608
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You can subscribe to the RSS feed and podshow news.

609
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Because that's where it'll be posted as well.

610
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So you can get it automatically in your newsletter, your aggregator.

611
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Before we open it up to everybody, we'll be starting with what we're internally calling the Super 30.

612
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's a long story.

613
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What these people will be invited to come into the audition,

614
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
into the network.

615
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And we want a very personal relationship with them before we get started.

616
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Because when we really open the gates for everyone to participate.

617
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And this, by the way, is all related to our internal codename Q.Y.D.J.

618
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That's the name of the promotion Q.Y.D.J.

619
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Which means quit your day job.

620
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So yeah, the marketing, of course, all a part of the services we're going to provide at the podshow podcast delivery network.

621
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The advertising, helping you grow an audience, helping you bring in listeners.

622
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You helping us bring in listeners, making money.

623
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
All of that will be a part of what we're going to be offering to everybody.

624
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But also, and that's really what's going to be cool this audition.

625
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Where everybody can enter.

626
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And some of you will be able to literally quit your day job.

627
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And if people are still subscribed to your old feed, they don't receive updates anymore.

628
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I think we need to solve this problem, because this is something that can happen to a lot of podcasters at some point.

629
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
How can we relocate an RSS feed without losing listeners?

630
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Now, I'm not an expert, but here's my idea.

631
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Why not integrate a special tag in the RSS feed protocol that points to either a backup location of the RSS feed,

632
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
useful if, for instance, the main server on which your RSS feed is located goes down,

633
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
or with the future new location of the RSS feed, and perhaps even also the date when the relocation will happen.

634
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
If there were a tag like that, we could ask the various podcasters, like Jews, iPodracks, iTunes, etc.

635
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
To scan for that tag, and if they find it, make a change in the subscription data for that particular podcast.

636
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Say for instance, that I want to change the URL of the feed of my daily breakfast show to another server by Friday.

637
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I could mention the new location of the RSS feed plus the date of the change in my current feed,

638
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and when I launch iTunes on Friday, it will know that from that moment on, it will have to grab the RSS feed from the new location.

639
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
iTunes introduce some custom tags in the RSS feed sometime ago, so why not get together as podcasters,

640
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and launch general requests to all the makers of podcasters out there to integrate a tag like that?

641
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So these are just my two cents, I'm curious to know your thoughts about this, and by the way, get well soon.

642
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I think our road rig always there, friend and need.

643
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I love that music.

644
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Okay, well, unfortunately, I think we need some divine intervention to make that happen, father road rig.

645
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And of course, if anyone can call that upon us, it would be you, I'm hoping.

646
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I think what we're going to do in the meantime on the second is this someone calling, please say no.

647
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't know what that is.

648
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
All right, hold on, let me just check my calendar because that was some kind of calendar alert.

649
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
What am I missing?

650
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Okay, nothing, it's exactly what I thought.

651
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So we need some divine intervention for RSS to be extended that globally.

652
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I think that for what it's worth, iTunes actually has solved this if your feed changes because they're basically acting as a buffer in between the iTunes music store.

653
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
There is a tag you can set in there that will change the feed so that it'll update an iTunes.

654
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I think that's the only way to go, and it would be great.

655
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm sure the juice receiver has something like that already.

656
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It may detect a redirect feed.

657
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Maybe the thing to do is to create a small little directory of the different ways that all of the receivers handle this.

658
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And if you have built an iPod or pod catcher podcaster receiver.

659
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Please consider probably using the redirect method.

660
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So it'll recognize a feed that has a redirect tag in it so that it'll automatically change the subscription internally.

661
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I think we should probably get the juice guys to look at this if they haven't done it already.

662
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So please let me know and I'll make note of it because that's really the way to go.

663
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And of course the ultimate way is to have no feed lock in.

664
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
That's why yeah, you may be lucky quote lucky if you're doing this with feed burner,

665
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
but a feed burner goes down or something happens there or you disagree with what they do next.

666
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I mean anything like that could happen.

667
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Then you'll be stuck with feed burner.

668
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The other way to do this is through DNS because DNS works universally across the network across services.

669
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And when the pod show podcast delivery network launches will be offering a fantastic DNS service along with that so that you can basically set up,

670
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
you know, your podcast dot com slash the name of your feed dot XML or whatever we want it to be.

671
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And you will own your DNS registration so you can move it anywhere you want at any time.

672
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And we've teamed up with an excellent partner for that.

673
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh man, I'm telling you guys too much.

674
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Coming.

675
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh yeah.

676
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Coming to you from their bedroom.

677
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I mean their office.

678
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Welcome to the Pete and Renee show.

679
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Hi, I'm Pete.

680
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And I'm Renee.

681
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Our show is mainly about our lives here at the Jersey Shore.

682
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That's right.

683
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We talk about family, friends, relationships, sex.

684
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We also have a happy hour where we talk about drinks.

685
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And sex.

686
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And we may also talk about other people from time to time.

687
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And sex.

688
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And as you can tell, he's the only one.

689
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And sex.

690
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Oh, right.

691
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So come by and check us out at.

692
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Pete and Renee dot com.

693
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Pete and Renee dot com.

694
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Pete and Renee dot com.

695
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You won't be sorry.

696
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Why did you say it three times?

697
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So people won't forget.

698
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Everyone want to go to an adult bookstore.

699
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But we're afraid to come with us on one of our episodes.

700
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Or find out if Renee spins your swallows.

701
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Peter, is there anything sacred with us?

702
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Of course, honey.

703
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's just us and our fans.

704
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh, okay.

705
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I can handle that.

706
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So come by and check us out.

707
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The Pete and Renee show.

708
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
If you're an information technology professional,

709
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that typically finds themselves behind in the technology magazine and journal reading,

710
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
then check out technewsradio.com

711
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
for two potentially helpful podcasts.

712
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The first is tech rack tarots,

713
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
which comes out every two weeks and reviews latest in mainstream technology references

714
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
for news and resources from an enterprise system architecture perspective.

715
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
The second is techtivots daily,

716
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
which brings you short,

717
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
under four minutes technology pointers from new software

718
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to hot gadgets to conference notifications to productivity tips and tricks.

719
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000

Technewsradio.com is a proud member of techpodcast.com

724
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and friends in tech.com

725
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Hello.

726
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Hi, Mr. Nice Guy.

727
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Ooh, some fun on Mr. Nice Guy shows 195 and six with me,

728
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Marve, as I talk with Dr. Allen Rafe.

729
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I got this itching problem.

730
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
No, no, he's a comedy writer who's written for Jay Leno

731
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Dick Cavatt, the capital steps,

732
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and he's a PhD professor of broadcasting.

733
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
He's still wise, there's not a lot to teach anymore,

734
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
but you don't spend a lot of time on equipment.

735
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That's great.

736
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So the free you have to talk about issues,

737
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
not with ethics.

738
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
What do you make of podcasting?

739
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Make you think and make you smile.

740
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The Mr. Nice Guy show.

741
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
M-R-N-I-S-G-I-D-O-R-G.

742
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
The ready.

743
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
For those of you who've ever looked at my web log,

744
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
at curie.com www.curie.com.

745
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We have a person who comments very often.

746
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Just about every single day, it comes in spurts.

747
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's the comic strip blogger.

748
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And he writes the most obscene, outrageous stuff.

749
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And you know, a lot of people really despise him.

750
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I have to be very honest.

751
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I like it.

752
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I like it when he comes in with his comments,

753
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
because it stirs up stuff and people start posting.

754
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And I like it when people are fighting with words

755
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
back and forth.

756
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It's interesting to see.

757
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Because it's comic strip blogger.

758
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
He's nuts.

759
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
He doesn't give a shit about anybody says.

760
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And apparently, he's been the subject

761
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
of many a controversy on the internet.

762
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And he finally sent in an audio column.

763
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
He may have actually sent one before.

764
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't know if I ever played it.

765
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But he sent one in that I'd like to share with you today.

766
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Hello.

767
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Hello.

768
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Here is comics strip blogger.

769
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
No, no.

770
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Or so, as my wife owns a fan.

771
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I would like to wish you, okay.

772
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, soon.

773
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And by the way, I would like to remind you,

774
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and ask you kind of,

775
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
we should get on top of.

776
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Could you please ask,

777
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
management of series three mail here,

778
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
to enable streaming of

779
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
portfolio over internet.

780
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Forced to subscribe.

781
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So this is one of the main things he keeps yelling

782
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
that me about.

783
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
He's, he subscribes to series to listen to it through the website.

784
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So he doesn't even have a receiver,

785
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
because he lives, I think, in Germany.

786
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
He'll go on to tell us that in the rest of his comment.

787
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But he's been asking me to get the serious guys

788
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
to stream the channel.

789
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And the problem is, and of course,

790
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
have asked them comic strip blogger.

791
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Of course I have.

792
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The problem is they can only stream the whole channel or nothing.

793
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And they can't stream the whole channel because

794
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
there's a lot of,

795
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
differences in the way they adhere to the digital

796
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Millennium Copyright Act for their,

797
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
a full-time music channels and their talk channels.

798
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And there's some legal reason why they can't do that.

799
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But they've heard you request again,

800
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
then here on the show.

801
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I don't remember that.

802
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And also I'd say it's cyber.

803
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I had a, for a turn on subscription.

804
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And obviously, I can listen to the satellite radio

805
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
series over satellite.

806
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I can listen to it over internet online

807
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
because I'm not in the same.

808
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I, I, in Germany.

809
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I ask you very, very kind.

810
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I would show you the top of me.

811
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Please talk to that.

812
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And the range for Atlanta.

813
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And of course I will show you very well.

814
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm listening to your pop-up regularly.

815
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And get well soon, man.

816
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Hello.

817
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Is the most important thing in my life?

818
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Ah, how sweet he is, our comic strip blogger.

819
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Dude, so I've already asked, okay, I can't help you.

820
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That's some, it's some legal issue they have.

821
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The comic strip blogger, comic strip blogger.com,

822
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
is a great artist though.

823
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
He does these fantastic,

824
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
like three pain cartoons of daily events in technology,

825
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
blogger sphere, the potter sphere, if you will.

826
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And it's really something to check out.

827
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And he should do more of that.

828
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And he should actually, he should focus,

829
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
completely on that.

830
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I think that would be the best.

831
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah, I'm casting with Adam.

832
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Hey Adam, who are you ready to be stumps?

833
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Oh, I wish they used that.

834
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Fantastic.

835
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
With young projects.

836
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Hey Adam, I really miss doing the hit test for the daily source code.

837
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I hear you.

838
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But I understand why it's not possible anymore.

839
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Maybe something will change in future regulations regarding copyrighted stuff.

840
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And something will be possible.

841
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I just wanted to let you know that I created the next hit test podcast that is featuring a hit test.

842
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So it's available at youngpolets.com

843
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and through the RSS used for the hit test.

844
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So that's all.

845
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I enjoyed it a lot creating the hit test.

846
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I know you enjoyed them as well.

847
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Maybe until next time.

848
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
See you later.

849
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Bye-bye.

youngpolets.com

853
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and the OLDT.com

854
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Oh, young.

855
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I miss you, man.

856
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I miss the hit test.

857
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But, you know, since we went purely pod safe.

858
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Just can't do it anymore.

859
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So that was young's call.

860
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You can go check out the last hit test podcast at youngpolet.com

861
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
and he's working on something else.

862
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And I hear he's working on it with another well-known podcaster.

863
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Looking forward to what he's going to produce because young is a great producer.

864
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And I don't think he should limit himself at all to pod safe music.

865
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Okay, just briefly, since I do have to get out of here pretty soon.

866
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I have now learned that both the Gemma, the GEMA in Germany,

867
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and the Seicam in France, this SACM, both of them say.

868
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And these are the ASCAP BMI equivalent say that when you sign the contract with them,

869
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
you have signed over the performance rights to them.

870
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And indeed, according to their rules and regulations,

871
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
you then can no longer play that music pod safe.

872
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And I think that is an absolute outrage.

873
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We have confirmation from ASCAP BMI that it doesn't work that way in the States.

874
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
But to have that happening in now three countries, including the Netherlands,

875
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
is a travesty.

876
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
We've got to keep our eye on this and change that because that makes no sense.

877
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Last pod safe song for the day is the candy but you're...

878
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Man in Paris in 94.

879
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Oh, was it 95?

880
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
She was best studying abroad.

881
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
He was on tour, playing in another dime.

882
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
They potted hard and they potted wings.

883
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
A little north of the sand.

884
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
He dreamed about her in so many ways.

885
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
She dreamed about her in French.

886
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Well, she knows what to do with my call.

887
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
She knows how to make him feel.

888
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That is the one.

889
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
He's his mother's son, not like anyone.

890
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
He just needs time to heal.

891
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
They met him in New York a few months later.

892
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
He was still living alone.

893
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Hugging the ball and masturbating.

894
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Never answered his phone.

895
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
The first date was a movie together.

896
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Outside it Brian Pock.

897
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It was spirit of St. Louis just went on forever.

898
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So they drank wine until they saw stars.

899
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Well, she knows what to do with my call.

900
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
She knows how to make him feel.

901
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
That is the one.

902
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
He's his mother's son, not like anyone.

903
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It just needs time to heal.

904
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:47,000
They finally hooked up for the first time.

905
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
They finally hooked up for the first time.

906
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
The night before the Fourth of July.

907
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,000
He felt so awkward saying goodbye to the girl who just changed his life.

908
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Now my friend, they are in separate ball.

909
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
She even gets that boy to go to the gym.

910
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Now if you don't think that's love, you must be cynical.

911
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh, make a man, you're just dreaming in French.

912
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yeah, because she knows what to do with my call.

913
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
She knows how to make him feel.

914
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That is the one.

915
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
He's his mother's son, not like anyone.

916
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It just needs time to heal.

917
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Oh, she knows what to do with my call.

918
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
She knows how to make him feel.

919
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That is the one.

920
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
He's his mother's son, not like anyone.

921
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It just needs time to heal.

922
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah, he's the one.

923
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
He's his mother's son, not like anyone.

924
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It just needs time to heal.

925
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Well, that's right.

926
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
He just needs time to heal.

927
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What to do with my call, Candy Butchers?

928
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You can find three of their tracks at the Ponce Music Network at music.ponshow.com.

929
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That's it for the Daily Source Code for today.

930
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Check it out.

931
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
We'll see you tomorrow.

932
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Another pod show podcast.

933
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Stick it in your ear.
