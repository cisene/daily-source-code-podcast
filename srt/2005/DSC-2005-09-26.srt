00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Delta's here at Charley 2, 4, 6.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Monday, September 26th in the year of our Lord 2,5, good morning everybody.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Once again another beautiful day in Northern California, nice and sunny.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I just had my test, this is the big test that I've been waiting for,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
it's the insurance test.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
People who know me, know that I'm fine with everything except for one,

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
mine of detail, that would be needles.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I would make such a horrible junkie tell you.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So anyway, Patty from the insurance company came over this morning,

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
right in early.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I wasn't about to eat anything or only drink water.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In the whole nine yards, it was kind of like a flight medical,

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
where you get the full 12 lead EKG and take you blood pressure three times.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm a very healthy baby boy, 190 pounds, six foot, four and a half.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And I did not think.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
In fact, I didn't even feel the pain.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Actually, Christina's really, really sweet.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She knows that I'm bad.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am when it comes to needles.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I know I'm admitting it to being an incredible pussy right now.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She called me up and left me a beautiful voice mail saying,

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
don't worry dad, just pretend that I'm there because usually I take her along a whole night.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But Patty who came up and did this was great.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I didn't feel the freaking thing was fantastic.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Three, two is a blood.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Excellent.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, lots of cool stuff to play for you.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I decided not to go through the email and read emails instead.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I figured out that I'd play a lot of these audio feedback bits that I've been receiving.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, we got a couple of pieces of feedback about bio diesel and podcasting internationally.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We've got pod save music.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Also, young bullets hit test.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We'll show up.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hit test number 60 is back in the studio.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And art from mashuptown.com sent me over a wonderful mashup.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Just before it's about to get the show going.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, I was able to spot it in because I didn't have one.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is Fidelsky.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And you can find more info about it at mashuptown.com.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Feels like making La D'D'A.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mashed up on the source code.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You'll be this started already.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We like somebody.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We don't close.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We don't want somebody weird.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just someone that's on the line.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And when we're on the ball,

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
we're on the line.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But all the young keep me young.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And when we're on the line.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000

Just before it's about to get the show going.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The show's about to get the show going.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now that's a way to start our two weeks isn't it?

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And let's make it great week out of this.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Look at all the opportunities that lay ahead of you.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,180
that lay ahead of you.

135
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,540
Isn't this just a beautiful time to be alive?

136
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,020
Feel like La Dida, Dida, Dida.

137
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,680
A little bit of, what does that feel like making love?

138
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,180
Who's that again?

139
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,680
Is that bad company?

140
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,780
Who's not it?

141
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,860
This is the Daily Source Code.

142
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,100
I've been talking a lot about bio diesel.

143
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,300
I'm really serious about this stuff now.

144
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,420
The end of the year, I get rid of the Audi A8

145
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,940
and I'm looking at a number of different cars.

146
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,060
I've received so many emails about which car to buy,

147
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,980
which diesel to buy, where to get diesel.

148
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,860
How to create bio diesel, just phenomenal bits of information.

149
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,980
Lots of that started showing up on the wiki,

150
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,900
the show notes wiki, which I'm so in love with the concept

151
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,780
of using a wiki for show notes.

152
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,140
So wiki is basically collaborative writing environment.

153
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,780
And so I put one up for the Thursday show.

154
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,380
I'm sorry, the Thursday Saturday show was really the first one

155
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,540
that was utilized.

156
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,380
I didn't put it up.

157
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,420
There's two guys who have a company that create wiki

158
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,900
and they set up a daily source code.info.

159
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,060
Got my attention there, I'll tell you that.

160
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,180
And it was working, people were posting in different bits

161
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,740
about the show that I had done Saturday night,

162
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,780
the Saturday night special, a daily source code

163
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,340
in lieu of a Friday show.

164
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,780
And pictures were showing up.

165
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,540
And I could just see all the different edits

166
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,540
and it was fantastic.

167
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,420
And then all of a sudden, Sunday, this thing disappears.

168
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
It's gone.

169
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,380
And I've got like 404, so I got an email from the guys

170
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,620
and they said that they're working on it.

171
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,220
I guess, I don't know if it got hacked or if someone

172
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,060
something seems like something horrible went wrong,

173
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,060
which of course may be the entire downside of wiki show notes

174
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,300
is that it is an open and collaborative writing environment.

175
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,540
Anyone can come in and do anything.

176
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,740
But it was doing great.

177
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,940
So I'm hoping that the show notes for today

178
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,860
will also be able to appear in wiki form.

179
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,540
If these guys get the wiki back up and running,

180
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,900
I'm sure they will eventually.

181
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,060
I don't know if they'll have the data from Saturday night show

182
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,620
but man, it was really, really working.

183
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,380
And then there's all kinds of questions

184
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,460
that I have about Google and how it indexes wikis.

185
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,500
I would presume seeing the wiki PDF shows up

186
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,060
in lots of Google searches that I do that it will index properly.

187
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,140
And then wouldn't it be nice?

188
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,940
This is really cool.

189
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,300
I saw that you can pick up an RSS feed

190
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,420
for all the new entries on the wiki, which

191
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,100
is very cool.

192
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,740
The question is, can we also add an enclosure

193
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,820
to that RSS feed?

194
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,420
If we could do that, well, then we

195
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,100
might have a whole bunch of things in one,

196
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,540
they'll be very, very convenient.

197
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,540
Hey, yeah, Adam, this has been from the WAT weekly podcast.

198
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,020
You've been talking about biodiesel a lot lately

199
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,540
on the daily source code.

200
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,660
And it just so happens that my podcast talks exclusively

201
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,620
about energy and alternatives of energy

202
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,860
and thrown in there is some biodiesel stuff as well.

203
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,820
And actually in my last show, I was talking about

204
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,140
how the biodiesel market is just going to explode

205
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,300
in a couple of years because the U.S. is moving

206
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,700
to ultra-low self or diesel fuel.

207
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,820
I'm telling you this stuff really is going to explode.

208
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,540
These engines, originally, as far as I understand,

209
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,660
the diesel engine was made to run on vegetable oil

210
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,180
and any other crap you could throw at it.

211
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,980
And somehow, we migrated into a more petrochemical version

212
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,260
of diesel, and there's all kinds of pros

213
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,860
when it comes to petroleum-based diesel

214
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,020
mainly performance, I guess, because it has

215
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,380
higher octanes and it'll give you more power.

216
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,860
Who needs power?

217
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,540
I need power.

218
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,220
I just need to go from point A to point B.

219
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,140
And I just really want to do this on biodiesel.

220
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,620
I'm on this total kick, and I'm seeing more and more people.

221
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,100
You know, the electric cars, they're great.

222
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,620
The ethanol vehicles, they're great,

223
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,540
but the concept of dirty old castaway vegetable oil

224
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,940
that you pick up from the chip shop

225
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,700
or from the hamburger joint down the road,

226
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,140
that's very appealing to me.

227
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,300
This time next year, so in September 2006,

228
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,820
ultra-low self or diesel fuel is basically

229
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,740
the equivalent of taking the lead at a gasoline,

230
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,180
which happened a long time ago.

231
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,180
So it's a long time coming for diesel fuel,

232
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,380
but what it also means is that you're going to have

233
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,660
to add a lubricant to the ultra-low self

234
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,300
or diesel fuel, otherwise your engine will be happy.

235
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,060
And guess what one of the best lubricant is

236
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,020
for ultra-low self or diesel?

237
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,620
Biodiesel, by any chance?

238
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,780
But, but biodiesel, so around one to two percent biodiesel,

239
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,420
probably make it into a lot of the diesel fuel

240
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,100
that you buy in the US next year,

241
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,820
and there's a lot of diesel fuel being sold in the US,

242
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,500
which means that sales of biodiesel,

243
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,340
at least in the US will probably go from around 50 million gallons

244
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,700
a year, that's what's sold now,

245
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,700
to around 370 million gallons of biodiesel a year,

246
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,820
probably within the next two years.

247
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,700
So that's huge growth, that's 640 percent growth.

248
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,780
So I calculated that for my last podcast,

249
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,020
and that's where I put my money, biodiesel.

250
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,180
And that's where Willie Nelson has put some of his money, too.

251
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,620
He sells his own biodiesel brands called BioWilly.

252
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,940
Yeah.

253
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,100
Wait a minute.

254
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,420
The guy who wrote crazy,

255
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,060
Willie Nelson couldn't come with anything better

256
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,740
than BioWilly, that was the most creative we could get.

257
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,540
And then, although there just goes to show,

258
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,020
Willie's into it, so there's got to be something good.

259
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,620
When Willie Nelson is doing something like smoking

260
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,740
joints in the White House, then you got to think

261
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,860
he's onto something good.

262
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,700
So BioWilly, I wonder, can you get that anyway?

263
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,620
I'm probably doing in Texas.

264
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,540
In some parts of Texas, and he's also got location

265
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,060
in Southern California and South Carolina.

266
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,300
So anyway, I just thought that everybody

267
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,380
know what's going on in the biodiesel world,

268
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,180
check out my podcast, The What's Weekly Podcast,

269
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,620
which you can download by going to my website,

270
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,700
TheWat.com, that's THEWATT.com,

271
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,500
or we're also in the iTunes directory search

272
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,340
for The What's THEWATT all one word.

273
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,300
Thank you very much, he's been Kennedy.

274
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,500
Subscribe, dude, totally subscribe.

275
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,420
I'm so into this.

276
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,860
I think it's the Mad Max vibe of it

277
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,820
that appeals the most, where there's no more,

278
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,420
you know, the premise behind Mad Max,

279
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,500
there's no more petrol, no more petroleum, everyone's

280
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,620
it's almost like a water world as well.

281
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,660
You know, where that everything's alternative energy,

282
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,540
except for the guys who have fuel and they're basically

283
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,060
the pirates and they rule everything.

284
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,060
And I like the idea of just having grungy barrels of oil.

285
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,780
You know, no matter what happens, I can always grow more.

286
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,940
You know what's going to happen, though?

287
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,540
Here's the thing that's going to go wrong,

288
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,420
because these things, the biodiesel gets a little too,

289
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,580
isn't liquid enough, really during the winter.

290
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,100
It starts to gel up and so you have to either pre-heat

291
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,740
or you have to start your car on regular diesel.

292
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,060
And I can just envision, we're going to have this great car.

293
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,820
I think it's either going to be a Mercedes or Volkswagen,

294
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,740
both have diesels that will take biodiesel,

295
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
but I don't like Mercedes-Benz.

296
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,820
I don't like the way they drive.

297
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,460
They feel so tankish and heavy.

298
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,300
And so it'll probably be a VW.

299
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,780
They have some nice cars these days, by the way.

300
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,300
Was the Faiton or whatever?

301
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,260
That's a massive car.

302
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,180
And they also have a diesel version of that.

303
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,140
So you know what's going to happen,

304
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,620
and it's going to be one cold morning,

305
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,060
and Patricia's going to need the car.

306
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,260
Fuck, it's not going to start.

307
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,100
She's going to hate me for it.

308
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,060
Hello, I'm Jürgen Schlund,

309
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,820
and in my podcast, from the podcast Cafe,

310
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,460
I'd like to talk about the best music

311
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
from the podcast music portal.

312
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,220
The interesting information

313
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,620
about the artists, news,

314
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,220
about the project music,

315
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,620
the interesting sites,

316
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,500
and of course, one or the other message.

317
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,820
And that's all about VW,

318
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,740
podcastkaffee.de.

319
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,780
We'll see you next time.

320
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,340
Hi Adam, my name is Erno.

321
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,580
I'm a French guy living in San Francisco,

322
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,500
Barry, and I'm working for Apple Computer.

323
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,340
Maybe I'll see you when you come over.

324
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,540
I'll be the very wearing dude walking around on the campus

325
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,820
with a baguette and an iPod.

326
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,340
Anyway, I've been thinking of going

327
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,260
to a little brainwashing, sounds, done thing,

328
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,140
find a deeply flawed.

329
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,380
What if you go sensitive?

330
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,780
And I happen to be in Paris,

331
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,020
one of my favorite cities in the world,

332
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,460
stepping on fresh, steaming, duck shit, what then Adam?

333
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,780
He would ruin the San sail brand for me.

334
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,740
Every time I see pieces done, I think,

335
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,780
since there goes your brand plan

336
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,180
for brainwashing us, podcasting, listening,

337
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,340
lemons.

338
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,300
You may control what I stick into my ear,

339
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,340
but you don't control my environment yet, Adam.

340
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,180
Got it?

341
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
You happen to have a sailboat,

342
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,060
but just don't let me do it.

343
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,300
Hey, hey, you catch a bloke,

344
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,140
just let me do that.

345
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,820
Demonstrate this to you, concretely, Adam.

346
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,580
You gotta give some direction to your listeners

347
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,500
if you want this thing to work.

348
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,100
All right, people.

349
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,300
That goes for you too, Adam.

350
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,180
Look around you and find something,

351
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,260
somewhat repulsive, a disgusting.

352
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,660
I don't know, grease stain on your desk,

353
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,700
a cockroach and a kitchen.

354
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,860
I got some mold between the thousand, the shower,

355
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,100
your roommate threw up in the kitchen.

356
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,700
Good, good, good, look at that vomit.

357
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,540
Oh, nice.

358
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,300
Look at it intensely, even though it repelses you.

359
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,140
Ready?

360
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,980
Okay.

361
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,660
All right.

362
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,180
Call Robe.

363
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,500
There.

364
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,980
Anyway, love you, show.

365
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,580
Mine is a heartily amateurish podcast

366
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,140
in French.

367
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,540
Done from my home in Mendel Park,

368
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,300
Silicon Valley, California.

369
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,620
The website is SiliconValleyFrogs.com.

370
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,060
It addresses the French language audience.

371
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,460
It's about living in Silicon Valley, gadgets,

372
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,020
pop culture, all that.

373
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,660
Ready, they're from 70, fellow tour,

374
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,580
SiliconValleyFrogs.com.

375
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,100
So iTunes, say, digro-nood, don't have any.

376
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,140
All right, Adam.

377
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,340
Thanks for letting me make that shameless plug back to you

378
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,220
and get that cooking oil, car cooking.

379
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,060
You know what I mean?

380
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
Thanks, Adam.

381
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Put.

382
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
Merci beaucoup.

383
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,100
I don't know.

384
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,420
We are bad and international.

385
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,100
Actually, I'm going to be looking for you,

386
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,780
Bury, Wearing Guy with a Baggett and an iPod.

387
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,060
We're actually going to Apple today.

388
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
We have a meeting.

389
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,900
And yes, I have all your comments under my arm.

390
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Although I'm pretty sure they know they're very aware of them.

391
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,620
So looking forward to that.

392
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,820
It's going to be kind of interesting week.

393
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,660
We have a whole bunch of candidates coming in candidates.

394
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,020
We're looking, obviously, to hire people.

395
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,460
You've probably heard the job cast a couple weeks ago here on the daily source code.

396
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,540
And we have, I think, two applicants each day.

397
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:44,620
And these are for, you know, high-end engineers, system architects, rock stars.

398
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Let's call it that.

399
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,620
And boy, we got a couple of them coming in.

400
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,780
Some of them even had sent in their CV as a CV cast on an MP3.

401
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,540
So I'm very excited about that.

402
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,340
That's, of course, one of the main reasons that we hear in Silicon Valley is, you know,

403
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,500
we got, had all the media stuff down.

404
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:06,740
But never did we see the perfect meld and mesh of media and technology with user created

405
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
media, by the way.

406
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,220
So that's the smartest users there are when I'm talking about Hollywood.

407
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,620
And it's always been that tech companies have set up shop in Hollywood and have tried

408
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
to integrate that way.

409
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,580
I think that, well, usually I found, whenever you do something exactly the opposite

410
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,100
wave of the way the status quo is and the way people are doing it, usually it's the right

411
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
way.

412
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,500
It turned out to be really successful with that.

413
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,020
I got some music here from the Podsafe music network.

414
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,020
This one is in the top hot place.

415
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,300
I know it played, I think Sally went down by Matthew Ebo.

416
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,580
But this is another one I like a lot.

417
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,660
It's called Drive Away.

418
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,180
We're in that maybe little escape, what we need.

419
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,420
We love and you work like a dog every morning.

420
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:14,460
The city's paying like the latte's staying on your dress, hitting the band before you

421
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,860
raked down and don't cost the down to leave this town, we don't the road because we got

422
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:35,020
against this mess, so let's drive away, let's celebrate Jesus all day, I'm done

423
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:50,020
going to stay in a way, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away.

424
00:18:50,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive

425
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,020
away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive

426
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:31,020
away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive away, let's drive

427
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:41,020
You're saying in a way, let's drive away.

428
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:09,020
Sorry, but I seem fast, but I gotta get going.

429
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:15,020
It's gotta be more than the coffee shops in the bar.

430
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:21,020
Lady, maybe it's due. Lady, maybe it's just me.

431
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:31,020
Maybe you take my hand again, but I don't know if it's time to drive away.

432
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,020
It's so nice, so so nice.

433
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Maybe that's all I got to say.

434
00:20:42,020 --> 00:21:03,020
We'll drive away.

435
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:12,020
It's the magic.

436
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:21,020
Drive it into that morning sun.

437
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:31,020
You can check the show notes when they're up on the weekend notes.

438
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,020
We've got a couple other great songs there.

439
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:47,020
There's a new song that came in and it's unbelievable.

440
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:52,020
This is good too.

441
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:00,020
There's a new show, I think it debuts today and it's the Podsafe music review.

442
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:11,020
It's pieces of all of the Podsafe music shows that are playing Podsafe music.

443
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:21,020
I think it debuts today, check out accident hash to find out more.

444
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:27,020
This is your daily source code, Monday the 26th of September, almost finishing out the month,

445
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,020
which means I'm going to go back to see my girls looking forward to that very much.

446
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:37,020
I think Christina wants to start doing some pod casts.

447
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,020
She's kind of hinting at it, so I think what I'll do is I'll engineer it for.

448
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:49,020
Pretty much I think Michael Butler engineers and Martina's Emogirl talk pod cast, so that should be fun.

449
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,020
And she misses me too.

450
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,020
So then I was just saying called the teen pod casters network and it's growing.

451
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:05,020
I've always wondered what the, I think the typical age range that I'm hearing people on pod casts,

452
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,020
responding to pod casts, skews a little bit older, definitely 18 plus.

453
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,020
But now the teen pod casters network and I used to check it out teen pod casters network.com.

454
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,020
It's growing and there's a lot going on there.

455
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Yeah, he's a promo from shooting.

456
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,020
Hey, shoot man, it's me.

457
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,020
Shoot me.

458
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,020
It's my power here.

459
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,020
What the heck, man?

460
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
I'm not kidding.

461
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
If we must add to the beat.

462
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
I have an accent that's going to show you.

463
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Shoot me.

464
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,020
Shoot me.

465
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
Shoot me.

466
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Hey, you've reached the shooting show.

467
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Which can be found at shibisho.com.

468
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,020
The shibisho is a podcast done by a 14-year-old me, shibis.

469
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:56,020
Let me talk about life stuff that's happening and my views on it.

470
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,020
And I also go over stuff that's interesting, grand effects.

471
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,020
I debunk over legends and stuff like that.

472
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,020
Sometimes I get my friends on like nebio.

473
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
Say hi nebio.

474
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
Hey, what's up?

475
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
All right.

476
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,020
Hey, stop me.

477
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
And I'm gonna shoot my little brother.

478
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,020
Hello.

479
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:21,020
So, go over and check out the shibisho at shibisho.com.

480
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,020
If you want to get inside a teen's head.

481
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
The shibisho is a pro.

482
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Member of the teen podcast is network which can be found at

483
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,020
teenpodcasters.com.

484
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Hey, out of my name's Michael Smith.

485
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
And Barry Mandinger.

486
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,020
We run a podcast called In the Cube.

487
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
In the film cast.

488
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,020
News reviews and interviews from around the world.

489
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,020
And a whole lot more.

490
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,020
It's all to do with independent film.

491
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,020
And we've had a couple of people give us a bit of a plug.

492
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
Uh, in the cube is in the know.

493
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,020
So, an online blog with news reviews and interviews.

494
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,020
www.inthecube.com.au.

495
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,020
So, Michael, who was that mystery man?

496
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Mr Hugo Weaving.

497
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
Not the Hugo Weaving?

498
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Yes, agent Smith from the Matrix.

499
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Wow.

500
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Remember, we're in the cube.

501
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:31,020
The indie film cast at www.inthecube.com.au.

502
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Check us out.

503
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
Thanks, mates.

504
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
In the cube.

505
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
I went to Australia.

506
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
A number of years ago.

507
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
I did a documentary.

508
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Went from Sydney to Melbourne from Melbourne all the way across to Perth.

509
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,020
The western side of Australia.

510
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,020
On the way, visited Cooper PD, which is where the Opalmines are.

511
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,020
That was a very wild west type saloon ghost town kind of vibe there.

512
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,020
That was pretty creepy.

513
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
There's holes everywhere.

514
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,020
Everywhere.

515
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
There's a hole where someone has dug a mine.

516
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,020
There's a claim office.

517
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
There's signs everywhere saying,

518
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,020
If you're a tourist, do not take pictures and walk backwards.

519
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,020
Because you have a good chance of falling in a fricking hole.

520
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
We went to William's Creek.

521
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,020
The smallest town in Australia.

522
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,020
A tour is attraction.

523
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,020
You really have to...

524
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,020
It's quite a trek out.

525
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
We went with the mail truck.

526
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
It's also a commercial ride.

527
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,020
You pay a couple hundred bucks to go on the mail truck tour.

528
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,020
You go straight through the Outback.

529
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,020
We slept in the Outback.

530
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,020
I went to...

531
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,020
How that was horrible.

532
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,020
Went to Rooshooting, kangaroo shooting.

533
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,020
There's so many kangaroos.

534
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,020
There's like a hundred million kangaroos versus 40 million people.

535
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,020
So they have to quote harvest the kangaroos.

536
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,020
These suckers are like six feet tall.

537
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
They had some of them taller than that.

538
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
The god at night.

539
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,020
It's really sad when we document all this.

540
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,020
They shine a huge search light onto a pack of kangaroos.

541
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,020
And invariably a couple will just go like don't like deer caught in the headlights.

542
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Because they have really small heads compared to their bodies.

543
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,020
I don't know how much thought process there is in there.

544
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,020
And then the guy puts a bullet right through his eyes.

545
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,020
And they're very careful and they always hit on the first go.

546
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,020
And they always kill him immediately.

547
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,020
Like that's how he sawless.

548
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,020
And the reason why is not out of humanity.

549
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
But the bullets cost like a buck up piece.

550
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
They really told me that.

551
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,020
And then adds really just disgusting.

552
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Then they hang the male kangaroos.

553
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,020
They don't shoot female kangaroos if they certainly not if they have youngins.

554
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,020
But really they go after the males.

555
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,020
And then they time up by his testicles and winch him up.

556
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,020
And they'll have like 30 or 40 of these suckers on their truck at the end of the day.

557
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,020
And they get money for each one they harvest.

558
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,020
Anyway, so that was one part of the trip.

559
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,020
The fun part was the bachelor and spinster's ball.

560
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
You should Google that.

561
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:06,020
If you ever go to Australia, you have to go to a spinster's and bachelor's ball, I think it is.

562
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,020
And the kids basically get in their youths.

563
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,020
That's their utility vehicles.

564
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,020
Kind of like flatbed pick up trucks with tremendously tuned engines in the front.

565
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
They buck the youths.

566
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
They bark them by revving them up.

567
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
And then they have a really high pitch sound.

568
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,020
And the party usually lasts over the weekend.

569
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
And there's a huge tent.

570
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,020
And when you come into the tent, you park a youth around it.

571
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
That's where you have your swag.

572
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,020
That's what you sleep in.

573
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,020
It's kind of like here.

574
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:36,020
This really big sleeping outdoor type sleeping bag slash sleeping mat combination.

575
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,020
And you get a cup tied to your neck.

576
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
And that's your cup for the whole weekend.

577
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,020
And they just pour the, you pay once and everything is just the booze just keeps on flow.

578
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,020
So basically all you do is drink all weekend and have sex in your swag.

579
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
And then mess around the mud.

580
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
It's awesome.

581
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
I'm telling you, Australia, they work hard.

582
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,020
And they also play hard.

583
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Yeah.

584
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
You really are this stuff your fog on you.

585
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
Yeah.

586
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
Yeah.

587
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Have you been?

588
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:10,020
You could not be more wrong about this whole thing with international implications of podcasting.

589
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Okay.

590
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,020
I think what Curtis talking about here is where I said that the, that podcast and was growing

591
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:21,020
at such an astronomical rate in the United States because the radio here has really been packaged

592
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,020
down to something so unexciting.

593
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,020
And in other countries, it just isn't growing as fast.

594
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
And some it is.

595
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,020
And I think it's probably he's going to make mention that I said that in the UK, we sure we have over

596
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,020
100 podcasters.

597
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,020
But it's not growing that fast because we do have some great radio being made in the United Kingdom.

598
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,020
Other parts of the world have more interesting radio than the United States.

599
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,020
Give me a part.

600
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,020
Have you ever listened to Japanese radio?

601
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,020
No.

602
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
Chinese radio?

603
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,020
No.

604
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
No.

605
00:29:54,020 --> 00:30:02,020
I do know that the Chinese marketplace is now becoming the, I think all the radio guys are moving in there.

606
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,020
Murdoch is moving in there.

607
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,020
They're all getting terrestrial licenses.

608
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:11,020
So it'll be interesting to see because China is also a very unwired country for data transmission.

609
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:18,020
So the lines really could blur for them between what is a radio transmission of radio audio or what

610
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:23,020
is a radio transmission coming through a cell phone or some other wired device, wired wireless device.

611
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
So yeah, that's an interesting point.

612
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,020
Well, you know about to the Chinese is the second largest radio market in the world right now.

613
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,020
It's also the fastest growing MP3 market.

614
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,020
Yeah.

615
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Isn't China just the biggest market period for anything?

616
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:45,020
No matter what you say, if you said fastest growing market for toothbrushes, China.

617
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,020
I think they would wait every single time.

618
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Lemon radio, lame, French radio, lame.

619
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Okay, yeah, I mean, you've got some good radio.

620
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:04,020
There's some quality there, but in terms of quality, what you've got here is a three BBC stations.

621
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,020
I think it's five additional public stations.

622
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
Yeah, but hold on a second.

623
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,020
You have to understand it's not just about the number of stations.

624
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,020
It's about what's going on there.

625
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:19,020
And I have to say the BBC are very, very free in what people can do there on the radio.

626
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
It just hasn't been this package.

627
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,020
Look, look at the consolidation that's going on for the past couple of years in radio with companies like clear

628
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,020
channel buying up, you know, up to close up to what they must have at least 2,000 radio stations.

629
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:36,020
That's the final breath for foreign industry is consolidation.

630
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
So it was time here.

631
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
That hasn't happened in many other countries.

632
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Nationwide, I believe about a dozen molecular regional stations.

633
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,020
Come on, let's not variety.

634
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,020
You can't possibly look at the variety of podcasts programming available.

635
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,020
And really think that people outside of the United States don't want it.

636
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
They're being the world traveler you are.

637
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,020
I wouldn't thought you were a little more savvy to international implications of this business.

638
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
Go back and look at the data points.

639
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
All right.

640
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
All right.

641
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
All right.

642
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
All right.

643
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
I'll show pitch dot blog spot.com.

644
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
I don't know what's at the big picture.

645
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
There we go.

646
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
Thank you.

647
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
I'll definitely check that out.

648
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,020
His comment went on for another three to half minutes.

649
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,020
I decided to break it off at the Andy kind of winds up saying,

650
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Hey, let's work together because he knows a lot about the foreign markets.

651
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,020
Totally.

652
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
Of course, the foreign markets are going to happen.

653
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,020
This is also something.

654
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,020
It's not just a replacement of something, something completely news.

655
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,020
Obviously, obviously it's going to grow.

656
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,020
And it's going to look, of course, we're hearing from Germany and from Australia.

657
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:43,020
And I actually saw a couple of French podcasts pop up by coincidence on any

658
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Potter dot org the other day.

659
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
So stuff is definitely happening.

660
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,020
But it's just rampant here in the States.

661
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,020
That was a great podcast.

662
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,020
I was listening to over the weekend Pacific Coast Hellway.

663
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,020
This guy is good.

664
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,020
He does a podcast on his way to work every single morning.

665
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,020
And I guess he records pieces of it.

666
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,020
And he must do some post editing.

667
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,020
If not, he's got a great mobile set up.

668
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
And he's funny, man.

669
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,020
He is, in fact, that a very Howard Stern asked moment or experience.

670
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,020
I mean, I was, when I lived in New York and I was commuting into this or a new jersey

671
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,020
and commuting to the city every day, always would listen to Stern.

672
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,020
You know, even the best of repeats we'd listen to.

673
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,020
And sometimes you get sick of it and wouldn't listen to it for a week or two.

674
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,020
And then you'd invariably always come back.

675
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,020
And I was such a big fan.

676
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,020
I remember whenever Howard Stern would talk about me on the air,

677
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,020
he would always say, I was a dick.

678
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,020
And it hurt because I was such a fan of the show.

679
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,020
And so I'm listening to this Pacific Coast Hellway.

680
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:51,020
Andrew Grummit, developer for iPod 11, turned me on to it.

681
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,020
And he played one show, which was pretty funny.

682
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,020
And so then I subscribed to the podcast and I've been listening.

683
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,020
And all of a sudden I hear this guy say, Adam Curry, that big-haired fact.

684
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,020
I was like, it was the same thing.

685
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,020
He was like, oh man, I'm such a fan of the show.

686
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,020
And well, to be honest, he's an equal opportunity offender.

687
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
He definitely slams everybody.

688
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,020
I'm not for the week at heart.

689
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
I guess that podcast.

690
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,020
But I love it, though, because it is.

691
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,020
It's the guys a great writer.

692
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
And he's got bits on there.

693
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,020
Check it out at Pacific Coast Hellway.com.

694
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
Hi there, Daley source code listeners.

695
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,020
This is Frank Senate, host of the alternative source podcast.

696
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,020
Available at alternative source radio.com.

697
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,020
And through iTunes, if you search alternative source or Frank Senate.

698
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:54,020
And I've been paying a lot of attention to the mainstream media lately, because they can't stop congratulating themselves for finally sprouting a spine and confronting government officials over the mess they made of hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.

699
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Well, guess what?

700
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,020
The nation's alternative press holds officials accountable week after week on issue after issue.

701
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,020
There's no need for backslapping.

702
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
They know it's their job.

703
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:08,020
And as a bonus, alternative weeklys are often far ahead of the curve on cultural trends.

704
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,020
For instance, on our show, you might hear about butt bleaching.

705
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,020
The fashion east is at LA Psycho Girlfriend, reverse shop lifting,

706
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,020
underwear dance parties, and even pot head softball stars.

707
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,020
In under five minutes a week, the alternative source surveys these hot news stories and cultural trends.

708
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,020
So you can hear where the mainstream media will be in six months.

709
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,020
If ever, and if they ever stop patting themselves on the back.

710
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,020
So check out the alternative source at alternative source radio.com

711
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,020
or an iTunes under Frank Senate or alternative source.

712
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,020
That's the source for the source.

713
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:51,020
The motortools went forth and cast their pods in the direction of all who would listen.

714
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,020
And casting their pods in this manner, they were henceforth known as pod castors.

715
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,020
I've got your podcast right here.

716
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,020
She's a girl and we've got a bottle.

717
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,020
A guy, a girl and a bottle is a weekly internet radio show for people to

718
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,020
interested in listening to an innovative wine podcast from a pair of novice wine reviewers.

719
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:23,020
Join us as we visit and review both the wineries and their wines in and around Silicon Valley.

720
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:32,020
You can find us in the podcast area of iTunes or on the web at www.gngb.com.

721
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,020
It reminds me Saturday night we did.

722
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
I should do that more often.

723
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,020
The Saturday night special, just a source code.

724
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,020
We play a little bit of music.

725
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,020
Man, I so wish we could play back catalog older songs from the 80s.

726
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
I really would love to do an 80 show.

727
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,020
Oh man, there's so much good music.

728
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,020
I've been messing around with my iTunes.

729
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:58,020
I don't have any other source of sound or video in the condo other than the power book.

730
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,020
So I have no TV and I have no radio.

731
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,020
We go to the sending me over a serious receiver though.

732
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,020
How was I going to say?

733
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:13,020
Oh yeah, I was thinking, we've talked to all these different record executives.

734
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,020
There are a few of them who are in the position to really have a legacy.

735
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,020
Here's what it would be.

736
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,020
If you're in the record business, I make sure you pull your lawyer in so we can listen to

737
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,020
because he'll also be legendary.

738
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,020
If you make a statement and allow podcasts, there's under certain parameters.

739
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:37,020
Let's say you can't create an end to end play list of songs.

740
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,020
It has to be spoken word in it.

741
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,020
If you let us play back catalog, hey, I'll pay extra for it.

742
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,020
Just put a little thing there and iTunes Steve Jobs.

743
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,020
He has a great way for you to start working with the record industry.

744
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,020
They want more money per track sold on iTunes.

745
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
They want more than 99 cents.

746
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,020
I know why you don't.

747
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,020
That's a part of your product.

748
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,020
And now they're talking about wanting some of the revenues.

749
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Screw that.

750
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Here's how we do it.

751
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,020
You put in iTunes.

752
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,020
Songs that the record companies chose and that they'll allow you to play on a podcast.

753
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,020
Let's say they can't play.

754
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,020
Well, maybe they'll just put a star next to everything.

755
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,020
A little green star, which means you can play it on your podcast.

756
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
And when you buy it, it costs five bucks.

757
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,020
It doesn't matter.

758
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
You tell me what it has to be.

759
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
That's as good as a CD almost.

760
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:34,020
But I guarantee you people buy tracks based upon what they hear in podcasts.

761
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,020
We've proven it over and over again.

762
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,020
And people are not seeing they're trying to filter me out and get,

763
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,020
listen to the compression I've got on the show.

764
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,020
No one in the right mind would try to steal a song for this one.

765
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,020
It's just like the radio treated that way.

766
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
Do that.

767
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,020
Then we'll all sign up for our ask cap and BMI fees.

768
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,020
And then we'll be done with it and you watch.

769
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,020
You can be legendary.

770
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,020
I'm not kidding you on this.

771
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,020
That will be your legacy is that you really kick started the digital music

772
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:10,020
Revolution by allowing license music to be planned podcasts.

773
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Okay.

774
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
We'll just note the day in the time that I said this.

775
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,020
By the way, it's 10 after 11 here.

776
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,020
Fantastic.

777
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,020
With Adam Curry.

778
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,020
I suppose you think you know where it is.

779
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,020
I should do.

780
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,020
What do you hear?

781
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,020
The hit test.

782
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,020
Young ballads.

783
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,020
Young ballads.

784
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
Hey, Adam.

785
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
This is artist number 60.

786
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,020
And it's the first one without the notebook.

787
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,020
So I'm in the studio with the professional mic and the sound processing as you can hear.

788
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,020
Sounds great.

789
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,020
But as always, three in throws and three answers.

790
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:51,020
And this is in throw number one.

791
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Legendary Duran Duran.

792
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Good for good girls on film.

793
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,020
Are they all going to be that easy, young?

794
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:07,020
And this is number two.

795
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,020
Okay.

796
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,020
I guess they're not all bad either.

797
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,020
And the final one is number three.

798
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,020
I know that one.

799
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,020
That's good.

800
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,020
That's good.

801
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,020
Jackson's playing it on the bookie by the A.

802
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,020
And times up and they were pretty easy.

803
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,020
This is answer number one.

804
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,020
And hit test number 60.

805
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,020
It's Duran Duran.

806
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,020
This is Girls on Film.

807
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,020
Still walking and in hand across the bridge and midnight.

808
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,020
I've done it for life, especially now it's all right.

809
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,020
Now I'm alone.

810
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
So we'll stay long.

811
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
Now I'm alone.

812
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,020
Now I'm alone.

813
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,020
Duran Duran is answer number one.

814
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,020
Girls on film.

815
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,020
And this is answer number two.

816
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,020
It's Gwen McCray.

817
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,020
Oh, man.

818
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
The lion's here.

819
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Hit the five.

820
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,020
He's burning.

821
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,020
Hit the barrel in hot.

822
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,020
Hit the barrel in hot.

823
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
We're going to love this.

824
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,020
Yeah.

825
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,020
You gotta give it all you got.

826
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,020
Oh, man.

827
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,020
And a lot of times searching for love.

828
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,020
And never know where it's coming from.

829
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,020
And as soon as we get it,

830
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Just look at some arms.

831
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,020
You still could think that I worked on.

832
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
So I'm burning.

833
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,020
Keep the fire burning.

834
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,020
Keep the barrel in hot.

835
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,020
Oh.

836
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
You gotta know I don't know.

837
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,020
Oh, man.

838
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,020
Yeah.

839
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,020
You gotta give it all you got.

840
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,020
And answer number two in this hit us.

841
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Keep the fire burning.

842
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Gwen McCray.

843
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,020
And this is the third and final answer in today's hit us.

844
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,020
The Jackson Five.

845
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,020
That's just blame it on the book.

846
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Baby's always missing.

847
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
And when is the old dark thing?

848
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,020
But I don't get no loveings.

849
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,020
And that's no love.

850
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,020
We spend the night in the disco.

851
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,020
And every can of disco.

852
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,020
From that night, I can't stop them.

853
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
Bye.

854
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,020
You're living such a shit.

855
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,020
Don't play more than moonlight.

856
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,020
Don't play more than moonlight.

857
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,020
Don't play no sunshine.

858
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,020
Don't take more than moonlight.

859
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,020
I don't play no good times.

860
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,020
Play more than book.

861
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,020
The Jackson Five.

862
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,520
and sing some number three in today's hit-test.

863
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,020
Blame it on the boogie!

864
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,520
As always, I selected some good music for the hit-test at least I think so, and that is the most important of course.

865
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,020
Okay, well this concludes hit-test number 60.

866
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,520
As I said earlier, from the studio here back home with the equipment and the professional mic.

867
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,020
See, they're everybody.

868
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,020
And recording a hit-test like this feels different.

869
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,020
But of course the production values are much higher, so it's a good thing I guess.

870
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,020
Okay, well, as always, feedback is welcome at hit-test at gmail.com.

871
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,520
And you can find info on my blog about the hit-test and the hit-test podcast.

872
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,020
It's yompulet.com, J-A-N-P-O-L-E-T dot com.

873
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,020
And I guess there will be a hit-test podcast soon as well.

874
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,020
There have been some developments you can read about them on the blog.

875
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:58,020
And if there's time and opportunity I will create a hit-test podcast soon.

876
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,020
Well, thank you for listening.

877
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,020
Hit-test 61 is end-making, so on the way.

878
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,020
So until then, bye-bye.

879
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,020
All right, yom, thank you very much.

880
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,020
Most excellent.

881
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
I keep the fire burn and that was great, man.

882
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,020
That was absolutely classic.

883
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,020
Oh, man, forgot all about that one.

884
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,020
Okay, one more pod save song before I get out of here.

885
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:24,020
You could tell I'm practicing trying to get up to my 49 minutes cycle, so we can, uh,

886
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,020
Simal podcast these shows on series.

887
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,020
See, see, Chapman sent me this one.

888
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,020
We said, if you want to know about emo, check these guys out.

889
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,020
Brunswick letters never send from the pod save music network.

890
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,020
If it's not in the snow, catch up it when it's a go.

891
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:48,020
If it was me, you know, they'll love secrets.

892
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,020
But not if I saw you.

893
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,020
But now I've got my time.

894
00:44:54,020 --> 00:45:00,020
You're meeting for this night to be a home fair.

895
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:08,020
And I can't find the best to go on.

896
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,020
We're living now, you said.

897
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,020
Go, you little guy can't be your partner.

898
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,020
Let it all out.

899
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,020
We're living now, you said.

900
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,020
Go, you little guy can't be your partner.

901
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,020
I'm all the same, you tried to get up all night.

902
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
It's so sour, my time is.

903
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,020
Has nickrpled to my knees.

904
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,020
My mouth's jam stops getting a long, re-trip.

905
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,020
I'll shine a light that goes by name.

906
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,020
Now, my friends, it was again.

907
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,020
I miss you all the evening.

908
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:11,020
So, they're high.

909
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:17,020
And I can't find the best to go on.

910
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,020
We're living now, you were there.

911
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,020
Better than you said.

912
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,020
Go! You little guy can't be your partner.

913
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,020
We're living now, you said.

914
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,020
Go, you little boy can't be your partner.

915
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,020
We're living now, you're there.

916
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,020
Check on my knees all the way home if there's deaths.

917
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,020
There's still no sort of way down.

918
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,020
No time, wait down

919
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,020
This song's not waged up

920
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,020
This night is waged up

921
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,020
This song's not waged up

922
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,020
This dream's not waged up

923
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,020
This day's not waged up

924
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,020
The song's not waged up

925
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:21,020
Well come to the yellow line

926
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:27,020
To help you not have a sun day

927
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,020
Let us ever send

928
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,020
But don't feel it, I can't feel it

929
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:40,020
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back

930
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,020
That day's not waged up

931
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,020
It's not waged up

932
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,020
There's no new days

933
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:52,020
But don't feel it, I can't feel it

934
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:58,020
For nothing

935
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,020
For nothing

936
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,020
From the album told in photographs, Brownswick

937
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:15,340
Graphs, Brunswick, letters never sent from the pod safe music network. I kind of rocked in the whole

938
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:20,460
recent CC sent me that track is because he heard me talking about the podcast that Michael

939
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:26,860
Butler's daughter Martina did with my daughter Christina on the Martina's podcast Emo Girl

940
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:31,420
talk and I heard a whole bunch of band names that had never heard it before and of course I've

941
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,860
heard some Emo stuff but this is cool and this is a real movement going on here.

942
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:42,620
Okay, I'm out of here. If you want to hear more new podcasts to listen to and other

943
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,220
worthless bansher about crapping in your tank to make your diesel engine run come again tomorrow

944
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,620
