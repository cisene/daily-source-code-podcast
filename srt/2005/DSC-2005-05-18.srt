1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay everyone, quiet everyone, simmer down, simmer down, but just want to say thank you for all the hard work you've done.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We couldn't have done it without you.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, quiet, static check, light, free, sound, sound, boom man, ready?

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is that a good position?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ready? Okay, 10 seconds people.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's do this right.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Five, four, three, two, cue music, lights up.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to show you the greatest thing your eyes have ever been held.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He was a king and a guard.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In the world he knew, but now he comes to civilization, merely a captain, a show to benefit your curiosity.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the eighth wonder of the world.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm testing this.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, DJ, are you done, next radio?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, that was supposed to be Adam Curry.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing? Welcome to the Humdadish, Nick the source code.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I know this also didn't put a date stamp on the show for today, but that's okay.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Because I think I'm just going to start doing show segments, numbers, sequential numbers.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So let's say this is shoot, what is this going to be?

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know, I haven't counted.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe this is, let's just start somewhere.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's say this is show number 250.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Welcome to the daily source code.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It is a Wednesday in Guilford, overcast, not very nice today.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A little bit warmer than yesterday.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Sitting here in the cottage, bringing you the daily source code with plenty of promos,

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
pot-safe music, of course.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've got a mashup for you.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And the pot cast I've been listening to, but I want to share with you.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And a couple of emails.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I've got to kind of hurry up today.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm on a tight schedule.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's one o'clock now.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Grunge meantime.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have a meeting with Lee Wilkins,

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a three o'clock at Starbucks.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Member Will, and his dogs, remember them?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That was truly one of the greatest moments in the beginning of podcasting

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
when Lee Wilkins created this podcast with his girlfriend,

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
his wife, I think, Jenny, and their dogs.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now he had a job in the States, went over there with his, with their two dogs

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and it didn't work out and he had to move back after a couple of weeks.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
His dogs were basically stuck at an airport.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He couldn't afford to bring him in.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They had to go into quarantine.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He was all messed up.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And the community came together immediately.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And donated the necessary, I think,

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
eight or nine hundred dollars for quarantine and transportation fees.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Which is absolutely a beautiful thing.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
All right.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going to kick it off right now with a brand new mashup.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Something that I just can't get enough of.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Because you've got to combine a couple of people to really come up with,

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
get down and hollock.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Come on, Gweney.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I mean, cue.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's it, if you go.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Attention, everyone.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're about to hear is not the mistake.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please do not turn off your rate.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But turn out the volume on your receiver as you play or go.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You want to get down.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Come on.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to go.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
All of this mashup.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All of girls up and be like this.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're right.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000

I want to go and do it.

Gwen Stefani's on the list and of course information about that particular

150
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,680
mashup coming from today's show notes daily source code dot com or I'll

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,920
also post it on curry dot com let's see got an email here from martin woodward

152
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,960
and he says just thought you want to know the Peter day is about the start

153
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,520
podcasting is in business show become a podcast starting the 19th of May so

154
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,480
that's tomorrow so I figured I'd plug it today Peter day is he's been with

155
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,760
the BBC for I think 35 years he's the guy that I talked about him on on a

156
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,560
previous source code he came up to the cottage and we talked and he put together

157
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,200
a great hour of radio which hopefully is still available somewhere in MP3

158
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,360
or podcast form because it kind of goes away from the BBC streaming you know

159
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,360
site or their streams for their daily program after you know new one comes out

160
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,880
but it was really good and you and you really rocked on to the much bigger

161
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,960
concept of what's going on here as we grab hold of the media front cells

162
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,280
it's really cool so you know what I said to him at the time excuse me you know

163
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,880
what that is it's the sense I'll hit me again what what I said at the time

164
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,280
was what we really need is we need people like you sir Peter day to come

165
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,000
into our community and teach us stuff because we forgot and so much about what

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,840
we've never really had you know never been exposed to how to interview someone on

167
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,840
the radio and you know in long form and and all kinds of stuff the BBC used to

168
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,280
do back in the day all things we know that are completely valid we can all

169
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,800
bring back and experiment with and play with and you know help us not to

170
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,200
reinvent too many wheels so that's really really cool that he'll start off

171
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,560
first by making his in business program a podcast and hopefully he'll do a

172
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,240
little bit more I'd spoke to him a great length about how cool it would be to

173
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,360
provide the raw source to the interviews that he does because he interviewed me

174
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,040
for an hour he's interviewed other people and you know it gets spliced together of

175
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,200
course and edited by the sandres is producer who does a great job but you know

176
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,040
they only have an hour to fill on Sunday evening so there's this opportunity to

177
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,640
leave the raw interview right sitting there for people to pick up you know and

178
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,880
subscribe to it and get the show and along with it to have the opportunity

179
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,240
to subscribe to perhaps a separate feed that would give you all the outtakes and this would

180
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:22,040
work for anything by the way it would work for Fox News for CNN for you know Bloomberg it

181
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,120
would work for anybody imagine how cool it would be instead of just listening to a

182
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,440
short interview of an analyst talking about a particular stock imagine

183
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,760
you know being able to listen to the whole interview with the analyst I mean this is a

184
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,600
great time saver and I think in many ways it's what radio has been waiting for so

185
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,040
what are you guys waiting for already and if you've forgotten what Peter Day

186
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,480
sounds like here's an example something remarkable is happening here radio is

187
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,760
springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who managed what you can hear since radio is

188
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,200
invented it's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say

189
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,040
okay now this promo has to be great because we're gonna sit it out to Adam Curry who's

190
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,520

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Arlonson Arlonson I guess I'm from Sweden hope you find some time to read this mail

205
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,520
blah blah I guess you've already heard this from other Swedish listeners and it might not be

206
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,120
big deal anymore just want to let you know that Swedish national radio is also giving podcasting

207
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,680
a shot right now there are three radio shows available for downloading I'll actually three RSS feeds

208
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,720
that is and he hopes that it'll extend you into even more I'm I'm pretty happy about that you know

209
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,120
um well first of all anyone who jumps into podcasting is great but Sweden has some very

210
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,400
interesting creative talents um on the music scene it seems like every couple of years they just

211
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:09,000
come out with an incredibly large mega smash hit band I'll just name a few I know you're going to

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,880
win but Abba rock set uh Europe remember them the final countdown um oh Britney Spears hit me

213
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,120
baby one more time written by a Swedish guy produced in Sweden I think or at least parts of it

214
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,280
produced in Sweden so there's um there's a lot going on there and I haven't subscribed yet but I'm

215
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,680
going to and hopefully there'll be playing some uh some Swedish music as well because it's a vibrant

216
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,840
scene out there and it's uh particularly um I think we'll see pod safe music coming from Sweden very

217
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,120
quickly once they catch the podcast bug so haven't seen a lot of Swedish podcast yet uh haven't

218
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,720
showed up really in the directory but looking forward to um the uh public the Swedish national radio

219
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,360
to give in that abuse that's extremely cool and Michael ends up saying I almost forgot remember

220
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,280
well pink glasses might look fly on a guy uggs that swirls are strictly for girls okay

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:10,520
I'm lame again if you missed uh me talking about voices from the vault the other day which is uh just

241
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,800
yeah this is a podcast the my Mac.com podcast it's like a radio show but it's on the internet

242
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:47,080
oh you get it okay okay no seriously this isn't a movie trailer okay you know what I just don't

243
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,600

245
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,040
yeah free so okay let's just roll the intro to our podcast yeah that's a good idea

246
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:11,480
let's pretend just about the analyst that's not our intro music check the next generation of radio

247
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:20,840
it's the my Mac.com podcast check the rocky theme song this is not a movie trailer stop it no I like it

248
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,000
in here podcasting from the my Mac.com studios it's your host Tim Robertson and Chad Perry

249
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,000
we're so much for our promo oh well

250
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,480
love that I think that was that was originally parts of was it Jerry Seinfeld's movie I think

251
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,280
comedian or something like that and they cut up very good excellent and yet all these computer

252
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,600
podcasts are not just for people who use computers or a Mac and Tosh in this case but I think

253
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,640
it'd be great for computer manufacturers and for software developers to listen to because basically

254
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,960
here's your audience you know telling you about what you like and what they don't like and in fact

255
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,000
I've seen it myself as I've been using megaseg for putting the pod show on the serious together

256
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,160
megaseg is it's an interesting program it really fits what I need for for doing most of my

257
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,280
production work and now I also don't get like the you know the the top dog at the company

258
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,240
emailing me I'm getting the early releases on stuff and it's not you know because well

259
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,000
it's because I'm talking about it using their product you know it's a great feedback loop

260
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,320
same goes for audio hijack pro from roga meba a rogue a meba man that's the hardest you are

261
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,640
all to type in by the way rogue a meba dot com same thing they've also put in several different

262
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,040
features that really aren't addition for podcasting they put it in with with podcasts as in

263
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,440
mind even though they're application actually I do use it I use it to record everything now

264
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,400
and I have changed the settings you've probably noticed that I'm now at what a 32 kilohertz

265
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,000
sample rate and then the encoding is at 80 kilo bits per second I mean it's really you got to look

266
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,120
for the trade-offs I was down to I was lower I was at 24 kilohertz sample rate but that doesn't

267
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,040
seem to work on a lot of handheld devices so bump it up to 32 which also doesn't seem to work on

268
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,680
a lot of the flash players that are out there so it's really a hunt and pick kind of methodology

269
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,160
so maybe I'll have to you know bump it back up to 44 and then of course I'll have to take down the

270
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,280
sample rate I was just it's crazy it's crazy oh one will cast blaster be done and out of beta that's

271
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,480
all I want to know a couple of days ago I was talking about the funny log entries and aircraft

272
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,880
maintenance logs Bob Evans sent me an email says listen to your stories about aircraft maintenance log

273
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,360
entries remind me of one of the funniest I encountered during 11 years of avionics work

274
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,040
while in the US Air Force I was involved in I was involved in a fix to a fighter jet with a CRT-based

275
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,600
bomb nav display so that's you know it's basically a glass cockpit I guess and you know there's a

276
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,360
screen that shows you I guess the status of your bombs and the status of your navigation and so the

277
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,440
pilots right up was the display looks like a rabbit sitting on a fence the corrective action

278
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,920
shot rabbit tore down fence because we got our butts chewed out a few days later but couldn't resist

279
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,640
it was well worth that I totally get it and so while we're on my favorite topic which is aviation

280
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:31,080
I found a great podcast fly with me which is basically airline pilots just sitting and talking

281
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,760
shit about what they do and they've got recordings of of the communications of the you know

282
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,200
basically the radio talking to flight services and other aircraft but they they put something in

283
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,320
really cool I don't really have a stop point in this I'm just going to play it from from a part

284
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,640
in the middle of the podcast where they talk about what else pilots do when they're up there in the

285
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,720
cockpit on a long haul flight when we're not talking to other pilots up there what else are we doing

286
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,960
well eating is a popular past time usually listen as two of our flight attendants give the captain

287
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,240
our dining options over the inner com and that's what gave you the bat the bat's were outside the door

288
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,280
if you want to yeah we're fine now we do some chips and um okay what's what do you have

289
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,600
if you're in all the bars that's a cracker is all uh animal cracker she's a cracker oh that sounds

290
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,520
kind of good but I don't know why I'm saving myself we have read the press

291
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:32,280
I think I just might have an altitude that'll solve my problems appear so but thank you

292
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,880
uh I'm sticking to Joseph here with his pieces he's fine so you know we're going to be on the ground

293
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,640
and so I'm going to fight it down to an airway and we're going to be there and it's about an hour

294
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,160
we should touch it down in the middle okay all checking on it okay thank you bye

295
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,960
well that was nice some of our flight attendants take good care of us up there in the cockpit

296
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,000
although they're more demanding jobs to take care of the passengers as with any job where you

297
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,960
deal with hundreds of people on any given day the people who stick out in your mind are either the

298
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,160
ones who are the most innocent or the most demanding here one flight attendant tells me about

299
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,320
two passengers who stood out in her mind

300
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:27,080
first class passing she's on my flight as we offer her some caviar

301
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,640
oh okay yeah and she didn't know what it was so she asked us and we said oh she's

302
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:41,800
shakes oh I want my scrambled oh man I can live so that forever totally cool fly with me

303
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,400
