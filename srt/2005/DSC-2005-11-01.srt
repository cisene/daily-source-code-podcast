Adam Curry's New Direction in Entertainment

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Adam Curry was once a videojockey whose talents were relegated to the broadcast airways of cable television

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today he has a new direction

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As the pioneer of podcasting, Adam Curry creates downloadable shows each day from the comfort of his own home

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This newfangled form of radio highlights Adam's very prominent new direction

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The general consensus is that Entertainment as we have known it has grown limp and lifeless claims Adam

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And I'm just the man to give the world the new direction they've been searching for

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Adam Curry's new direction crosses borders of geography

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That new direction extends to an audience of all ages, greens and colors

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Given the highly touted demographic Adam Curry reaches, it is apparent every day Adam gives a taste of his new direction

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Two males between the ages of 18 and 34

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This medium has the ability to reach everyone Adam says proudly

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want my new direction to be the new direction everyone is talking about

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
My new direction will bring the world to its knees

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Adam Curry's goal is to expose his new direction to men, women and children and possibly livestock

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Did I say he wants to expose his new direction to men?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, yes I did

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Pacifico's hellways world of tomorrow salute you Adam Curry and your new direction

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now matter how small and insignificant that new direction may seem today

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We are certain that we have not seen the last of your new direction

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey Bobby

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There are no secrets

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Holy information you don't be a liar

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Adam Curry

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
16 hours worth of silk boxer shorts wedged in my ass

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And so much then say what's coming up my ears

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We don't mean us taking care of him

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I like to think I'm flying into the toilet

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I guess he's fat on curry

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Almost live from the carnage of the 5-7 music Tuesday

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Day and over morning after

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Leaning back from a chair and a greasy spoon cafeteria

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Last night was some beer larynest on our way

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But again we're back in a lot of day

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Chanting shit sitting at the wall table

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Telling jokes playing with the salt

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Looking out the window

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Girl points two plates of full English circle

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We're plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomato

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Get my phone out

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You fuck up

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No no no

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm fucking I'm no way really

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm fucking take it a leave it

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Believe and then cow wins right

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
You need to hold it down, Jack, put your phone back

50
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,000
Quit staring, space in the inside, that's that

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You want you much more for not hanging on

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Stop me if I'm wrong, stop me if I'm wrong

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why should I see better one through the sides

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're richer, for I know I know I'm alright

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now the girl's rude, I know she's rude

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But she's rude, right through you, you've got your need soon

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll hit her voice, yeah it's getting burned

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know you have stuck, thinking I'm burned

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My goal, means you can fight with this girl

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Just like I said, that's all I know

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm alright, honestly, it's not like that

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah till I've come pranks and like a sack

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Jumping when she claps and that

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wait, do you really think I act like I'm telling you

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm serving the aces and it's game set a match

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Perfectly in control of this goal

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm gonna leave her all, I'll be foldin' I'm holding you tall

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Girls' old, high-speed girls

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Game over, game over, two Cole

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Holding her voice, yeah it's getting burned

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I know you have stuck, thinking I'm burned

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know, being she can fight with this girl

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just like I said, that's all I know

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I know you have stuck, thinking I'm hurt

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I know, being she can fight with this girl

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Just like I said, that's all I know

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm alright, honestly, it's not like that

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I know you have stuck, thinking I'm burned

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My goal, is getting burned

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I know you can't beat some female birth

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:54,040
Don't satisfy yourself, it's a mash-up and something new for something new for the mash-up

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,040
archive from James Burling, he actually sent this to me the other day, so just note

83
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,520
you'll take a look at the show, have a bit of a stick for six months or so, keep on rockin'

84
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,520
the free-ruled, anyways, heard the hay mug mash-up on Thursday's show, and suitably inspired

85
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,960
decide to have a crack myself, the result is don't satisfy yourself, mash up the rolling

86
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,360
stones and the streets, and you can check that out at flamemusic.com, very cool, I like it,

87
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,120
it's ended so incredibly British, you know, it's Tuesday, it's November 1, 2005, at least

88
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,160
that's what it is where I am right now, it may, you know, your results may vary due to time

89
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,600
and other weather conditions, it's all pod save music Tuesday, I was listening through a

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,840
whole bunch of tracks on the PMN Pod Save Music Network, listening to a couple CDs that

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,120
came in and Patricia, you know, she kept walking and saying, oh that's good, what's that, and

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,080
oh, that's brother love, right, and just kept going in and out and I said, you know what, why

93
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,520
don't I just play a whole bunch of pod save music tracks, did you hear that? I almost sound

94
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,960
like Susie Chapman, Susie Chapman, what is that worrying here? One of the machines is probably

95
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,840
the crap, but the crap was hasn't been very, hasn't been very good since I got back,

96
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,720
it seems a little sickly, after that Windows update from yesterday just hasn't been the same.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,520
Okay, so we will be talking about a couple other things as well, interesting interview from the

98
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,040
the CEO of SBC, you know, I'm gonna grab, let me do that for you right now, this was something

99
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,360
that was a business week article that was, I don't know if it was pointed out to me if I stumbled

100
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:33,080
across it. I just want to read you a quote from the CEO Edward Whitaker of SBC Telecommunication,

101
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,280
these guys are huge, right, so they own lots and lots of pipe, lots and lots of telco services,

102
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,800
and here it is, let me just get down to this one piece. Okay, now this is really, really interesting,

103
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,320
because, you know, back in the day, the cable systems totally believed that they ruled the world

104
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,320
and they should be paid, in fact, in many, many countries in the world. Broadcasters actually pay

105
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,920
cable systems to be carried throughout whatever their territory is. Now with the internet, of course,

106
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,800
that works a little bit differently because customers basically pay for access to the net. So the

107
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,440
question here in business week is, how concerned are you about internet upstarts like Google,

108
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,000
MSN, Vonage, and others? And here's the answer, how do you think they're going to get to customers

109
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,040
through a broadband pipe? Cable companies have them. We have them. Now what they would like to

110
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,920
do is use my peat my pipes for free, but I ain't going to let them do that because we've spent

111
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,600
capital, and we have to have a return for it. So there's going to have to be some mechanism for

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,680
these people who use these pipes to pay for the court portion they're using. Why should they be

113
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,320
allowed to use my pipes? The internet can't be free in that sense, because we in the cable companies

114
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,040
have made an investment and for Google, or Yahoo, or Vonage, or anybody to expect to use these

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:56,360
pipes for free is nuts exclamation point. Well, ain't that interesting? What the hell does that mean?

116
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,320
You want to get paid both ways? I mean, we're already paying for the access. Now you want to charge

117
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:09,640
Google and Yahoo to deliver data? I don't know, man. That sounds freaking scary to me, because what's next?

118
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,840
Podcasts, of course, because we're shipping a shitload of data across the pipes, and now we're

119
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,640
going to start charging for it. We got to keep our eye on this dude, man. He's dangerous.

120
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:53,240
Something deeper, because I need to know there's someone to come hold you and laugh with and

121
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:03,000
think about when I make up my mind to hold you to know you. I'm a lucky man. Well, yeah,

122
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:13,080
I'll see the chicks that smoke and drink. I'll be right home when you eat in the glass.

123
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:27,240
The lips, I'm a massive alien. I know you'll follow me. He's out of your arms. I'll know you'll drown

124
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:53,640
over me. I don't need to scare you. I'm just telling you how I feel. Just look into my eyes.

125
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:03,320
Never do you ever try to trust me. It's risky. I'm not trying to catch a hole. I've been through

126
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:14,280
well. It's for ringing. I'm a thrive of me alone. Yeah, I'm sick of chicks that smoke and drink.

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:30,280
I'm alive and I won't wait for life. The lips, I'm a massive alien. I know you'll follow me. He's out

128
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:43,320
of your arms. I'll know you'll drown over me. He's out of your arms. I'll know you'll drown over me.

129
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:58,360
I don't need to scare you. You'll drown over me. He's out of your arms. I'll be right home when you're

130
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I'm sick and sick and sick, that's all

131
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,360
In dream, lie, how we ain't in for life

132
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,360
You live, tell the best you can

133
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,360
The things that are real, I know you

134
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Follow me down from your heart

135
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Don't mess around, no mess around

136
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:32,360
That's for me, because I know why you're me

137
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Because I know why you're me

138
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Because I know why you're me

139
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Don't mess around, no mess around

140
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
From the album of the year

141
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
As it's titled, Brother Love, the second chicks

142
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Podsafe, on your daily source code

143
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,360
This is Tuesday, Podsafe, music Tuesday

144
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Just rollin' out a whole bunch of excellent songs

145
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Brother Love was sweet enough to send over a copy of the album

146
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
He had sent it while I was in San Francisco

147
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
And so of course he sent it to the UK address

148
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Which I gave him earlier

149
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
He was here waiting for him with a couple of brother Love T-shirts

150
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
One for me, one for Patricia, one for Christina

151
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,360
And he is still without a doubt the undisputed king of the Podsafe music network

152
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Top and pod play

153
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Go check it out at music.podshow.com

154
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm amazed, every day there's like

155
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I knew up to 50 to 100 tracks coming in

156
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
It's crazy

157
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
It's crazy

158
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Yesterday I played

159
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,360
A mini-mini sound seeing tour from Graham Shaw about his Senseo machine

160
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
And I was amazed about these different speeds that I heard

161
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm like, oh my god, I actually played it for you

162
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Listen to this

163
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Because my Senseo basically makes this noise

164
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
But then I was stuck in his cover

165
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
I was stuck in his cover when I went into overdrive

166
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Listen to this

167
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Oh man, that's three gears on this thing

168
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Do I have the wrong model?

169
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
So I received an email

170
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Adam, the change in tone was me

171
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Clumsily speeding up the dead air to bring my audio feedback down

172
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
From a minute 59 to a minute 39

173
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
I thought this Senseo noises added something to it

174
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,360
But I didn't meant to think of anything interesting to say

175
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
I was my first attempt at anything audio though

176
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
And it was done at a single take

177
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,360
When I recorded the first bit I really had my Senseo still on Amazon packaging

178
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Which is sitting next to me, absolutely Graham

179
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
It's just freaked me out

180
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
So you may want to get audacity

181
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Or some other freeware open source program

182
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
And edit that next time

183
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Instead of foolishly

184
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Speeding it up

185
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
It really had me freaked out

186
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
And I actually I went

187
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
I went downstairs

188
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
And I made a couple of Senseo

189
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
And I tried the dual button

190
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
See if it was a dual button thing that you had

191
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
For two cups of coffee

192
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
But now I know the answer

193
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
But of course it is

194
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
It is just a thought for the designers

195
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
That find machine

196
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,360
No one was received for this discussion about Senseo

197
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Tap up the cards

198
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
That card

199
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Hi, I'm Mr John Rob here from topofthepods.com

200
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Last week we heard a message on the daily source code

201
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
About a podcast

202
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Having a dilemma about displaying the show notes

203
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
That might spoil the content of the show

204
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
As you might know

205
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
We recorded a daily podcast

206
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Where each show we talk about a topic in the form of top 10 list

207
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Now we had a similar problem with our show notes

208
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Just playing each top 10

209
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
And that was spoiling it for the listeners

210
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
The solution we came up with

211
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
This UCSS

212
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
That's cascading style sheets

213
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
To hide the spoilers by default

214
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Then use a small piece of JavaScript code

215
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
To display them

216
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
It saves you having to create two different versions of the show notes

217
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
And most importantly

218
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Doesn't spoil any surprises for listeners

219
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Whilst remaining totally search engine friendly

220
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
If you'd like to see this in action

221
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
And help yourself to the code we wrote

222
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Then head over to topofthepods.com

223
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
And we there feel free to check out our show as well

224
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
We also noticed that the idols going down

225
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
A storm at the pod show headquarters

226
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Now we love this gadget so much

227
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
We've teamed up with Firebox to offer podcast listeners

228
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360

229
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360

234
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
Thanks Adam

235
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Thanks very much

236
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Bye

237
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Now thank you

238
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Thank you for helping me with

239
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Another eye dog mention

240
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
I have to do one once a week in the show

241
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Christine I immediately took it from me by the way

242
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
I'm trying to get her to do an endorsement for the for the eye dog

243
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
She's already run out of pair of batteries

244
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
You have the thing on for like

245
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
20 hours straight

246
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Just popping along

247
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
It's like you know

248
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
The batteries will eventually wear out

249
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
But it's interesting to see how they've I'd like to know a little bit more about the programming of the eye dog

250
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,360
How they you know what what

251
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,360
What decisions they made in writing in writing the code because it seems that

252
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,360
It has a certain patterns that the lights move in the ears move when there are strings

253
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,360
And it doesn't really seem to go to a to a beat necessarily

254
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
But still it's synchronized

255
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,360
I don't know it sounds like maybe there's some sophisticated

256
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Digital sound processing in there. I have no idea

257
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Let's see

258
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Oh, yes, this is an important thing I have to say

259
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
I've received many many emails about this

260
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,360
There is no such thing as a dual CPU iMac stop it you're driving me nuts

261
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Multiple people wrote in about that

262
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Okay, I'm sorry. I thought there was I thought there was going to be a dual processor G5 iMac

263
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
I was wrong apparently that's only the desktop

264
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,360
So about I'm real happy with the ones that I have the one here in the cottage and the one at the condo

265
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:37,360
And people also correctly told me that the 10-foot screen interface that I'm that what I call the 10-foot screen interface is called front row

266
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Right, I'm wondering if there's a way to get front row on different computers if you can

267
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,360
If you can install the software and maybe use a universal remote or buy remote separately

268
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,360
And of course you have to hook up some kind of infrared receiving device because I really do enjoy it

269
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,360
And of course, I still have the the older G5 iMac. I'm too fucking lazy

270
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
I'm just too lazy to call up return it everything's working it's installed

271
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,360
It's fine. I don't need the camera and the CPU powers okay for what I'm using it for so I'm not going to take it back

272
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,360
And what's cool though is I do have the other G5 iMac and the condo I have it set up and the middle of the floor with one of the

273
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,360
One of the shades raised just you have to keep the shades kind of closed because

274
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Especially when you're not there and during the day it'll bleach your furniture or the sunlight that comes in through all those

275
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,360
You know wonderful wonderful panoramic view windows

276
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:35,360
So I've raised it up just a little bit and I can dial into it using iChat and I can see what the weather is in terms of scope

277
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Yeah, yeah, I'm geeky. I know hey, I also received the brand new

278
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Hold on let me just grab it

279
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,360
The brand new mojoan CD these are the guys from Holland that I played before and I think I had somewhat of a

280
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,360
A planetary intergalactic premiere with what I think will be the single like the or the whatever

281
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
They're going to be pushing to radio. I think that's what is it my world?

282
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,360
Well, the title of the album is my world and if it's always the same it was I think was always the same is what they're pushing

283
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,360
But I listened to it this morning and there's a lot of great tracks on this you can find that at mojoans.nl

284
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,360
Mojoan ES dot nl

285
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,360
These guys are independent. They've really been working very very hard of known for a number of years

286
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,360
And I just and totally once again in love with their work

287
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Check this out. This is a very very typical low-jones track

288
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Can't get enough on the daily source code

289
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Can't get enough can't get enough

290
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,360
I can't get enough can't get enough

291
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Can't get enough can't get enough

292
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Can't get enough of you

293
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
You're gonna be stuck

294
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Trust me

295
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,360
You're gonna drive this car

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,360
You're so I'm gonna be played on radio

297
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Trust me

298
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
It's terrible in advance

299

I trust you

300
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,360
You're gonna travel the road

301
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Anywhere the wind blows

302
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
This town's much too small

303
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
You gonna get them all

304
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
The world's a little tiny bowl

305
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Trust me

306
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Can't get enough can't get enough

307
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,360
I can't get enough can't get enough

308
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Can't get enough can't get enough

309
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,360
Can't get enough of you

310
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,360
I smile and be eating

311
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,360
And what you do is made

312
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
You gotta move your hips

313
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Fill up your lips

314
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Take silicone tips

315
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
And you're gonna make it

316
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Trust me

317
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,360
You gotta go and stop

318
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Follow my advice

319
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
One day you realize

320
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,360
I am always right trust me

321
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
You'll be fine

322
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Trust me

323
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Can't get enough can't get enough

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,360
I can't get enough can't get enough

325
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Can't get enough can't get enough

326
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Can't get enough of you

327
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Can't get enough can't get enough

328
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
I can't get enough can't get enough

329

Can't get enough can't get enough

330
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Can't get enough of you

331
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,360
And if you can't recall what I just said

332
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,360
You got a different story I had in your eye

333
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Playin' another game stuff

334
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Sayin' your match, I found someone new

335
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I had enough of you

336
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,360
I had enough, I had enough of you

337
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
I had enough of you

338
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,360
I had enough of you

339
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
I had enough of you

340
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,480
I've had enough, I've had enough, I've had enough, I've had enough.

341
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,260
You're absolutely cool.

342
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,400
I've had enough.

343
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,960
When you unwrap a new CD and slide it into your drive slot.

344
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,680
And then iTunes opens up, ready to import it,

345
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,520
and then you get the message saying,

346
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,520
the CDD, date, C-D-D, C-D-B, database,

347
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,860
does not recognize this disk.

348
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,100
You're like, oh, yeah, I'm the first one.

349
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,600
I can enter all the information correctly.

350
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,600
That is, that's like CD porn, right there, man?

351
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,280
Mm-hmm, love that.

352
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,960
By the way, you know, I almost bought the CD-D-B database.

353
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,280
It was in, oh, man, it was, it must have been 1996.

354
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,160
1996 or 1996, maybe even, you know, seven, I think.

355
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,120
And I called the guys up, I said, this is phenomenal.

356
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,440
I want to buy this, you know, this is great.

357
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,520
And they just sold it a week earlier.

358
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,960
And of course, now it's licensed to every single player in the world,

359
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,360
oh, well, what have been good?

360
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,840
Hey Adam says that Tim Smith, I know you get tons of mail,

361
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,680
so I'll keep this one short on your daily source code,

362
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,000
270, you mentioned you were using Windows.

363
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,040
Now, forgive me if I'm mistaken,

364
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,800
but I thought you were an Apple guy.

365
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,280
Why are you, or were you using Windows?

366
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,240
Well, that's it, I guess.

367
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,440
Thanks for finding time to read this.

368
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,960
Maybe you can enlighten us on the next show.

369
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,640
Well, 270, this is 271, real simple Tim.

370
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,480
I have a mix of all kinds of stuff here.

371
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,600
Of course, I'm an Apple guy.

372
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,960
I love Apple computers.

373
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,640
I just, you know, I am totally smoking the crack pipe there.

374
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,400
But you got to have Windows, and I bought a craplet,

375
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,840
which is kind of cool because I have it on top of the podcast complex.

376
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
And I use it basically.

377
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,480
I use it as a screen for show notes and emails that want to read.

378
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,880
In fact, I'm reading your Gmail email right now off of the craplet screen.

379
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,520
It's kind of cool because the screen will twist and tilt and turn,

380
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,680
because you're able to turn it all the way back and fold it over

381
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,600
to make it into a tablet.

382
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,160
So I can twist it just perfectly so I can see it.

383
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,200
It's at eye height now.

384
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,360
So that's really, but I use a mix of all kinds

385
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,200
of different operating systems and computers.

386
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,640
In fact, when you have a Mac these days,

387
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,800
you basically also have a Unix machine.

388
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,400
And I find myself increasingly using Unix commands,

389
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,600
just because it's so much faster than starting up a GUI,

390
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,440
of some program, or finding something and dragging and dropping.

391
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,360
And once you know how to tab auto complete paths and file names

392
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,240
in a command line, you're really off to the races.

393
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,360
And you can pipe stuff.

394
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,880
And yeah, if you can do a little bit of shell scripting

395
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,920
kind of on the command line, if you ever learn to do that,

396
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,160
is really going to help you with a lot of shit.

397
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,720
And also when files get locked up and stuff,

398
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,800
it's easy to go in and just sort of rebooting

399
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,080
or whatever other fix there may be if a file doesn't want to delete,

400
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,680
you just go into command line and get rid of it.

401
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,280
By the way, I've also made some horrible mistakes

402
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,440
from doing that.

403
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,080
Well, like RMSH, that was one of my favorites.

404
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,640
We interrupt this podcast to this question.

405
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
Who is Matthew Evil?

406
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,040
Official sources give conflicting reports.

407
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,280
Some claim he's an independent musician.

408
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,160
Others say he's an intergalactic superhero.

409
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,000
One report even goes so far as to say he's a ninja barista

410
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,600
with a bad attitude.

411
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,920
So just who is Matthew Evil?

412
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,440
If you think you know, you could win a copy of his new album,

413
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,040
beer and coffee, send your completely fabricated

414
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,640
and absolute baloney biography to who is at Matthew Evil.com.

415
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,400
If your bio gets used on the website, you'll earn a free CD

416
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,440
from Matthew Evil to read the gods on his truth

417
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,760
and a whole lot of fabricated crap.

418
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,440
Visit www.methu Evil.com today.

419
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,400
So what do you think of the new format with the pod save music now?

420
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,160
I don't know if it's sustainable at all if I can find four or five songs

421
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,640
that I really like that I want to play every day.

422
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,360
Having a good one on this Tuesday, Fraut Safe Tuesday.

423
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,840
There was a time when nothing stood in between us.

424
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,920
Now there's a curve in the world so sharp it'll make you bleed.

425
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,240
We don't talk with just puts the clock,

426
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,120
can't find each other in the same old grid that may be a little escape.

427
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,560
What we need.

428
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,840
We love and you work like a dog every morning.

429
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,280
The city's a pain like the loud taste stain on your dress.

430
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,440
Hit in the bay and before you break down,

431
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,640
it don't cause the damn to leave this town.

432
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,360
We don't know the road because we got to get out of this mess.

433
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,200
So let's drive away.

434
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,280
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

435
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:04,600
Now nothing gonna stay in a way.

436
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Let's drive away.

437
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,840
We're in the song and that took it for granted.

438
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,280
We're bumping the road not really in part of the drive.

439
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,920
Come on, come on to eat self-right.

440
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,640
You made me bleed tonight.

441
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,960
The pain's here so damn good to be alive.

442
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,720
So let's drive away.

443
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,080
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

444
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,480
Now nothing gonna stay in a way.

445
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,440
Let's drive away.

446
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:30,120
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

447
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,680
Sorry, but I seem fast, but I gotta go in.

448
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,800
It's gotta be more than the coffee shops in the bar.

449
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,560
Lady, maybe it's too late.

450
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,120
Lady, maybe it's just late.

451
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,880
We need to take my hand and get in the car.

452
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

453
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,520
So let's drive away.

454
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,880
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

455
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:11,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

456
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:19,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

457
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,160
Call me an 80s-oriented, figure-her'd flag, give you my spend.

458
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,680
Someone else's gotta like the sugar.

459
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,160
Oh yeah.

460
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Matthew Ebo from the bot save music network, check it out at music.botshow.com.

461
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Definitely that top-down driving around sound.

462
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,160
It doesn't quite fit with the weather today in the United Kingdom.

463
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Also, don't have a convertible.

464
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
I want to help.

465
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Thanks by the way to the Pacific Coast Hellplayers for the opening of today's Daily Source Code.

466
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
Marking my command and nip cough.

467
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,160
It was nice enough to send me that.

468
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Ah yes, my new direction.

469
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
It's what everyone's talking about.

470
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Hello Adam.

471
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,160
This is Dave Owen.

472
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
It's time.

473
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,160
She will always help me.

474
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Hello Adam.

475
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
This is Dave Owen.

476
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
A.K.A. On the week.

477
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Formally of Olympia Washington.

478
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Now, living up here in North Vancouver, BC.

479
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Hey, I thought I'd give you a holiday because I was catching up on some shows.

480
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,160
And expresses the empathy for you about your turmoil.

481
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Putting together some of that IKEA furniture.

482
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
But I tell you, you're not alone.

483
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,160
You see, just moving up here to Vancouver, I had to get some IKEA gear.

484
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,160
And being a little older and wiser, I got it delivered.

485
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Yet the guys came with the truck on a Sunday to deliver it and looked up at the steps to get

486
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
into my house.

487
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Yeah, and they weren't going to do it without the extra fee.

488
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:00,160
So I had to bribe them with super tasty nugs and a little hash sprinkled on top.

489
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,160
And sure enough, I got the couch flat into the house.

490
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Then it was up to me to figure out how to assemble the thing.

491
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
I was so confused.

492
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I figured I might as well record it and I make a podcast out of it.

493
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Now, don't be alarmed.

494
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,160
All my podcasts aren't about assembly and furniture.

495
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
And well, I make several of them.

496
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Now, I don't know if you remember a few months back at Nomdex in Seattle hanging out on the balcony

497
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,160
overlooking the cruise ships and joined a dude with my colleague, Cosmo and I.

498
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,160
But since Nomdex, we started busing out a bunch of different podcasts including the club site

499
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Breakfast time podcast.

500
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
I can't remember.

501
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Additionally, I make a couple others.

502
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,160
The one that I talk about the IKEA furniture is chug lawn with Uncle Wee.

503
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,160
That's me mostly schlepping my laptop around Vancouver, taking transit, scoring herb, talking

504
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,160
about architecture, economics, transportation, and...

505
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Well, weed.

506
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Notice the scoring weed comes before he talks about architecture.

507
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Additionally, I make a show called Postcards from Gravity Beach.

508
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
There's 16 of these up already.

509
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,160
And it's me reading from my literary heroes,

510
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Carawak, Tolstoy, Broad again, James Joyce, etc.

511
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
As well as reading some of my own work.

512
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Yeah, I have some audacity to try and follow those guys.

513
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
But I'm having a good time with it.

514
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
I put some smoking jazz tracks in the background,

515
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,160
or sometimes even play along with some live music.

516
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Finally, for hockey fans, I make one called The Conucks Outsideer for the local hockey team here.

517
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,160
You know, I don't have any inside contacts, so I'm like, I'm just the Conucks Outsideer.

518
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
And I'm having a good time with that one too.

519
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Now, that's a lot of podcasts to remember if you want to check them all out.

520
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
But you can, they're all listed in iTunes.

521
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Grab postcards from Gravity Beach, club site breakfast time podcast,

522
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Chugle on with Uncle Ween, and Conucks Outsideer.

523
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Now, the easy way to do that is just go to UncleWeed.net

524
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
and pick up all the feeds there.

525
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,160
And don't worry, all these podcasts have lots of shows already,

526
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
so they're not disappearing.

527
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Uh-huh, Adam, I guess it's just one more thing than closing.

528
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Spark one for you.

529
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:14,160
You know, we've been talking a lot about podcasting and education

530
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:21,160
about using RSS feeds and enclosures and podcast pod catchers for lectures.

531
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,160
And there's been some debate about that, but, you know,

532
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,160
luckily, the debate seems to be kind of raging on outside of the educational system

533
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,160
because colleges and schools are catching on.

534
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Hey, Adam, we're back in Dota Sierra, Charlie 267.

535
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,160
You were talking about universities and podcasts.

536
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,160
And you said, of course, it's great to be able to have an RSS feed

537
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:46,160
from either a certain course, a certain class, a certain professor, a certain lecturer.

538
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
I think it should be turned around.

539
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
You damn right, it should be turned around.

540
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Who wants to hear from me, a lowly lecturer, when you can hear from our far more exciting

541
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
and engaging students, no one.

542
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,160
That's why here at the I-Generation Honours course in Communication Studies

543
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,160
at the University of Western Australia, the students are doing podcasts

544
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
as their major assignments.

545
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,160
We've got everything from an alternative commentary to the Simpsons

546
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,160
to a parotic pod play, satirizing the bold and the beautiful.

547
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,160
If you're all your listeners want to know more, you can visit us at

548
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,160
iphonegeneration.blogspot.com on the web, all search for

549
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
I-Generation in the Archions Music Store.

550
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,160
For a quick test, here's something every good play needs.

551
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
An Intimition from Queen of Petey.

552
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
No, no, no, so I cut the intermission out.

553
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
I didn't have enough time.

554
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
I just saw the funniest thing happen.

555
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm looking at my window.

556
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,160
And we have, of course, more painters and guys here today.

557
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,160
So there's a car parked in front of our house.

558
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Did you ring the bell?

559
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,160
In the cul-de-sac, and I saw the neighbor back as car.

560
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Oh, man.

561
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
He backed his, his beamer.

562
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Three something.

563
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Three series.

564
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
He backed it out.

565
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,160
And backed it right into the, into the painter's car.

566
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
And.

567
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Yeah, I bet she rang the doorbell.

568
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Well, I can't stop the show for that.

569
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm sorry.

570
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
I used to sneak around in order to see you on Saturday nights.

572
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,160
I was 15 and you used too much aquanette.

573
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,160
I was supposed to be asleep, but I just couldn't resist the lure of

574
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
headbangers ball.

575
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Hey, I hear you're really into that show lost.

576
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
My husband and I might have something right up your alley.

577
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Hello, Adam.

578
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,160
This is Ryan Jen somewhat jealous husband.

579
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
And yeah, we're so much into lost.

580
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,160
That's filmed right here on this island on Luhavey.

581
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,160
That we started a podcast devoted entirely to the show.

582
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
It's called The Transmission.

583
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Now that Apple and ABC have partnered together to sell episodes of this great show

584
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
on the iTunes music store.

585
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Think of our show as a free perfect companion.

586
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,160
On every show, we do a recap of the last episode.

587
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,160
We analyze it to death.

588
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
And then we take listener comments.

589
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,160
We listen to some theories, which is the best part.

590
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,160
We talk about some production news, spoilers, rumors, all kinds of stuff.

591
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:01,160
So Adam and anybody who is a fan of what Stephen King calls the best show on television

592
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
come check out The Transmission.

593
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,160
We even do a special enhanced version with chapters and graphics for those of you

594
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
cool enough to be using iPods.

595
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,160
You can find us on the iTunes music store.

596
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,160
You can just look for us under a lost or you can come straight to our website at

597
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,160
HavaEup.com slash lost and listen to it straight from the site.

598
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
And thanks for your great show, Adam.

599
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
I still love you.

600
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Hey.

601
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Yeah, I love you too, baby.

602
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

603
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,160

Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

608
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

609
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

610
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

614
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

615
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

616
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

617
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

618
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

619
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Oh, they got insurance forms out now.

620
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Oh, they got insurance version out now.

621
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Okay.

622
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:40,160
But as you go away, what's funny is to ride?

623
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Dashing through the snow, in one horse open sea,

624
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Or the fields we go, laughing all the way,

625
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:08,160
There's on both tailoring, making spirits bright

626
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:19,160
What fun it is to ride and sing a sing song tonight

627
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Chicken chicken one day, all the fun it is to ride in one horse open sea,

628
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Chicken five, chicken five, chicken one way, what fun it is to ride?

629
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Or the fields we dash, dancing through the snow,

630
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Chicken five, chicken one day, all the way, chicken one day, all the fun it is to ride in one horse open sea,

631
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Chicken five, chicken one day, all the fun it is to ride in one horse open sea,

632
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,360
Chicken five, chicken one night, all the fun it is to ride,

633
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Chicken five, chicken one day, all the fun it is to ride in one horse open sea,

634
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:57,760
I think we discussed this before, you know, shades of Mariah Carey only, goodbye Mariah.

635
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,760
We've got our own Podsafe Mariah and Lovener.

636
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Now what's this? Ah yes, of course, the music tells me I'm ready.

637
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Hi Adam Steve Webb here, thanks for listening to the invitation I appreciate it.

638
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,760
The anniversary, the one-year anniversary for life's spring is coming up.

639
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,760
It's going to be actually right after the podcast Expo.

640
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
You remember this?

641
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
When I go out girl?

642
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Okay, hold on, I'll tell you what, why don't you listen to this promo, I'm going to let the dog

643
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
out of my office here.

644
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,760
It's almost like the old days, isn't it?

645
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Hitting you right between the years with the message of hope, love and good news.

646
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,760
This is life's spring, and I'm Steve Webb, your host.

647
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Hey Adam, thanks for this brand new avenue with communication we all call podcasting.

648
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,760
And thanks everybody for listening.

649
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
I'm out of here.

650
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
Thanks everybody.

651
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,760
The Lord says everybody, give me a bow.

652
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Oh man, perfect. I'm telling you, I love religious podcasts.

653
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,760
There's broadcasters of all sorts.

654
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
I get to kick it.

655
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Yeah, I sent that promo into your way back in December.

656
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,760
And then I was just really tickled when you played it for me on the daily source code.

657
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
But I've got an invitation for you.

658
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,760
This I think would be totally unexpected by the rest of the community.

659
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,760
And that would be how about Adam Curry being interviewed by one of the godcasters.

660
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
And I'm trying to put together really special show.

661
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,760
And I thought it would be really great if we could do a little

662
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,760
little conversation you and me.

663
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
I think it'd be fun.

664
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,760
I hope you're enjoying your time at home with the girls.

665
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
I know it's been a long time for you.

666
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,760
And so I'm sure it's good to see Christina and Patricia.

667
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Please tell the two of them that I said hi as well.

668
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,760
And I also wanted to say thanks again in person here as a work for playing Jimmy Bradshaw's music.

669
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,760
If you go or to the PMN listing for Jimmy, you'll see that several podcasts have played his music.

670
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
And I think that's great.

671
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
He's enjoying it.

672
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,760
And I think that we're helping to get the word out as well.

673
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:18,760
So Adam, enjoy your weekend and enjoy your time back home before you come back to California here.

674
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,760
I do hope to see you in Ontario.

675
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,760
But if not, I'd sure like to talk to you for the life spring podcast.

676
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Thanks again Adam and blessings on you.

677
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
Oh, thank you.

678
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
It's so sweet.

679
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
So Patricia came back.

680
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,760
She stood with the guys outside for a while trying to figure out what it happened.

681
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,760
I wonder she's going to come up and tell me what's so amazing.

682
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
It was like a slapstick.

683
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,760
It must have been the sun or something that was in his eyes.

684
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Hey, it's Pod said music Tuesday on the Daily Source Code.

685
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,760
We have one more pod save tune than roll out for you after one more piece of feedback.

686
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
With $600 worth of rest.

687
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Strap to my bonus.

688
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
I'm Stalin, man.

689
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Hi Adam.

690
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,760
This is Graham coming to you from beneath the huge beautiful skies of North

691
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
England with little feedback on the DSC.

692
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,760
First heard about it when I steep mentioned it in his keynote a few months back when they

693
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
launched.

694
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,760
First mentioned the iTunes were going to be supporting pod cast.

695
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,760
I got to say that initially I thought you were just some big headfag with a fucking ego

696
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
problem.

697
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Jesus, man, you got stuff to say.

698
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,760
I've just got so excited about all this stuff.

699
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,760
You've got going down at podshow.com and hearing about all the new great stuff with pod casting

700
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,760
and it's really, really blowing my skirt up right now.

701
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,760
I'll tell you.

702
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,760
The pod save music network.

703
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,760
I've been kind of trolling around that just recently and it's just fucking phenomenal, man.

704
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,760
I tell you, I discovered this artist called Alison Crowe who you've just got to get some

705
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,760
of her stuff and put it on your pod show.

706
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
Outstanding stuff.

707
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,760
I also thought it would be really useful to have an extra genre for sort of jingles and intros and

708
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,760
outro and all that for us kind of newbie pod casters who don't know how to put all that stuff

709
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,760
together to be able to download stuff and use it on their shows which would be kind of

710
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
cool too.

711
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,760
That's pretty much what I've got to say.

712
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Just want to keep up the good work, Adam.

713
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
We love what you're doing.

714
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Really excited about it.

715
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
I don't know how many people out there.

716
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,760
Share your excitement or whatever.

717
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,760
This must be how Henry Ford must have laid a wake at night thinking how the fuck am I going to take all of this

718
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,760
great technology and put it in a hands of just everybody.

719
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,760
There's some good stuff going down and it's interesting to be the part of the next real big thing.

720
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Talk to you soon.

721
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
Keep it real.

722
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Take care.

723
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,760
You know, I'm thinking that Henry Ford was probably laying a week at the laying a wake

724
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
at night going.

725
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,760
How do I get a hammer in the back seat?

726
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Or pod safety is the wind up the show for today.

727
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
Bob Gentry and upside down.

728
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,760
I've been talking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

729
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Well, my tongue is tight.

730
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,760
I've been thinking I should leave.

731
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Instead of waiting for her when the time is right.

732
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,760
I've backed the bags under my eyes.

733
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:19,760
Well, I've seen enough to know what it's like.

734
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,760
Just turning me upside down.

735
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

736
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,760
All I can do is try it.

737
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,760
When everything's breaking me down.

738
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Looking at me down side out.

739
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,760
Well, those rules got changed somehow.

740
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Maybe it's suicide.

741
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,760
To stay here and just stick around.

742
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,760
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now.

743
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,760
Till now.

744
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:09,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

745
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,760
Well, my legs are tight.

746
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,760
I've been thinking I should leave.

747
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:28,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

748
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

749
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

750
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

751
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

752
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,760
When everything's breaking me down.

753
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,760
Looking at me down side out.

754
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Well, those rules got changed somehow.

755
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,760
Maybe it's suicide.

756
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,760
To stay here and just stick around.

757
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,760
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now.

758
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,760
Till now.

759
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:20,760
I've been afraid to just walk out.

760
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:36,760
Ain't no way to stop me now.

761
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

762
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

763
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,760
Looking at me down side out.

764
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,760
Well, those rules got changed somehow.

765
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,760
Maybe it's suicide.

766
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,760
To stay here and just stick around.

767
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,760
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now.

768
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Oh, till now.

769
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

770
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

771
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,760
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up.

772
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Until now.

773
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,760
Oh, man.

774
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,760
I could just play all those songs over again tomorrow.

775
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,760
The same type of show.

776
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,760
Just loving it.

777
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,760
Of course, I'm that giddy at this configured the valve process.

778
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,760
So you heard me kind of switch it on there in the last moments of the show?

779
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Oh, yeah.

780
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,760
That was great, Curry.

781
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,760
Idiot.

782
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
Idiot.

783
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
And just in on the Gmail.

784
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Hmm.

785
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Hi Adam.

786
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,760
I work for Channel 4 News.

787
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760
That's over here in the UK.

788
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,760
We're making a feature for more for news to broadcast this Friday on the phenomenon of porn

789
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,760
casting.

790
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,760
I think it would be awful to consider running such a piece without your input.

791
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,760
So if you have the time, I'd like to come to see you at some point this week to conduct an interview on the subject.

792
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,760
The interview would be short and sweet or as we say.

793
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,760
New style.

794
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,760
Hopefully I could be out of your hair and have another hair joke, man.

795
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,760
Hopefully I could be out of your hair and a half hour or so.

796
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,760
If you're too busy, maybe we could set up an eye chat or something similar.

797
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
That would be kind of cool.

798
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,760
Talk about porn casting on the eye chat.

799
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,760
Hmm.

800
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
Not to think about that if I have time or not.

801
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,760
All right.

802
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,760
DailySourceco.com is where you can find the latest show and where you can find the RSS feed to

803
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
use to subscribe.

804
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,760
I'm also putting the iTunes link these days in the direct show notes.

805
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,760
Not in the extended show notes, but in the direct show notes.

806
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,760
And if you're got anything to say about the songs, check it out there or send me email

807
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,760
Adam at curry.com.

808
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,760
And I'm back tomorrow for the hump day edition.

809
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
I'm the source code.

810
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,760
Another pod show podcast.

811
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,760
Stick it in your ear.
