1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Delta share a Charlie one nine or one.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,320
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:13,360
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since radio is invented.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,920
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,280
It's Adam Curry!

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,880
You are a bitch!

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,280
Boo!

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,920
Oh yeah!

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,600
Oh yeah!

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,200

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,880
Oh yeah!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,360
I apologize I'm a dick.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,800
Oh dick, some respect.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,520

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:31,920
Oh yeah.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,600
Oh yeah.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,440
It's you.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,440
What are you, what are you up to?

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,160
I'm in a dick.

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
Oh dick, some respect.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
By the way, you're hearing that wild cherry sign.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,720
I was like, what was that 1970?

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,080
You say 78?

24
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,720
Something like that?

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,760
Really think I give a shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit.

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,400
Oh what are you doing?

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,520
I weird in camera dick they are.

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,860
Touch anything sniff at all

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:16,860
You're a bad man! And you made me cry! I hate you!

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,860
You know, I'm an idiot!

31
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,860
You know, I'm an idiot!

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,860
You know, I'm an idiot!

33
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,860
You know, I'm an idiot!

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,860
You've been drinking!

35
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,860
Oh yeah!

36
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,860
It's the MTV!

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,860
It's the DVD!

38
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,860
It's the DVD!

39
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,860
It's the DVD!

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860
It's the DVD!

41
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,860
It's the DVD!

42
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,860
It's the DVD!

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,860
It's the DVD!

44
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,860
What you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard.

45
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,860
At no point, were you even close to anything that could be considered irrational thought?

46
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,860
Everyone in this room is now dumber for having left until it.

47
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
Oh boy.

48
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,860
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

49
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,860
To the next generation radio content in my ears.

50
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,860
We don't need no sticky and crispy.

51
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,860
I like to think I'm flying into this jar.

52
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,860
I'm just kidding!

53
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,860
Hey everybody, how you doing?

54
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,860
It is the Daily Source Code today is the 8th of June 2005.

55
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,860
It was the Wednesday?

56
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,860
It was Tuesday.

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
I don't know, man.

58
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,860
How you doing?

59
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,860
Everybody?

60
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
It's another beautiful day here in Guilford.

61
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,860
It's curry cottage.

62
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,860
It's a little bit later than normal.

63
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,860
It's one, one, 42.

64
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,860
And the source code.

65
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,860
Music heavy today.

66
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,860
It felt like playing lots of cool pod safe tunes.

67
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,860
And I got another hit test, of course.

68
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
Young palette.

69
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Doing his stuff.

70
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,860
How'd you like that opening, huh?

71
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,860
Brand new.

72
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,860
Although it's really old.

73
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,860
It's something I've played a while back.

74
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,860
No idea who made it, but I actually was meant kind of to scorn me.

75
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,860
But I know I kind of dig it now.

76
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,860
Just something new to start it off with.

77
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,860
Getting all kinds of complaints.

78
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
Oh, it's two minutes before you get to actually talking on the shows.

79
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,860
I'm skipping fast forwarding the opening of the show.

80
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,860
Great.

81
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,860
That's what those buttons are for.

82
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,860
And you can find them on the I River.

83
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,860
I have a interesting start of the day.

84
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,860
We're shipping horseback to Belgium to its original trainer.

85
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
Actually, it's being sold.

86
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,860
And there's a lot of difficulty trying to move animals into the UK.

87
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,860
But also out of the UK, it's kind of interesting.

88
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,860
Man, all kinds of forms and documents and stuff that you need.

89
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,860
In health certificates, I think they'd be glad to get one less animal.

90
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,860
Or one more animal out of the country have one less to deal with.

91
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,860
But apparently that is not the case.

92
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,860
As I said, lots of podsake music tunes today on the show.

93
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,860
A couple of promos, a young pull-out hit test, which of course is also always music heavy.

94
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,860
And I'm going to couple of things to talk about.

95
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,860
Got some great feedback to the yesterday show and the show notes and just want to chat with you about some stuff.

96
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,860
But first, an awesome mashup.

97
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Get this party started.

98
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,860
The trip's Nirvana makes on the daily sucks horse coat.

99
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,860
Then on a Saturday night, everybody's waiting for me to arrive.

100
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,860
Sending out the message to all of my friends.

101
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,860
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes-Benz.

102
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,860
I got lots of styles like my gold diamond rings.

103
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,860
I can go from miles if you know what I mean.

104
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm going to couple of things to talk about.

105
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,860

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

178
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

179
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

180
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

181
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

182
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

183
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

184
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

185
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

186
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

187
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

188
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

189
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

190
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

191
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

192
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

193
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

194
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

195
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

196
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,420
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

197
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm going to couple things to talk about.

198
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Party parties.

199
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
I want to y'know you know almost things that Megan said.

200
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,060
New that this was not Pod safe because it kind of...

201
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,380
created a little drop out there to render the entire recording useless.

202
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,100
I got a great email yesterday about that about the dropouts that I've been having.

203
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Now I know it's definitely not audio hijacked pro because it tells you when it's skipped

204
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,260
something when it's had a dropout.

205
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,500
This is the program mega-sag that I've been using on the Mac when I'm not beta testing

206
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,020
cast blaster on the tablet, on the crap-lit.

207
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,220
Ryan Doer sent me a really long, very thoughtful email about the problem was, but the title

208
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,180
of the subject of the emails is, it's not your hard drive, I know I've had it happen to

209
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,180
me.

210
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,940
Here's the deal, it's actually a problem with quick time that is ancient and Apple doesn't

211
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,460
seem to be interested in fixing.

212
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,340
You're experiencing a lock-up of quick time when loading variable bitrate MP3 files.

213
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,500
Mega-sagged loads into quick-time player slots, actually a bit more complicated than

214
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,100
that but just think of each slot as a player in that quick-time player program, okay, I

215
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,580
kind of figure that.

216
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,620
So as a track is playing the next one loads, right, that's what mega-sagged does for me.

217
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,940
If it's in a variable bitrate MP3, the true time of the file must be calculated.

218
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,940
Quick-time is, unfortunately, not performing very efficiently and stops playback to give

219
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,060
more attention to the calculation, this is extremely irritating, not no shit.

220
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,740
And then he has a number of suggestions to fix the problem, of course, I can convert

221
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,100
to AAC or wave files using iTunes and then in Mega-sagged, I need to re-link the files

222
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,100
that I converted and remove the originals.

223
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,660
And then he gives me an email at one of the guys at Mega-sagged who will give me additional

224
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,660
suggestions.

225
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,540
Very cool, thanks a lot Ryan and it makes a total sense.

226
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,220
And if it's really just something that, you know, quick-time needs to fix, let's start

227
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
pitching about it.

228
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,700
It seems to work.

229
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,420
It only didn't even take us a year to get podcasting into iTunes, so maybe we can get

230
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,420
that fixed.

231
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,460
I totally understand what's happening.

232
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,420
It's just like one of those legacy things that lays around, but man, it's really bumming

233
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,420
me out when using programs on the Mac, so, and I know, well, what's his name?

234
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Who's the head over there at Apple of Frank Casanova?

235
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
There you go.

236
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Yeah.

237
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
All right.

238
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
The APB out to Frank Casanova.

239
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,420
Hopefully he'll hear this and we'll take action.

240
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,420
Or at least let us know what's happening.

241
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
It's a daily source code.

242
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,420
My name's Adam Curry.

243
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
I'm trying to do this every single day.

244
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
If you're new, welcome to the show.

245
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,420
If you're subscribed, thanks for subscribing.

246
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:53,420
If you don't know how to, head on over to iPodr.org or podcastally.com, and there's plenty

247
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,420
people who will help you out, or just hold off four or five weeks in iTunes.

248
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
It'll become very apparent.

249
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:09,420
I received another email a while ago from Young Lady Kay, and she was thinking of setting up

250
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,420
a podcasting business, and she and I helped her out with a couple things.

251
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,420
And she sent me the following message, which is really cute.

252
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,420
Adam Adam, Bob Adam, banana, banana, phoat Adam, phoat Adam, phoat Adam, phoat Adam,

253
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Adam, hey, do I have to pay rights for the name, game song?

254
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
I hope not.

255
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Anyway, this is Kay saying hi, and thank you so much from AskMyPod.com.

256
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,420
I really appreciate all the help that you've given me so far, and my RSS feeds are up and

257
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,420
working.

258
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
Thank you Adam.

259
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
You are the pod father.

260
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,420
Woo!

261
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Anyway, I wanted to share with your listeners a little bit about what we do here at AskMyPod.com.

262
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,420
We are a positive podcasting group, and our thing is make them smile, because we think that you can do that.

263
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,420
You can go out, and you can enjoy the hell out of yourself, and help other people do the same.

264
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,420
So visit AskMyPod.com and smile in your day.

265
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,420
Okay, so we have six different shows.

266
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,420
The first one is our feature presentation, and that changes with every episode.

267
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,420
The current presentation is an interview with a happy angel.

268
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Talking about how you can remain happy in a world of adversity.

269
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,420
How do you deal with all that negative crap you've gotten your day all the time?

270
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
Yeah, so far I'm digging this line up.

271
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
Fine.

272
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,420
What can you do about it?

273
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,420
PJKFC is where we interview up and coming bands and new music.

274
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,420
This is all pod safe music.

275
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Again, we currently have an interview with J.D. from Sawser, a really hot band from Toronto.

276
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,420
AskBubb is an advice column.

277
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,420
You write in and let us know what your issues are, and we'll feed that through to Bubba, who works on our

278
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,420
staff here at AskMyPod.

279
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,420
That wouldn't happen to be Bubba the love sponge now, wouldn't it?

280
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,420
And he'll help you figure out your dilemma.

281
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,420
Happy news is where you can tune in, and hear the positive things that are happening around the globe.

282
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Hookup is where we have really nice people, meeting other really nice people one at a time.

283
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Tune in to hookup and see who's available right now.

284
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
That is something you have to hear.

285
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
This is a great line up for shows.

286
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
I'm totally digging it.

287
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Extreme chicks features women who are on the cutting edge.

288
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,420
We have skydivers, secret agents, and all kinds of groovy stuff that we're doing.

289
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
Yeah.

290
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,420
We hope you like our format, and we hope that we're able to help people see things in a better

291
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,420
perspective and go out and make them smile.

292
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,420
That's our thing, and that's what we're trying to do.

293
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
And again, Adam, thank you so much for your help.

294
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,420
I'd like to leave you with us on from the Unrequited Loves.

295
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,420
This is Track One Off of their CD available on our PJKFC website here at AskMyPod.com.

296
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
These are the Unrequited Loves.

297
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Make them smile.

298
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Okay.

299
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Thank you so much.

300
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Congratulations, and may you have many employees.

301
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,420
And you heard their adventure.

302
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
It's a daily source code.

303
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,420
Taking it out too soon.

304
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Yeah.

305
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,420
It's going to be a new music Tuesday.

306
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
Now on.

307
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
It's hard to love.

308
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:56,420
I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you

309
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:26,420
I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've ever heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've never heard of you, I've not heard of you, I've ever heard of you, I've heard too, I've ever heard of you

310
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:33,420
He's all right, he's all right, he's all right, he's all right

311
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:40,420
He's all right, he's all right, he's all right

312
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:51,420
He's all right, he's all right, he's all right

313
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:09,420
He's all right, he's all right

314
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,420
He's all right It's all right, he's all right

315
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Don't be afraid, but you're all the greatest, just after the night it's all the way to the front of the walls

316
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Don't be afraid, but you're all the best, and don't be afraid, but you're all the best

317
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:53,420
Don't be afraid, but you're all the best, and don't be afraid, but you're all the best, and don't be afraid, but you're all the best, and don't be afraid, but you're all the best, and don't be afraid, but you're all the best

318
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,420
Great..

319
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
We've got time here

320
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,900
All right, fucking quick time.

321
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,540
All right, okay, way to go, congratulations.

322
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,460
I was like a great little podcast network.

323
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,860
We should talk, girl.

324
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:23,100
By the way, thanks to JGNLA for the mashup today,

325
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,660
Pink with Nirvana, versus Nirvana, I should say.

326
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,500
Hey, yesterday I said something while I was narrating

327
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,380
the Steve Jobs keynote about, let's see, about an NPR show,

328
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,780
I think, called the treatment, which, of course,

329
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,580
I'd never heard, but just the, I said it was boring.

330
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,500
I didn't say it was boring, but I went, okay, so Steve Jobs

331
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,220
played with the source code and I said,

332
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,620
ask, I said, ask.

333
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,180
And then all the geeks in the house loved it.

334
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,100
And so they got a chuckle, and then the start of the treatment

335
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,300
was, I said boring, but I've never listened to the show.

336
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,180
I show, and but from what I see in comments on yesterday's show notes,

337
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,660
it is awesome and not at all boring.

338
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,740
So I apologize, I shouldn't have said it that way.

339
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,060
Certainly not without having heard the show.

340
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,540
I think I was just talking about what I'm seeing is the trend

341
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,020
that the, okay, so in blogging we had newspapers and publications,

342
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,300
magazines, et cetera, who were saying, well, bloggers are not

343
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,740
journalists, and it seems that with podcasting,

344
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,180
we're going to run into a reasonably similar situation

345
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,980
where the established media is going to say, okay,

346
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,060
we're professional and they're amateurs.

347
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:43,060
And this was very clear from what Steve Jobs said in his keynote,

348
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,580
and I refer back to yesterday's source code to listen to that

349
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,060
with my narration.

350
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,580
I think that a established media can either,

351
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,460
it has two choices really.

352
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,380
When something comes along that really breaks a business model

353
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,860
or is really something that shifts business in a very profound way.

354
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,980
And they can either extend or defend.

355
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,620
And it's interesting because you can also kind of walk in the middle.

356
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,500
You may compromise as in the business all the time for good or for bad.

357
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,140
And I think what the Apple is doing is compromising by saying,

358
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,780
okay, we're extending by offering podcasts

359
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,900
to come into the iTunes world, but we're also defending

360
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,340
by saying, hey, look at all these professionals

361
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,340
who are doing it.

362
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,300
So, of course, they're going to highlight probably one

363
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
to 2,000 professional podcasts.

364
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,220
Now, what is the difference between professional and amateur?

365
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,940
As far as I know, it's just whether you're getting paid for it or not.

366
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,380
It's whether you decide to commercialize that part of what you're doing

367
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,300
and take money or barter and products or something.

368
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,140
That's the only real difference.

369
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,180
It not to be confused with, oh, it sounds professional.

370
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,980
You know, even if you are a quote professional,

371
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,020
which means you're getting paid for doing what you're doing,

372
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,220
you can still be boring or you can be no good or have no talent.

373
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,300
Plenty of that going around in the professional world.

374
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,980
And the same goes for the amateur world.

375
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,940
So that's the only difference.

376
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,900
And actually, I think it's beautiful to put it that way

377
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,380
because once you understand that the only difference between professional

378
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,300
and amateur is getting paid for it or not,

379
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,140
it becomes very easy to see what a tremendous opportunity there

380
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,700
is in podcasting.

381
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,980
So I kind of like that.

382
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,740
Although I listened to Future Tense, which is John Gordon, I think.

383
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,460
He's in Minneapolis.

384
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,940
I don't have a clip.

385
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,140
It was actually, I was thinking of pulling a clip from it,

386
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,980
but it was so long.

387
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,620
It was the CEO of Audible.

388
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:49,500
The place we can download, spoken word, audio books for a fee.

389
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,140
I'm a subscriber, actually.

390
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,300
I don't take enough advantage of my subscription

391
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,140
because they presume that you're going to buy a book every month.

392
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,620
You actually pay for the book.

393
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,540
And I don't think the credits get saved up.

394
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,380
But either way, because they've been at it for a long time.

395
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,620
And I'm a believer in selling premium content as well.

396
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,140
But there, the CEO was kind of defending.

397
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,340
He wasn't really extending.

398
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,900
And what did tremendous opportunity?

399
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,380
He was really saying, hey, these are people with track records.

400
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,620
I'm like, you don't have to be good to have a track record.

401
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,700
You track records start somewhere.

402
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,820
So if I were an investor, I'd think about that.

403
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,980
I don't think the CEO has, he feels, he's definitely defending.

404
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,820
It's a long interview.

405
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,580
Please check it out.

406
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,380
Future tense.

407
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,300
I'll put a link to it in the show notes to the show itself.

408
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,980
He's really saying, well, this is not an iPod explosion.

409
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:49,580
This is not like DVD or we went from $30 million to $350 million sold.

410
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,900
He says that the explosion will happen, but that'll be much later.

411
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,340
And it's just like, man, ride the wave, dig it, you know?

412
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,900
I think it ought to be a perfect place to sell premium content.

413
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,380
And you should be out there scouting and you should be, I think you should be trying

414
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,780
to do deals with podcasters.

415
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,900
Never mind, I'm happy to do it for you.

416
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,580
So you've got a couple of workmen in this week.

417
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,340
There's no, they only work at like four hours, I don't know if that's four hours a day,

418
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,460
but four hours on what they're doing here at the cottage, they're basically fixing the window,

419
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,660
so we don't freeze the death there, doing some isolation, isolation, insulation, that's

420
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,900
what it is.

421
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,180
And so I got to talk about one of the guys and talk about podcasting.

422
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,060
He came up later and he said, hey, I got a question, you know, my cousin has an iPod

423
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
shuffle.

424
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:46,300
And I've got a Tashiba satellite laptop and I want to plug it in, I've got all the software

425
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,500
and everything ready to go, but it seems like his USB plug on the Tashiba is incompatible

426
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
with the shuffle.

427
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,980
I like that doesn't sound right.

428
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,780
I mean, it could be like one of those printer USB cables, no, it wasn't that either.

429
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,100
So he says it just doesn't fit in.

430
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,940
So if you happen to know if that's true or if there's some kind of adapter or, you know,

431
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,060
connector that he can put in, he said it would bring the kid over tomorrow, so I'll take

432
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,260
a look at it, excuse me.

433
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,260
Oh, guess what, that's deadly.

434
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,540
It's T property without a string on the T bag.

435
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,740
It's not the sense, say, oh, today, what else do I want to talk about?

436
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,060
I've got the future tense, I was going to talk about fame.

437
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,460
Yeah, fuck it.

438
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,860
That's, that was related to the audible thing.

439
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Well, I will do that another day.

440
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,140
Today, of course, this new music Tuesday, I've just dubbed it that.

441
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,900
So let me see, where's the rest of my notes?

442
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,900
Crap.

443
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,200
I thought I had the notes for this shoot.

444
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,920
There's no fucking producer.

445
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
What is it?

446
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,660
We're going to play, here we go.

447
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,000
Unsaid band from Dallas.

448
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,340
That's what it was.

449
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,340
Screamin' relax out every time

450
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,340
Call the unit guy

451
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,840
Every time you find your ends in mind

452
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Be get it but you get it from someone else

453
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,340
That this love thing means trust to me

454
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,340
I hear you whisper that you pull the windows down

455
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,840
I try to stop but my odds not stopping now

456
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,840
This is gonna be a tragedy

457
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Please Mother say prayer for me with

458
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,840
To怕 that I gave you secrets

459
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Just get the fake sniff mean time

460
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Show it to me take it waver

461
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,840
You said this night could not surprise us

462
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,840
I made some tape in her eyes

463
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:08,840
You said this night could not surprise us

464
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,840
I made some tape in her eyes

465
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,840
You said this night could not surprise us

466
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,840
I made some tape in her eyes

467
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,840
You said this night could not surprise us

468
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I made some tape in her eyes

469
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:48,840
I don't know if you're interested in the time I've never faced

470
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Just don't know how they should

471
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Just think of it, just think of it, just think of it

472
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
So, I know, just think of it, just think of it

473
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Just think of it, just think of it

474
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Just think of it, just think of it

475
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Just think of it, just think of it

476
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Just think of it, just think of it

477
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Just think of it, just think of it

478
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
And if you're great though, be me

479
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,840
So think of it, just think of it

480
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
Sit down, just make it to be me

481
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,840
I take it down Ceachery

482
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Make me, just think of it

483
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:37,000
They never say everything to me

484
00:26:37,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go,

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's do it, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

486
00:27:37,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not

487
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:30,780
sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, and if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can carry it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can, but I would be fine for this anymore, but I'm not sure whether I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I think I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure.

488
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,180
and perhaps you remember when I was on KFI in Los Angeles,

489
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,820
50,000 watts of clear channel,

490
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,620
humpin' and pumpin' wattage.

491
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,220
But I love your show,

492
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,140
and I wanted to say hi,

493
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,620
and I wanted to tell you that the diamond mine

494
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,020
is going to be back on the air on the internet,

495
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
and as an iPod cast,

496
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,620
and we hope that you'll support us,

497
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,140
we have been supporting you.

498
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,980
Thanks.

499
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:13,220
I've been thinking about things that you probably don't,

500
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,460
wasting time you said just to be definite,

501
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,860
what's the matter with me if you already know?

502
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,940
I'm alone,

503
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,420
sorry me.

504
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,540
I'm waking up,

505
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,700
trying to make something you need to bear,

506
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,340
but we're growing up soon.

507
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,140
Yeah, I might waste my time,

508
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,300
when we're growing up soon.

509
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,300
We're growing up again.

510
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,300
Are you listening to what I said?

511
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,980
Here we are again,

512
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,220
trying to make sense of this,

513
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,020
lost the reason we meant to keep down in the road,

514
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:10,260
on the road suddenly.

515
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,380
We're waking up, trying to make something I need to bear,

516
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,100
but we're growing up soon.

517
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,980
Yeah, I might waste my time,

518
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,220
when we're growing up soon.

519
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,580
We're growing up again,

520
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,220
because we're growing up soon.

521
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,820
Oh, we're wasting our time.

522
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,380
Yeah, I might waste my time,

523
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,380
when we're growing up soon.

524
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,380
Oh, we're wasting our time,

525
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,380
when we're growing up soon.

526
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,380
We're growing up soon.

527
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,380
Oh, we're wasting our time,

528
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,380
when we're growing up soon.

529
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,380
Oh, we're wasting our time.

530
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
Oh, we're wasting our time,

531
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,380
because we're growing up soon.

532
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
Oh, we're wasting our time.

533
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,380
Oh, we were wasting our time.

534
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,380
Yeah, we're wasting our time.

535
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,380
Oh, we're wasting our time.

536
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,380
I'm thinking about parking your second bath,

537
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,380
then you're thinking about looking out.

538
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Yeah, it'd be a such a perm.

539
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:47,140
Have I told you recently how much I enjoyed doing this? Oh man, what an awesome song

540
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,340
Podsafe of course throwing stones by tourists from Vancouver. They see their

541
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,860
listed on garageband.com. Of course links all of that in the show notes at today's

542
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,820
show. Before that was the band from Dallas, Eudacuz and his name is their name.

543
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,740
Red Light's a title that song, man. We should do this more often. We should do a

544
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,660
new music Tuesday every other day of the week. We could do a new music Tuesday on Thursday

545
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:16,740
every one of you. Oh yeah. Man, it's not often. Actually, I got to bring up iTunes here

546
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:22,420
because this is I didn't prep this. It's not often that you get an endorsement from somebody

547
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:31,860
that is so honest and so beautiful. But yesterday I got, it's time to light away the match.

548
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,380
Got an endorsement from Chris Rockwell from the Daily Download. That's the show that he does

549
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:43,540
it's a poop cast basically. Whenever he, it's time for him to go to the bathroom. He calls

550
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,500
that a studio and he takes his gear in there and he listens to it. By the way, the best time

551
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,900
in place to listen to this podcast is when you're poop casting yourself, of course. That

552
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:58,020
really gives you a monomono connection. And so Chris was talking about the work that he's

553
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:05,940
doing with Podsho and I just wanted you to hear it because you know, you know, when a guy is

554
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,580
taking a dump, he can't lie. It's like you're concentrating on it. It's about it.

555
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,860
Here we go. Life, you guys kind of hang in there, but life just got really busy and I just needed

556
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,300
to get, you know, caught up on a lot of things in my life and a lot of projects that I was working on.

557
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:30,020
And, you know, just to give me some time to where I could come back and get back. Yeah, it's pretty

558
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:35,620
down in the groove. All right. He tells us what you've been speaking of grooves. I have a brown fish

559
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,340
working its way out of mind. So let's get into the studio. See, there he goes. He's walking into the

560
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:46,100
studio. Sounded a little hollow and I'm not sure if I've screwed up something while I was away

561
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:52,100
or maybe my head said it's just a little funky. But anyway, last night for dinner, I had him and they

562
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:59,220
sell it. It's been pretty gassy today. So I'm not really sure what caused that. Maybe I had a

563
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,900
soy bar. Oh, that morning for breakfast. That'll do it. And that sometimes will do it.

564
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,940
That's a breakfast of that. That's for us. Well, so much to talk about.

565
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,900
I've received this. Let's see. First off, I wanted to talk a little bit about what I have been

566
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,820
up to. I've been working on a music database for Adam Curry's company, Pod Show. It's going to be a

567
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:27,060
really cool resource for podcasters, hooking them up with great indie artists. It really cool.

568
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,540
I'm not a very good programmer. I'll let you know that now. I love hearing that. Thank you very much.

569
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:40,660
Thanks, Chris. Keep on going, buddy. But I'm really happy with the direction this is going

570
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:46,980
and the vision that these guys have. Everybody talks about the corporations getting into podcasters.

571
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:54,580
No, so you know he's not lying because you can't lie when you're doing this. Oh, yes.

572
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:05,300
Oh, here comes. Oh, man. Anyway, my favorite part of the show. Even though, you know,

573
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:13,380
there's people seem to be against the pod show idea of becoming corporate. These guys really

574
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:22,340
have some great vision and really see more than just money. The whole money, you know, money to be made.

575
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,860
It's more about the community to be made. So really impressive. I'm really impressed. We're

576
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:33,060
working with these guys. Well, let's see what else have I been doing. So anyway, thank you very much,

577
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,820
Chris appreciate that that endorsement. And yes, that I was listening to this in the gym. Yes,

578
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:46,100
I've been for the second time already. Please, to take note of that. And during that piece,

579
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,820
but then also a little bit later on, I was laughing my ass off and people were like, oh, dude,

580
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,380
what's he up to? It was very, very funny show. I'll link to that, of course, in the show,

581
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,060
no, to be interested in hearing the whole thing.

582
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:08,020
Question one. How can all it become rich and famous? Question two. What's the meaning of life?

583
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,420
Question three. Where can I find a fun weekly trivia quiz podcast?

584
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:22,420
The answer to at least one of these questions can be found by visiting www.podquiz.com.

585
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,700
That's www.podquiz.com.

586
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:32,980
Yeah, was it? Of course, there is truly only one pod quiz. It's, you know, what it is?

587
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,940
Podquiz. What are you casting with Adam Curry?

588
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,740
Three, two, one. It's time for the interest with John Poeh.

589
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:46,740
Yeah, come on. Hey Adam, this is another hit test number 42 to be specific. And this one is also

590
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:53,780
recorded with cast blaster bed of 14. There's not much to tell about anything right now. So let's start with

591
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,580
the intro right away. This is intro number one.

592
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:05,380
Okay, easy one from movie flash dance, Michael Sunbello with Maniac.

593
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,060
And this is number two.

594
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,300
Okay, also easy for the MTV guy.

595
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,700
That's her burning by Midnight Oil.

596
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,580
And the final one is number three.

597
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:34,420
Oh, so my favorite. Van Halen run in with the devil. I think I got three for three today.

598
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,660
Fantastic. And you probably heard the Gmail sound. I just got a million from Mike

599
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,380
cast blaster Mike. No time for that right now because we're busy with the hit test. You're such a good

600
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,180
beta test. We're the intro. So this is answer number one.

601
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,180
It's an only Michael Sunbello. This is Maniac.

602
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,380
One point for the easy Michael.

603
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:44,500
From 1983, answer number one, Michael Sunbello. And this is answer number two. Midnight Oil.

604
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,180
That's our burning.

605
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:05,620
Hold and relax and buy with these awesome steam and party five degrees.

606
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:14,900
Patricia hates this guy. Thank you for singing. He has sex when I look his turn.

607
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:31,220
Midnight Oil. Answer number three.

608
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,700
This is the final answer. It's Van Halen and run in with the devil.

609
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:54,180
My life back there's no tomorrow. Yes, I'm living at our place like you.

610
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:15,220
One in with the devil Van Halen is answer number three.

611
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,220
Okay, and I'm a bit sit for a hit test number 42. As always, feedback is welcome and hit

612
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:27,300
test at gmail.com. And you can find the information about the hit test at yompolit.com,

613
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:34,340
the J.A. and B.O.L. E.C. dot com. And also check out the hit test podcast on the same site.

614
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:39,140
But thank you for listening. See you next time. Bye bye. All right, John. Thank you very much once again.

615
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,420
That sounded really good coming from the cast blast. And you want to figure it out that somehow

616
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,260
something's out of phase in my sound card. And people leave that shit.

617
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,780
Okay, and normally I'd stop the show right here, but this is the new music Tuesday. So

618
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:59,940
gotta play something sent to me by the potentate of pod safe. That's what Peter wants me to call.

619
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,660
I think it was the high priest, but a potentate apparently is higher than that. Make a few

620
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,660
in mind, it's orange park.

621
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:42,660
And this was the song that I miss. Do you think I'm making it? Do you want me to make it?

622
00:41:42,660 --> 00:42:02,420
No, to sound, I think I'm your mind. Do that way, start it, make I'm your mind. Do that way, start it.

623
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:14,420
Someone said to me, look what I just found. No one's come in clean. They never make a sound.

624
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:22,420
I see you falling with this, what's the song that I miss? Do you think I'm making it? Do you want me to make it?

625
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:44,420
No, to sound, I think I'm your mind. Do that way, start it, make I'm your mind. Do that way, start it.

626
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:58,420
I always never wanted you to change your mind. The time that follows more and it needs you up and time.

627
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:09,420
I'll take back all the things that you were making, but I'll say goodbye, you say goodbye.

628
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:27,420
No, to sound, I think I'm your mind. Do that way, start it, make I'm your mind.

629
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:39,420
Do that way, start it, make I'm your mind. Do that way, start it, make I'm your mind.

Do that way, start it, make I'm your mind. Do that way, start it, make I'm your mind.

631
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:10,420
Songs from the unknown, make up your mind, orange park on your daily source code, man. The music business really messed it up when they thought that, you know, by not letting us play their music on podcasts that they were doing the right things.

632
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:18,420
Stupid, look at all the exposure, we're giving it these great new bands, I love it.

633
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,420
That was fun, hope you enjoyed it, a little heavy on the guitar side of everything, but that was kind of the vibe I had today.

634
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:34,420
So I'm glad I could share that with you, hope you didn't fast forward through too much stuff, links to all of the songs and the promos that I played today are in the show notes, find those at dailysourcecode.com

635
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:49,420
You may want to leave a comment, you can do that at www.curry.com, or email is always welcome, don't expect it to be red.

636
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:58,420
I'm really trying to fish out the good ones, though it's very tough. Do you may able to do it a great job for me, Adam or Curry.com, and audio comments, also welcome here.

637
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:11,420
For promos, anything else you want to send me, submit at podshow.com, and send podsafe and podshow.com for podsafe music, and mash up, mash up at podshow.com.

638
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:30,420
Alright, that's it. I've got a lot of show notes to do, so for those of you who are wondering, I don't edit the show together, I basically do it all on the fly, just one take recording, and when I mess up, hey, there you go.

639
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,420
If I don't mess up, I'll do that.

640
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:43,420
Okay, so the podcast feed, of course, is a deadly source code.com, I think of this custom, or something else I was going to say.

641
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:50,420
Anyway, Patricia actually said, yes, they say, hey, it's time we do another podcast together, don't you think?

642
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:55,420
Trying to get it, taking care of, that should be fun.

643
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,420
I'll be back tomorrow for the Wednesday edition of the Daily Source Code.

644
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:05,420
You're listening to whatever you want to, just enjoy. Take care everybody. Bye.
