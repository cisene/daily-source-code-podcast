1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Tell us, you're a Charlie, two, five, four.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Please save me from people who've been told what to like and then like it.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,160
In my opinion, if you're over six years of age and you're still getting your music

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,760
from the radio, something is desperately wrong with you.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,440
I can only hope that somehow MP3 players and file sharing will destroy FM radio the way

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,920
they're destroying record companies.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,720
And even though the air will probably never be safe to breathe again, maybe it will

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,920
be safer to listen to it.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,920
I don't see rats.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm sorry, information you don't get higher.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm Korean.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,920
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
We don't need no sticking greens in.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,920
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
And we've hit the hump by friends.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Today is Wednesday, October 5, 2005.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
And good morning from Curry Cottage.

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,920
It is just barely still morning five minutes before 12.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,920
I was up early, really excited when I woke up this morning.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
I just woke up.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,920
I had a whole bunch of ideas and things to talk about, about pot-safe music and music licensing.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,920
And I was really excited.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,920
I started going through the email and how much crap hit me, which we'll talk about, which

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,920
maybe has to do with directories in the potter.org and podcastallie.com.

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
So we will be talking about that.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Then of course, I had something really important, which was go off to the hair salon.

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
And of course, it's not Sam and Dave.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
We're a Tony and Guy.

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Whatever the hell those guys named it.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
No, I know God too.

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,920
I go to Patricia's hairdresser and she goes with me.

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Since I have to take my glasses off and can't keep control over what's happening.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
You know, I am so lucky.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,920
I am blessed with what I have for 41 years and still a full head hair.

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Yeah!

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Oh, that enough is just to be happy about it, isn't it?

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
We've got promos galore.

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
All kinds of new promos, even from some shows

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
that have been around a while.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,920
It's nice to see that got some new stuff coming.

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,920
And actually, there's a lot coming in now, which is great because if we have a slow day,

43
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,920
I'll know I have plenty of stuff, excuse me, to pull from from the archives.

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,920
And it's all about getting exposure for more shows, right?

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Podsafe music.

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,920
I think I've got probably a time to roll out two of those and some great feedback on this

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
music licensing stuff.

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,920
This is really just hitting me.

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,920
I turned everything upside down on the world with a hell of a lot better when I did that.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,920
So we will get into that with a little bit of hiccups from the Mac, which we're still working on.

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,920
First though, we have a mashup from mashuptown.com, ArtSent this one in.

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Romantic is the new fantastic.

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
The groove blaster.

54
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,920
This one's feel else to me.

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm so happy with it.

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,920
But you can stay if you want to.

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Check it out now.

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Check it out now.

59
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:24,920
I've been thinking about this in life.

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,920
I might just stay here with you tonight.

61
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Check it out now.

62
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Music

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Ladies and gentlemen, this break is made out of respect for the TV fans, our audience.

64
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:44,920
We're considering to constant interruptions in their programs for messages and sponsors.

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,920
We want all you TV fans to see the whole and not forget the thrill you get.

66
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Come on.

67
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,920
How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you?

68
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Black girls.

69
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Not like you're not wicked up to no good.

70
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Have a kill anyone?

71
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Because I bet you could tease a man to death without having to try.

72
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
You told him to kiss me.

73
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Ladies, I know he was going to kiss you.

74
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
I want to send a boy to do a man's job.

75
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Oh, that's for the man.

76
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
You can tell him the job's filled.

77
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Check it out now.

78
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Music

79
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:11,920
That's like that's nice.

80
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Welcome.

81
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,920
This is the podshow podcast network.

82
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
It's the Davy source code.

83
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,920
After this, you'll get Mads Weinstein on a true attention tech.

84
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,920
We've got pdubs, half hour friends.

85
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
We've got podsake music all coming up in the next four or four hours.

86
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,920
If you're checking this out on the podcast, well, you are truly wired.

87
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,920
So, as I said, this morning I woke up.

88
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I was so enthusiastic about stuff that I'm still enthusiastic about about podsake music and podsake music network and music licensing.

89
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
We're going to get to that.

90
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:59,920
But first, I want you to know that for the past, I think two weeks now, we have been completely consumed at podshow.

91
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Part of it when I was still in San Francisco and part of it this week with listings in our directories.

92
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Now, just so you know, podshow owns and operates two domains, and I'm saying this very specifically domains.

93
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,920
We have indiepodder.org, formerly known as iPodder.org.

94
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
We have podcastalley.com.

95
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Two directories where you can pretty much submit your podcast and have it listed.

96
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Now, there's very distinct differences between these two domains and what they do and what their function is.

97
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Let me start with indiepodder.org first.

98
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,920
This started as a community resource back in the early days before there was actually a word pod casting.

99
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,920
And it's a brilliant system, brilliant.

100
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,920
And I can easily say that because I'm just going to sit down for a second for this one.

101
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
I love the stool, I still have here.

102
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,920
The main reason it's brilliant is because it's architected as an open distributed directory based on OPML.

103
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Huge props to Dave Winner for his vision of how this works.

104
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
And boy, I'd actually love to hear him weigh in on this.

105
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Although I think that he's going to agree with me.

106
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Wouldn't that be a great.

107
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:25,920
The nature of a distributed directory means that indiepodder.org really is no more than one page if you.

108
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
It's not a database.

109
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,920
There's no database sitting behind that it's one page which is an HTML rendering of an OPML.

110
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,920
That means that there's a bunch of links in that OPML file, which is just a format.

111
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,920
So it's just a file, see it as a regular file with a bunch of links in it.

112
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:49,920
And those links point to other OPML files hosted on other servers by other people, which are maintained by those people.

113
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Now what's beautiful about this is it's actually a very democratic system because although indiepodder.org,

114
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,920
the main page there and the top level of directory may be seen as the all encompassing top level.

115
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,920
It's actually quite cool because you could take the entire file we make that available for anyone.

116
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Apple did that and other companies and many other directories, of course, have pre-populated their directories with that data.

117
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
And we make no claims about that.

118
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Go ahead and grab it.

119
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
There's a link right there.

120
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
We explain very clearly how it can be done.

121
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,920
But just to reiterate.

122
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Sensei.

123
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Just to reiterate, there's no database, there's no storing of any links other than the links to these other directory nodes.

124
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Now what the system does do and this does add to some confusion.

125
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
We're going to work on that is it renders.

126
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,920
So if you say I want to look at the automotive category, you click on that link.

127
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,920
What the system is actually doing is saying, okay, let me go pull in that OPML file from another server.

128
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,920
And I'm going to render that through our rendering engine to turn it into an HTML representation,

129
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,920
which is why you basically get just a bunch of links to RSS feeds, which is many of said is, you know,

130
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
that's not the way to do a directory.

131
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Well, it in fact is the way to do a directory because it is a complete resource.

132
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
It's just a resource.

133
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Do you hear that?

134
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
That's my blackberry.

135
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,920
That's the one thing I do not like about the blackberry is it provides a lot of interference on the equipment here.

136
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
The MDA does not do that.

137
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,920
So I have to kind of find the right spot so I can still read my show prep on it and not have that sound crappy.

138
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Anyway, so we are quite happy to point to anyone who wants, that's why you see it's kind of funny.

139
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,920
People say, well, you've got way too many top level links there.

140
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,920
When someone says they have a new category, we bought it in.

141
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Well, I'm happy to put anything in the top category.

142
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,920
If there isn't a category that it already fits in, I'm happy to put it there.

143
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,920
So for instance, we have a politics node right now.

144
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,920
If someone decided they wanted to do an alternative politics node and was different from the one we already have,

145
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
they would probably get a top level listing for me.

146
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,920
But again, it's just a link to whatever they're linking to.

147
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
So very much like a weblog.

148
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,920
In fact, it's kind of the two different sides of the same coin in a way.

149
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Where I have a weblog and I can point to someone's website,

150
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,920
but I'm not really responsible for everything they link to.

151
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
And nor do I have the time to go and read everything.

152
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,920
You would presume that if God damn that really pisses me off.

153
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
There we go.

154
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,920
You would presume that no one has time to go and read through everything.

155
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Maybe I would disagree and I could perhaps remove a link.

156
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,920
But the whole kind of idea of the links on the web is that a link is in place and you hope it stays.

157
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
And we don't want a link rot and we want it to kind of be in place.

158
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
So it's very, very critical to understand.

159
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Crucial really that any potter.org is nothing.

160
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
There's no not a database.

161
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,920
It is just a list of links to other lists of links.

162
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,920
That is the nature of the open directory.

163
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,920
By the way, anyone maintaining a node can also.

164
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
And that's not only can they.

165
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,920
I hope they do and many do such as the music category.

166
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,920
There's one music maintainer of the category.

167
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,920
And that person has linked in other opium nodes to what I call sub directory.

168
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,920
So there's someone is maintaining under the music category.

169
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Different like the rock music category.

170
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
And that's actually that can be someone else.

171
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
And it all kind of flows together.

172
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
And it's a different system.

173
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:45,920
It is, in my opinion, the only way an open directory can work because in this case we have over a hundred volunteers.

174
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,920
All of them, you know, so passionate about what they do that they often even hand code these opium

175
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,920
files in like note pad, you know, just to just to get it up and running.

176
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
And of course, that also means that we sometimes have breakage, you know, from day to day.

177
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,920
You'll see that maybe a node will drop out because someone's web server one away.

178
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,920
And we usually wait and see if it comes back.

179
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,920
And from time to time, someone will say, hey, this node hasn't been maintained for six months.

180
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I'd like to take over the node.

181
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
I think they can do a better job.

182
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Then I'll have an email conversation with the original maintainer of the node.

183
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Most of the times the maintainer of the nodes says, oh, shit.

184
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,920
I didn't even know that, you know, I've been updating somewhere else.

185
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,920
And I screwed up and they fixed it and everything kind of seems to cope with Saturday.

186
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Because the people who usually want to maintain a node are the ones who haven't been able to get listed.

187
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,920
By the way, to get listed in a node on indie potter, you communicate directly with through an email or submission link.

188
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Actually, you communicate directly with that node manager.

189
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:50,920
So the way the only way that works is that the node managers are responsible for what they link to.

190
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Okay, that said, let's look at podcastiley.com.

191
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
The name itself says what it is.

192
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
It's the alley behind podcasting.

193
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
It's kind of the back end.

194
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,920
It's where we figure where we built, where I didn't, where Chris McIntyre built a community around podcasters.

195
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,920
And the community focus on a number of different things.

196
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,920
You know, primarily how to create shows, make shows, produce shows, create feeds.

197
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:29,920
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that really the community has created in that space at podcastiley.com.

198
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Now, podcastiley.com does have a database and it has an automatic submission.

199
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,920
So you send it into one place and it basically just all goes in.

200
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,920
It's verified to see if your feed is valid and that's about it.

201
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,920
So what is the issue at hand?

202
00:15:49,920 --> 00:16:02,920
The issue at hand is that a couple of podcasts have popped up into these directories in the past couple of weeks that the majority of people find offensive.

203
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:12,920
One is a hate podcast and one is a podcast apparently about Peter Felia.

204
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:21,920
And these both of these podcasts were listed in both directories in indie potter.org.

205
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,920
It was listed in a node maintained by a separate node manager.

206
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,920
And I can't speak for the new issue that is popped up because I haven't been able to find it in any of the nodes yet.

207
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Nor is anyone pointed out to me.

208
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,920
It did, by the way, pop up automatically on the homepage of indie potter.org.

209
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Both of these podcasts were submitted to podcastiley.

210
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Now, as you can understand, again, it's an automatic submission.

211
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,920
There's sometimes there's a hundred to six or seven hundred new podcasts coming out in a day or in a span of a couple days.

212
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,920
And there is no human intervention there, which I think places a much bigger responsibility on the community.

213
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,920
And primarily the people who run podcastiley.com, which is Podshow.

214
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:15,920
And Chris McIntyre as the spiritual leader of that community and of that website.

215
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:30,920
So the question that has a risen is, should every single podcast be listed in these directories regardless of what the content of the podcast is?

216
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:40,920
This is not the official Podshow statement, but I was so emotional about the conversations that have been going on on podcastiley.

217
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,920
Because it's become very, actually hateful and very aggressive.

218
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:53,920
The way people are attacking Chris, myself, Podshow, other members of the community about this issue.

219
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I think the conversation is just no longer a grown-up conversation.

220
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Let me state right up front that our organization, which is its own little community, a very young and growing community, because we're all just kind of getting to know each other.

221
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,920
We've only been, you know, a company for, for really a few weeks and, you know, new people coming on every single day.

222
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,920
We are very diverse group.

223
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:38,920
And I think it intuitively, you can probably figure out that not a single person in our organization would endorse any type of hate or any, any crime or violence or anything that would potentially hurt children.

224
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
I mean, that's obvious.

225
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,920
This is not, I repeat, this is not a free speech issue. I really thought about this.

226
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Free speech means the right for someone to say whatever they want to say.

227
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:59,920
That doesn't necessarily mean that we have to promote that or link to it or highlight it or list it.

228
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
I'll take it one step further.

229
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Since the podcast Ali.com community is owned and operated by all of us, not just Adam Curry and Ron Bloom or Chris McIntyre, but, you know, it's pod show.

230
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,920
And it's, and that takes significant resources. It takes people and takes money and, you know, there's, there's a, a lot that goes into it.

231
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Chris actually said it very, very, very suit yesterday. He feels that anything on podcast Ali.com basically reflects what we are as people and I totally agree.

232
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Because we do maintain the database. We do maintain what is being linked to, we do maintain the listings.

233
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Indiepoter.org, that homepage, that, that, that top level listing, that reflects who we are as people.

234
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,920
The linking, and this is really, really, really important that you understand this.

235
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,920
The linking to other OPML files, which, in fact, are a little mini directories.

236
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,920
We cannot be responsible for what other people put in their OPML files.

237
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,920
We can't tell a node manager to put something in or take something out.

238
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,920
So, and again, we're going to write this down and come out with an official statement.

239
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:24,920
And, you know, words are always turned around and I'm not always the best communicator, particularly not when I'm emotional, but I want you to know that the only way to solve this is to put our foot down and say that we have the right.

240
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:32,920
We reserve the right to not list a podcast if we feel we don't have to or want to.

241
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,920
See, that already didn't come out the way I wanted to sound.

242
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:45,920
But we reserve the right to not list anything on podcastally.com and on the homepage, the top level of the indiepoter.org directory.

243
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,920
In fact, the, one of the offensive podcasts through automatic script showed up on the homepage of indiepoter.org.

244
00:20:52,920 --> 00:21:04,920
And I removed it because that is my space. That is the space that I control and that is owned by pod show and the community of people who do not want anything poorly to reflect upon us.

245
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Anything else in indiepoter.org should be taken up with the maintainer of that node.

246
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,920
And by the way, we, of course, do reserve the right to drop a node or place it with something else.

247
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,920
But that's where we have to be really, really careful, my friends.

248
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:29,920
The way we're going to release our policy, if you will, will be exactly that.

249
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:38,920
If you have an issue with a link on an independently hosted and maintained node, you'll have to take it up with that node manager.

250
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:47,920
We are only linking to nodes. If nodes are properly maintained, that's all we care about, that the links work.

251
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:56,920
And that they're updated fresh and that they're, you know, that they're maintained basically and people can get their stuff listed in it.

252
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:05,920
So I think you will see that the offensive quote unquote offensive podcasts will be removed from podcast alley.

253
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,920
At the same time, we will also, I think, be looking at members of the community who are offensive.

254
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,920
And we might have to remove them because if this has this discussion or what people are trying to call discussion,

255
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,920
podcast alley.com is not the place for it.

256
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Because we're trying to create a positive community that works towards podcasting, creating better podcast.

257
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,920
We don't, I don't think it's the right forum for a huge free speech discussion because it's inappropriate.

258
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Free speech would mean that we tell these podcasters that they can't do a podcast.

259
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Okay? So be very, very, I want to be as clear as possible about the distinction that anything we own,

260
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,920
we reserve the right to remove things and we will.

261
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,920
And I think the reasons will be clear, but we don't have to even give a reason if we don't want to.

262
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:09,920
What I'm so emotional about, though, is the tactics that have been played out in this without even any consideration for time,

263
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,920
for thought, for the resources, for the consequences that go into this.

264
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:25,920
And people are blackmailing us, people are sending emails with half truths and sometimes lies to mainstream media to try and quote,

265
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,920
quote, stir the shit up or call us out.

266
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,920
You know, it's a completely wrong way to go about it. It is so incredibly disappointing.

267
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Anyway, how, what time are we now?

268
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,920
God damn, never gonna make this show.

269
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,920
So today at the California hasn't broken up yet, it'll be a few more hours yet.

270
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,920
We're going to publish our policies. You'll see that they'll look very much like Google.

271
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,920
And by the way, you know, threats were made to our investors.

272
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,920
They're very aware have dealt with this before have been giving us some excellent advice on the topic.

273
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,920
And we're trying to be as mature as possible about this.

274
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:18,920
So we can move on and get on with creating great podcasts, better podcasting and a thriving community that does not yell, shout, and threaten each other.

275
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Okay, now for some fun stuff.

276
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Hi, this is Apocalypse Dahl. I'd like to tell you about my podcast novel, Brace for Impact.

277
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,920
This novel follows the story of Apocalypse Dahl.

278
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Hey, that's me. And Mick Aloha, my arch enemy.

279
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,920
As we join forces to journey across the country for a common cause.

280
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Along the way, win counter truckers, pro wrestlers, robots, ghosts, sex craved middle-aged Japanese women.

281
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,920
In saying farmers, a plot to destroy the internet and midget cowboys.

282
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,920
New episodes come out every Tuesday. You can check out the website at www.freepodcastnomel.com

283
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,920
or do a search for brace for impact in the directories. Thanks a lot.

284
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Hot show. Content that will make you squeeze the dog and burp your mother.

Want to hear something different?

286
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Want to hear how South Africans are doing it?

287
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Well, I'm Glenn.

288
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,920
And I'm Bridget.

289
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920

Come and experience Cape Town, South Africa.

291
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
We talk about anything.

292
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,920
But not for cons. It's such an expressive language.

293
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
But in Africa, you can't just say four.

294
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Oh, close. Come on, South Africa.

295
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,920
And we talk to interesting people.

296
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Going to break the landscape record for the fastest blind driver.

297
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,920
All I'm going to find is close to possible in the end of the moment now.

298
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,920
So come and join the Zee Cape Townian.

302
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,920
And James.

303
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Yes, we have a big interview on Friday show at madpot.com.

304
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Barry Manolo.

305
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,920
That's right. Barry Manolo and madpot.

306
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,920
And I floated down, made it into a ballad.

307
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
That's what he was hearing.

308
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,320
Hearing me doing it is a ballad and it was the first number one song for me and for Arespa.

309
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,160
Oh, my singing mandi.

310
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,120
Mabpa.

311
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Doc Call.

312
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Sing mandi.

313
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
There you go.

314
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,720
The ultimate mannel L.

315
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,120
And an extremely rare interview.

316
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
This is only one of six and ten years.

317
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,120
Mannel L.

318
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,720
Speaks with Shadow Steel.

319
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,320
Regarding his hits, entertainment career and personal life.

320
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,440
Mabpa.

321
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,320
Doc Call.

322
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Hi.

323
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,320
This is Shadow Steel and you're listening to your global audio connection, madpod.com.

324
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Doc Call.

325
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Yeah.

326
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Shadow Steel or whatever.

327
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Baga.

328
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
That's a district or trucker name.

329
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,320
I think there are 25 Shadow Steel's running around the country right now.

330
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
But it sounds interesting.

331
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
I definitely want to hear the Barry.

332
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,320
I like Barry Manelow's stuff.

333
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Let me think what I'm going to do now because I don't think I'm going to happen.

334
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,320
I mean, I'm going to remove the track I was going to play here.

335
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,320
I'll play that tomorrow so we can get into the music licensing conversation.

336
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Okay.

337
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Where to start?

338
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,320
I think the easiest and most logical place to start is to talk about, oh actually.

339
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Yeah.

340
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,320
It's to talk about what music licensing is, how it came about.

341
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
And I'm a semi-professional in this area.

342
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
I'm certainly not a lawyer.

343
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
Certainly not a music lawyer.

344
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,320
But I have dealt with the material long enough to get the conversation.

345
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Going a little bit more.

346
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,320
And this is purely about podcasting and radio and streaming and the digital Millennium Copyright Act.

347
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:20,320
So historically radio stations have been able to play records on the radio at no cost other than a contribution to Ask Cap BMI.

348
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,320
And if you're in a different country like the Netherlands, it's Buma Stemera.

349
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,320
If you're in England, it's the PMRS, I think it is.

350
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,320
These are all territorial based organizations.

351
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,320
And a little fuzzy on this.

352
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:43,320
But I believe they have acquired the right from the government to be the collection agency for authors, composers.

353
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,320
And there are actually two separate organizations that I think are in some places.

354
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Well, there are separate organizations that actually got and collect money for the producer.

355
00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Of a song as well as for the vocalist of a song.

356
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Believe it or not.

357
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
I know this because Patricia gets them.

358
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
It's called the Sainat in Europe.

359
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,320
And they actually got and get money for the for the vocalist, even if they haven't written the song.

360
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,320
So the concept behind this is that the record companies who own the actual product.

361
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Okay.

362
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,320
So the product of a song, which is it's the disc that it comes on.

363
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,320
It's the complete, it we call it the master.

364
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,320
You know, basically in 99.9 cases when you have a record deal.

365
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
The record company owns the master.

366
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,320
That means they own whatever happens with that physical product and how it is used.

367
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Traditionally, radio's record companies have waived any fee.

368
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
I've said, go ahead radio stations.

369
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,320
You can use this because it promotes our product and it helps us in our entire marketing campaign to sell the physical product.

370
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,320
So that's a great hand off and an up until streaming, which I get to in a second.

371
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
That was a very cut and, you know, very cut and straight cut deal.

372
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Everyone understood it.

373
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Now, of course, radio stations who play music and music is not just, you know, the number one hit of the week,

374
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,320
but it can also be a filler that you use or some background music during an interview or all any type of music.

375
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:22,320
Just as with clubs, restaurants, bars, elevators, concerts, anywhere that the music is performed.

376
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Okay.

377
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
And by performance, I also mean broadcast.

378
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,320
So it is, it's not that you're just putting a record on and playing it for your friends.

379
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
And there's, there's actually some legal language about that.

380
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
What constitutes the real performance.

381
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,320
In fact, you've probably seen that there's all kinds of disclaimers that if you buy a direct TV,

382
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,320
satellite dish and you have all your buddies come over and you, if you were to charge money at the door,

383
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,320
if you just let anyone in and a hundred people watching the game, you could get a knock at the door,

384
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,320
and they could start charging you money for that.

385
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
But think about it.

386
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,320
You know, if you're in a commercial venture, such as Radio Station, you're using this art,

387
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,320
which, of course, the record companies aren't getting compensated for directly,

388
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,320
but the people who created the song, they need to be compensated.

389
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,320
They're partially compensated through sales, and there's a whole division key of that,

390
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,320
who gets what, and that all depends on, you know, the publishing rights,

391
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,320
and, you know, that's probably a little bit too complicated to go into in depth here.

392
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,320
But that's why there are these organizations, and they've been around for a long time,

393
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,320
like BMI and like ASCAP and PMRS and Bumush Damara.

394
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:36,320
And their job is to cut deals with all of these places where the music is used in a commercial,

395
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
and a commercial venture.

396
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,320
So a radio station will typically pay a percentage of revenue,

397
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,320
I think it's, they based it on audience size and revenue,

398
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,320
but it's all negotiation is what it is.

399
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,320
In fact, we did a trade show recently, that recently, when I was still back in,

400
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,320
at the Curry Castle, for Grandmaster View screens, we did a trade show,

401
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,320
and a guy from the local ASCAP BMI authorities came by and said,

402
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,320
hey, you're playing music here, do you have a license?

403
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
And we said, no, we don't.

404
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,320
We thought that was included with the stand and, you know, with our booth.

405
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,320
No, sorry, you got to pay, and you have to pay right now,

406
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
or we'll send you, we'll find you.

407
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,320
And it wasn't much, you know, they based upon the size of the booth,

408
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
and with the traffic that was going by the booth, you know,

409
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,320
it's all kind of fuzzy logic and math, but it's, you know, it's fair.

410
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,320
We're using music to attract people into buy our products.

411
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,320
I mean, maybe we'll pay like 50 bucks or something per day,

412
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
for the week that we were there.

413
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
So, you know, it's, it's, it's fair.

414
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
It just makes sense.

415
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:50,320
So, taking into consideration that history will repeat itself,

416
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,320
I think we need to do something similar for the pod safe music scene,

417
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,320
and particularly through the pod safe music network.

418
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Because often, even though often the,

419
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,320
the creator of the song of the product that you can either buy,

420
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,320
yeah, a protract download, or that you can buy as a physical CD,

421
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,320
even though they may also be the songwriter and composer at the end of the day,

422
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,320
when someone is making money, and I've already heard this conversation crop up,

423
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,320
you know, if I'm making money through doing the daily source code,

424
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
which I'm not making directly yet, but we will eventually,

425
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,320
there's going to be some kind of sponsorships and advertising,

426
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,320
or so there's going to be some monetization.

427
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,320
And if I'm using music to do that, then the people who created that music

428
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,320
should be fairly compensated, and the people who are selling the product of that music

429
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,320
will be compensated if it's good enough, and it catches on,

430
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,320
and people go and buy the product.

431
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,320
So, I do believe that we have to come up with something for the pod safe music

432
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:59,320
authors, composers, producers, and let's just say performers, okay?

433
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,320
And that's a huge job to set that up, but it's really going to be worth it.

434
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Let me just tell you how they fixed that with streaming,

435
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,320
because when streaming came out in the late 90s,

436
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,320
radio stations, essentially radio stations in the beginning,

437
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,320
were a simultaneous feeding of their radio station,

438
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
so you could pick it up anywhere in the world.

439
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Of course, you were tied to your computer, so it didn't have all the benefits of pod casting.

440
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,320
But this also adheres to the satellite radio,

441
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,320
that all falls under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

442
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,320
And if you read this act outside of the, you know,

443
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,320
all the stuff about cracking encryption, et cetera,

444
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,320
it was a freaking negotiation.

445
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,320
And it literally says things like,

446
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,320
you can't play a song by the same artist back to back,

447
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,320
because, of course, they're afraid that you'll eventually, you know,

448
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
that you could play all 12 of a CDs tracks,

449
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,320
and someone could record that, and then they would effectively have the CD.

450
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,320
It was really a negotiation with people,

451
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
with big radio stations who were into streaming,

452
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:14,320
as well as the then still infant and not even open for business satellite radio operators.

453
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,320
So none of this really applies to pod casting

454
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
when it comes to the traditional system,

455
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,320
which means licensed music, which belongs to the RIA,

456
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
and of course, the songs themselves,

457
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,320
which belong to the authors, composers, producers,

458
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,320
and performers on the track.

459
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,320
So that's the problem with playing songs that aren't pod safe in your podcast.

460
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,320
The problem is that there is a collection agency,

461
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,320
and their mission in life is to go out and collect money

462
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,320
if you're using the works,

463
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,320
not the physical product, but the works of these artists.

464
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Again, the composer, the writer, the producer, and the performers.

465
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,320
If you're using those works in a commercial venture,

466
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
and of course, what's commercial is very fuzzy,

467
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,320
but at the end of the day, if you're making money using that product,

468
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
they'll come and collect.

469
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,320
So that's why you see ASCAD BMI coming out with licenses for podcasters.

470
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Because they're saying, hey, this is very clearly defined.

471
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,320
If you have permission to use the master to use the product,

472
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,320
then all we want is we want to fairly compensate these other guys over here.

473
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
Totally agree with it.

474
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,320
Of course, the way they've set that up,

475
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,320
the size of the fee, the reporting you have to do,

476
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,320
is nowhere near possible for any podcast.

477
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
I can't even do my own frickin' show notes myself.

478
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Let alone do all the work on figuring out.

479
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,320
And we used to do this at the big radio stations before it was all automated.

480
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,320
You have to write down, title the song, the artist, the label it's on,

481
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,320
and then on the record is always stated who's the composer,

482
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,320
and who is the author, producer,

483
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,320
and performers don't apply,

484
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:15,320
and those rights start to be collected much later on.

485
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,320
So while we could really focus on getting a license with ASCAD BMI,

486
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,320
which is kind of what I was talking about the other day,

487
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,320
I think maybe we should turn the tables and turn it around.

488
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,320
And before I get to that, I want to play for you,

489
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,320
kind of a, it's a promo, but it's kind of a joke,

490
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,320
because, and by the way, it's completely not safe for children's ears.

491
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,320
These guys totally understand the vibe of the record companies,

492
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,320
the RIA, because they would probably sound a lot like this

493
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,320
if they were trying to deal with us podcasters.

494
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,320
We've been checking out this pod safe music network a year.

495
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,320
We like what we see. You know what I mean?

496
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Look, we've got a deal for it.

497
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,320
I think it's going to work out pretty good for all of us.

498
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
We really see it, baby.

499
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
What the fuck?

500
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Who else is fucking Frenchy in here?

501
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
I don't know.

502
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
What the fuck?

503
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Joey, take care of the fucking Frenchy for me, would you?

504
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
I got it.

505
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
Forget about it.

506
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Where the fuck was I before that French fuck in a ruptuous?

507
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Look, we don't let just anyone into the family.

508
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,320
I think it's about time we make an exception.

509
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
See, it's a thing.

510
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
We got ourselves a business back into Troy.

511
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Go ahead, boat and sing music studios.

512
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Yeah, yeah. We pretty much run the whole town down there.

513
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Joey, shut the fuck up.

514
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Look, we got some talented people recording there.

515
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,320
We like to see if we can make a deal with you.

516
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Go ahead.

517
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
You can take a head of that.

518
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,320
Look, we'll get you some good music for your pod safe music network.

519
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,320
And in return, you just tell them where you got it.

520
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,320
It's as simple as that.

521
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,320
What do you think?

522
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Well, first of all, we got the really good shit.

523
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I mean, all this music, top notch.

524
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,320
And second of all, it's a really good fun.

525
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
You know what I mean?

526
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
The shit rocks.

527
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Forget about it.

528
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Joey, shut the fuck up.

529
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,320
So, what do you think, Adam?

530
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,320
We got ourselves a deal.

531
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Oh, man.

532
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
Piece of crap.

533
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
I think that was the end of it.

534
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
So you kind of get the gist there, right?

535
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,320
So he was my thought.

536
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,320
And by the way, I clearly like to play mashups,

537
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
and that's an issue.

538
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
And I'd like to pay for that.

539
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,320
And if I want to, and if we can come to terms with AskCADBMI,

540
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
or PMRS, or whoever it is,

541
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,320
we'll gladly do that if there's money coming in, of course.

542
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,320
You know, the people who created that work deserve to deserve to have that.

543
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,320
By the way, you know, this is the entire reason why copyrights are extended,

544
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320
and are extended primarily by artists.

545
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
Members Sonny Bono did that.

546
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,320
And Cliff Richard is bitching and moaning over here,

547
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,320
because most of his copyrights are about to expire,

548
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,320
which means basically, you know, he won't get any money

549
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
for what he created.

550
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,320
And you know, so that's, I shouldn't even brought that up.

551
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
That's a whole different conversation about expiration

552
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
of copyrights.

553
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,320
But what we can do here.

554
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Here's what we can do.

555
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Podsafe Music has happened.

556
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
There's no doubt about it.

557
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
I get emails all the time from people who say,

558
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Dude, I heard, I heard Brother Love on this other podcast,

559
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,320
and I recognized it just like it was a,

560
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,320
you know, a regular radio station

561
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
that I'd heard it somewhere else in a,

562
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
and it felt like I hit to me,

563
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
and I was loving it and singing along,

564
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
because it's working.

565
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,320
You know, we are promoting these artists.

566
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
It's really, really working.

567
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,320
So I think that I would like to investigate the Podsafe Music network,

568
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
being a clearinghouse,

569
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,320
not for the actual product again,

570
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
not for the, for the track that's being sold.

571
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
If that's played on your podcast,

572
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,320
I feel that that should be, you know,

573
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
that's a wash, you know,

574
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
it's a promotion for the product,

575
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
but we are using the works by these talented artists,

576
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,320
mostly talented artists.

577
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,320
And if you're monetizing,

578
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
if you're making money,

579
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,320
then you should,

580
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,320
these people should be compensated.

581
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
So I think there's a way to do that

582
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,320
and have the Podsafe Music network

583
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
be a clearinghouse for that.

584
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,320
And it will be so cool because it's already happening now

585
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
where radio stations want to play

586
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
some of this Podsafe Music.

587
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
Well, it's not interesting.

588
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
You have to cut a deal with the podcasters,

589
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,320
music association or whatever the hell we're going to call it.

590
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Well, the Podsafe Music network

591
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
writes clearances.

592
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Yeah, we'll use all the big words those guys use.

593
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
So you have to clear it through us.

594
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
And guess what?

595
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
If you played on terrestrial radio,

596
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
you have a different rate,

597
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,320
and it's going to be much higher than on podcasts.

598
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
If you want to use it with your film,

599
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
then you also have to come to the clearinghouse.

600
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,320
I would love nothing more than to represent all these artists.

601
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
And again, not just the author and composer,

602
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
but the producer and the performers of the work,

603
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,320
so that when someone uses their work,

604
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
whether they re-record it,

605
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
it doesn't make any difference.

606
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,320
If it's being used in a commercial venture through a performance,

607
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,320
then I think that should be compensated,

608
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
and I think we can do it.

609
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,320
In fact, I got an audio feedback from Adrian Pegg here in the UK,

610
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
who said something very similar.

611
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Listen to what he has to say.

612
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
I don't know if this is Adrian Pegg.

613
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,320
I was one of the four organises of the recent Podcastcon UK conference.

614
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
I was interested to hear about your attempts

615
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,320
to solve the music licensing issues in Podcasting.

616
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
I mean, I actually think that Podcast

617
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,320
have found a real niche anyway with indie music

618
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
and unlicensed side music,

619
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,320
because that is something that the major broadcast

620
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,320
this content wouldn't want to do anyway.

621
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,320
And it really gives Podcast something different.

622
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,320
But I can see why it would be nice to have

623
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,320
a blanket license of some sort to play a license music

624
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,320
or sign music.

625
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,320
And I think the approach of going to the approach of avoiding

626
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,320
the mechanical rights side of things initially is a good one.

627
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,320
But I do think you could think about taking it

628
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,320
at one step further.

629
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,320
Imagine that you could get the odd small record label signed up

630
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,320
with mechanical rights,

631
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,320
and you were actually acting as a collecting agency yourself.

632
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,320
Pod shows acting as a collecting agency.

633
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,320
You could actually bypass the whole process.

634
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
I know it would be a lot to set up,

635
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,320
and it would have to really depend

636
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,320
I suppose on there being significant revenues

637
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
to share out.

638
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
So that might be a little way off.

639
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
But in the end, you know,

640
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,320
what we need really is a global system in any case.

641
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,320
I mean, one of the problems that I have

642
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
with things you've been talking about

643
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,320
is that they are effectively confined to the US.

644
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Pod is, for example, in this country,

645
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,320
it would be the PRS, the Performing Rights Society,

646
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,320
that you would need to be discussing with.

647
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,320
And in fact, as I understand it,

648
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,320
these things are territorial based,

649
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,320
not about where the show is hosted

650
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
or effectively broadcast from.

651
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
So in fact, you know,

652
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
your discussions with ASCAP BMI

653
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
wouldn't even apply to your own show

654
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,320
because you obviously produce that show

655
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
for the most part in the UK.

656
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,320
Or even if you did a territorial blanket agreement

657
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,320
with ASCAP BMI,

658
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
you would actually be excluded from it.

659
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,320
So what we need really is some kind of global system

660
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
a global blanket license,

661
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
so we don't have to worry about territories.

662
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,320
And that's why I think it might be worth

663
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,320
podger thinking about something slightly further reaching

664
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,320
than a deal with ASCAP BMI.

665
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
And if that going back to the artists themselves

666
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
and doing a deal, setting up a separate

667
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
collecting agency even.

668
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
And the other thing I wanted to say

669
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,320
was that as far as the million listen to March goes,

670
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,320
I wanted to let you know that he's far too modest

671
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
to tell you himself,

672
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,320
but podcast pool at podcastpool.com

673
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
who, as you know, is a lawyer in the UK,

674
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,320
and also an organizer of podcast.com UK.

675
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Has been asked by the BBC on Radio 5 Live

676
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,320
to do his pod lawyer podcast

677
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,320
and put that out on National Radio in the UK,

678
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,320
which is also available to international listeners

679
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,320
through the BBC listen again player.

680
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,320
So that is undoubtedly going to be a

681
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
good move towards getting more listeners

682
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
to podcasting.

683
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
And Radio 5 is being very, very supportive

684
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
of the whole medium at the moment.

685
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Anyway, thanks again, sorry I rambled

686
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
and I love the show.

687
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Keep it up, thanks.

688
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Thank you very much, Adrian.

689
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
Really appreciate it.

690
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
And of course, congrats to podcast,

691
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Paul, he did tell me that.

692
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,320
I thought I had mentioned it on the show.

693
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Of course the BBC is happy with that.

694
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,320
He's doing it for free.

695
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,320
That's great exposure.

696
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
Great exposure for him and for podcasting.

697
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Love that.

698
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
So to wrap this up,

699
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,320
here's what I'm going to propose internally at pod show

700
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
because I think this is a great opportunity.

701
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,320
I would like the pod safe net

702
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
with music network to invest

703
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,320
and to become that clearing agency.

704
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,320
And here's the first steps we could take.

705
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,320
If you're a member of the network,

706
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,320
then I think that the benefit in your podcaster,

707
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,320
the first step we could take is,

708
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:38,320
okay, we will make sure that,

709
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,320
let me think about this.

710
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,320
We will make sure that the collections are done

711
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
for podcasts who are monetizing

712
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
and using pod safe music.

713
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
And it will be a fraction.

714
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,320
It'll be small.

715
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,320
It'll be freaking pennies, okay?

716
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,320
But millions of pennies

717
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,320
starts to become interesting for anybody

718
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,320
and I think eventually we're going to go

719
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
in that direction.

720
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
There's no doubt about it.

721
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,320
If a radio station or television station

722
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,320
or some mainstream media wants to use the music,

723
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
sure, no problem.

724
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,320
But you have a very different rate.

725
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
We're talking dollars there.

726
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,320
Not pennies.

727
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
For, you know, ten cents,

728
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
ten cents or dimes or whatever.

729
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,320
We'll figure that out.

730
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,320
And it will take significant resources.

731
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
It will take work,

732
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,320
but I really would love to invest in that

733
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,320
because I think that's how we fulfill

734
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
on George Carlin's dream.

735
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,320
And that's how we turn the tables.

736
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,320
And I'm pretty sure,

737
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,320
if we can succeed at that.

738
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,320
And we really are bringing the listeners in

739
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
because we've got exciting new music

740
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,320
and tons of it and lots of diversity

741
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
that, you know, the mainstream media

742
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
will want to play this.

743
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,320
And they'll want to be a part of it.

744
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,320
I mean, it's there.

745
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,320
It's the fuel that makes radio stations.

746
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Music radio stations run is the music.

747
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
They're all pulling from the same

748
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,320
one and a half million songs

749
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
that you can download from iTunes

750
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
or from Rhapsody or, you know,

751
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
whatever other system you,

752
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
you may be subscribed to where you buy your music.

753
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
Everyone's, and they all say it.

754
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,320
It's a million and a half songs.

755
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,320
That's all that is no more songs than that.

756
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
Well, we know that's not true.

757
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
So I'm going to work on this.

758
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
I'm going to keep you updated.

759
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,320
But I think that as podcasting starts to move,

760
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
not all, not all by the way,

761
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
if you, if you have a non-commercial podcast,

762
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,320
you should be able to use the music

763
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,320
under almost like a creative commons license

764
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
where you don't have to pay anything

765
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,320
for the privilege of using it as long as you report it.

766
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
But if you do and people will

767
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
and we're helping with them with that

768
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
with monetization,

769
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,320
then we're going to pay the artists

770
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
who are part of this.

771
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,320
Okay, I'm sorry for the rant.

772
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,320
I didn't get to all the songs I wanted to play.

773
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,320
I didn't get to have the promos I wanted to,

774
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,320
to put before you.

775
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
We'll do that tomorrow.

776
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Thanks for listening.

777
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Bye-bye.
