00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,080
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-5-1 Please save me from people who've been told what to like and

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,720
then like it.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,080
In my opinion, if you're over six years of age and you're still getting your music

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,680
from the radio, something is desperately wrong with you.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,400
I can only hope that somehow MP3 players and file sharing will destroy FM radio the way

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
they're destroying record companies.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,720
Then even though the air will probably never be safe to breathe again, maybe it will

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,800
be safer to listen to.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,960
Hi everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code Sunday.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,520
Today's October 2nd, 2005 special source code today.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm back home.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Hello.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Hello darling.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,560
This is not good to have you home.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Thank you dear.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
This is a horrible.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,840
The studio is not set up for this.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
Are you the base?

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Why?

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Because you're looking at my ass.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Oh yeah.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Well that's nice.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,840
I've been thinking about it all the time and now it's there.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Uh-huh.

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Oh yeah baby.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,320
Do you remember?

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
What the ass?

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
Not the ass.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Oh.

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Yesterday when I came home.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Oh.

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
I Christina, how are you?

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Look at her face.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
What?

35
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
More to five.

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
More to five.

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
That's how you get her out of it.

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
So you get her out of the studio.

39
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Yeah.

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Goodbye.

41
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Bye.

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,320
So I've been gone for like two and a half weeks.

43
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
We're back.

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
That was long.

45
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
That was a long time.

46
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Yeah.

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
That part sucked.

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
That part sucked.

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Yeah.

50
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
It was really quiet though.

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Although.

52
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,320
I think it's always nice to, you know, to just be a part for a while.

53
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,320
And then when you come home, it's so much fun.

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
That's true.

55
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
You know, it's, it's so happy.

56
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I'm so happy to see you then.

57
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Well also when we're together then we're, it's like 24 hours because I never leave

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
that.

59
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Well that's it.

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
That's it.

61
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
You always hear.

62
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
I'm always here walking around on my bathrobe.

63
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Yeah.

64
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
That's not true.

65
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
No.

66
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
No.

67
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Sometimes.

68
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
I live it too long.

69
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,320
But now I could spend a little bit more time with Christina.

70
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Yeah.

71
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
And you know, which is nice.

72
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Yeah.

73
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Because you ask, you always ask for a lot of attention.

74
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
No, I receive.

75
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
I don't ask.

76
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I don't ask.

77
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
But yeah.

78
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
But you do that in a sort of sneaky way.

79
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Okay.

80
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Yeah.

81
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
So we were talking.

82
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
At first of all, that was the legendary George Carlin from his latest book.

83
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
I love him.

84
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Yeah.

85
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
What the hell?

86
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
It doesn't say here.

87
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Someone sent me this.

88
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Yeah.

89
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
It's he has a new audio book out, which I got from audible.

90
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
But this is like, when will Jesus bring the pork?

91
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
I think is the name of it.

92
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
But it's so true.

93
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
And the Patricia, I've been talking about pot-safe music for a while.

94
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,320
We always talk about music actually because it's our main interest.

95
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Yeah.

96
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Yeah.

97
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Yeah.

98
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
And it can be enjoyable.

99
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
It can be very irritating.

100
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,320
But in a meanwhile, it's entertainment.

101
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Oh, it was last night that we were watching X-factor.

102
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Yeah.

103
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Sharon Osborn, Simon Cowell, those two.

104
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Right?

105
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Is that a person?

106
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
No, it's just those two, right?

107
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
No, no, no.

108
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
And the other one.

109
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Who's the dude with the orange beret and the green and blue blue?

110
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
I don't know.

111
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
That was just a...

112
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
He's a he's irritating.

113
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Yeah.

114
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,320
I think that was a special guy.

115
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
I think so.

116
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,320
The X producer or a music authority that helped her.

117
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Because they all have categories that they take care of.

118
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
What?

119
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Absolutely.

120
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
No, that's the other guy.

121
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
That's what you mean.

122
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
From the X-factor, that's the other...

123
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
His name is Louis with the beard?

124
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
No, no, no.

125
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
It's not with the beard.

126
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Yeah.

127
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
They're the three of them.

128
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Right, but I want to hear the dude with the beard.

129
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
No, I don't know.

130
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
It's an English thing.

131
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
But he's an American.

132
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Oh, is he?

133
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Oh, maybe he's famous here.

134
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
I didn't get it.

135
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
But I know.

136
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
But I know.

137
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Yeah, but I know.

138
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
He's in a music authority.

139
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
That's why he was sitting there.

140
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
But anyway.

141
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,320
So we were at one point when Pope Idle started in the Netherlands.

142
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Three years ago, two years ago.

143
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Yeah.

144
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Some things maybe three years ago.

145
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Yeah, three years ago.

146
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I was asked to be the host of the show, which I declined.

147
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,320
But I said, look, if you don't put Patricia in as a judge, you're crazy.

148
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,320
And of course, I was right.

149
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
It was not that big.

150
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
No, no, but you...

151
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
I should have chosen me.

152
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
But you would have loved doing that.

153
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Well, they thought it was a bit too much.

154
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
You and me.

155
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I did...

156
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
I declined anyway.

157
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
It doesn't matter.

158
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
That doesn't matter.

159
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
But you would have thoroughly enjoyed doing that.

160
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Because you do know a lot about music.

161
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Well, not just music, but performance and styling and the whole packaging.

162
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,320
And also, I can always predict when it's something.

163
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
When it's something, when someone's going to be hit, that's right.

164
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Do you have a coat on?

165
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
My girl's going.

166
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
My very girl.

167
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Be very careful.

168
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,320
For bad English man.

169
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Be careful.

170
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Get your credits first.

171
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Be on time, eh?

172
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Okay.

173
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,320
And don't eat that old crap.

174
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Hey, and don't eat all the crap.

175
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Yeah.

176
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
So, throughout...

177
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
On the food core.

178
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
On the dogs.

179
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
This is ruining our show.

180
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Oh, it doesn't matter.

181
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
No one cares about the show.

182
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
It's real.

183
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
I just want to say that.

184
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
No one cares about the show.

185
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
The dogs don't know.

186
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,320
So, during the week on the daily source code,

187
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,320
which I might point out Patricia never listens to.

188
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
That's probably better, by the way.

189
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Um.

190
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Overdose of anime.

191
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Yeah.

192
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I play all bunch of, you know, whole bunch of pod safe songs.

193
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,320
And songs that I think, you know, that I like or, you know,

194
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
I think I can pick them too, actually.

195
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
I guess that's what I'm saying.

196
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
But Patricia has, you know, she'll look at someone and say,

197
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Oh, that person has it.

198
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
That person has the X factor in fact.

199
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
That's, uh, that's what you can exactly say now.

200
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Yeah, it's just it.

201
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
But also it.

202
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
It.

203
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Right.

204
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
The it factor.

205
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Yeah.

206
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
So when I'm playing tunes here in the studio,

207
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
which is right next door to Patricia's studio.

208
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
My Padua.

209
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Yeah, Padua.

210
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Yeah, Padua.

211
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Sometimes she'll come in and say, I like that.

212
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Yeah, come running in and say, Oh, I like that.

213
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Yeah, who's that? Who's that?

214
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Beautiful.

215
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
So I figured I just play a couple of, uh,

216
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,320
uh, a couple of the songs that I've been playing in the past week.

217
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
And then you, you, you tell me what you think about them.

218
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
You like you, you like the idea?

219
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Good.

220
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Okay. So I'll put it on the speakers in a second so you can hear a little bit better.

221
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,320
This first one is, uh, Natalie Brown is called in my dreams.

222
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Even though we said goodbye, quite some time ago,

223
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:30,320
there's a strain of loving my heart.

224
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,320
That just came and let you grow.

225
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:44,320
It seems that even when I go to sleep,

226
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,320
images of you, my mind's still clear.

227
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,320
And I still see you in my dreams.

228
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:04,320
No matter how I try it seems,

229
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,320
that it depot of me just can't forget.

230
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,320
That it depot of me still has a request.

231
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:27,320
And I can't seem to let all the love I had for you grow.

232
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Yes, I still see you in my dreams.

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Sometimes I wait with your face in my mind.

234
00:08:48,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Somehow I thought that I'd left those memories behind.

235
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,320
It seems that you have left my heart frustrated

236
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,320
with vivid memories of your smile clear.

237
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,320
That just came and let me dream.

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,320
No matter how I try it seems,

239
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,320
that it depot of me just can't forget.

240
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,320
That it depot of me still has a request.

241
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:53,320
And I can't seem to let all the love I had for you grow.

242
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:00,320
I still see you in my dreams.

243
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Yes, I still see you in my dream.

244
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Okay, that was not the brown in my dreams.

245
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
What is her name?

246
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Natalie Brown.

247
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Natalie Brown.

248
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
I'll tell you something about her here.

249
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Yeah, I don't think she is brown.

250
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
No, in fact, she is very white.

251
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Yes, she is.

252
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,320
From the pod-set music that we're biopathes,

253
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
there's little chance that you'll hear Natalie Brown sing or speak,

254
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
and not be moved by the refreshing texture in her voice.

255
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,320
This emotive singer songwriter with a soulful and powerful 4.5 octave range

256
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,320
translates her life experiences into songs that inspire entertain and provoke.

257
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Well, what do we have here?

258
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
It's another Mariah Carey.

259
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Yeah, that's Mariah Carey.

260
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
But I thought actually kind of nicer than Mariah Carey.

262
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
How sweeter?

263
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Yeah, a little bit more sweeter, very warm, very sensitive.

264
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,320
It really grabbed me.

265
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
The song?

266
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
No, it's a little bit.

267
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Goes on a little bit too long.

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,320
It's like one of those early, it's like one of those early Whitney Houston songs.

269
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Yeah, exactly.

270
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,320
I was thinking about how I was thinking about how I was thinking about her voice.

271
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
But her voice?

272
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
I don't know how she looks if she has the looks.

273
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Yes, she's got huge hudders.

274
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Oh, that's always nice.

275
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
No, I can.

276
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
That's too far away.

277
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
But that's always nice, you know.

278
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
It helps a little bit.

279
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,320
But.

280
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Yeah, okay.

281
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
You need something.

282
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
We should make that a tag on the podcast.

283
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,320
But her voice is, I think, very she's, she's, she's got a totally on the control.

284
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Yeah.

285
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I like that.

286
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
I don't know if she really, if she stopped somewhere and they, you know, did it in part.

287
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
But the way it sounds.

288
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
I mean, the recording.

289
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Yeah, the recording.

290
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
I don't know that.

291
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Interesting.

292
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
But it sounds very, very clear.

293
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
But it doesn't matter.

294
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
It doesn't, I mean, even if you record it that way, that's okay.

295
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Well, it matters if you sing live and you cannot do it the way you recorded it.

296
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
It's a bit of bummer, of course.

297
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
No.

298
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,320
But it sounded, I like her voice.

299
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
I like her voice very much.

300
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Beautiful.

301
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Very warm.

302
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Very sensitive.

303
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
And she sings with her heart.

304
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
I can tell.

305
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Yeah.

306
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
The song is a little bit too weepy too.

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Yeah.

308
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Yeah.

309
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
All right.

310
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
So the chords you sung for an album.

311
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
So we should keep our eye on her then.

312
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Yeah.

313
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Definitely.

314
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Good.

315
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Okay.

316
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Let's play a guide then.

317
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Lee, three Harris.

318
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
I don't know when I play this.

319
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Oh, shit.

320
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Okay.

321
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Okay.

322
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Okay.

323
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Okay.

324
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Actually, I kind of like this one.

325
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Nothing to believe it.

326
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,320
You got MTV and VH1.

327
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
And I'm on planet in Nickelodeon.

328
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,320
And a net and a satellite dish and a big tanker,

329
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Dr. Go Fish and a, you don't have this word you whisper.

330
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Nothing to believe in.

331
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Nothing to believe in.

332
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Got a pretty girl friend and a big big car.

333
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Everybody knows your name at the bar.

334
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Call that a designer sneakers.

335
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,320
There we go with fancy speakers.

336
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
We don't have just what you deserve.

337
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Nothing to believe in.

338
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Nothing to believe in.

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Right here's right.

340
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
When you say you're so.

341
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Nothing more to do.

342
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,320
When you know to learn all that's to fade in.

343
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,320
And ain't gonna say you ain't gonna say you.

344
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Books and books are found in the shell.

345
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Down on the corner.

346
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,320
There's a taco bell.

347
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Nothing to believe in.

348
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Nothing to believe in.

349
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Nothing to believe in.

350
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Nothing to believe in.

351
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Hold on.

352
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,320
That's some of all the things that an American guy needs.

353
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I love the words.

354
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I love the words.

355
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
I think it's a great song.

356
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
I love it.

357
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Yeah.

358
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Absolutely true.

359
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
What are you singing?

360
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
What do you mean by that?

361
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Well, we've been there the last time.

362
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I noticed exactly what he was singing.

363
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Yeah.

364
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
The sneakers.

365
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
We've got this one.

366
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
That's also the other side.

367
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
The emptiness.

368
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
That's actually the Lee Harris III.
