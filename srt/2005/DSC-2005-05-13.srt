1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi everybody welcome to the daily source code. I'm going to do a little different type of show today

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,840
Actually, when you're here in the background is a

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,680
What do you call out a mix down of one of the pod shows for serious running in the background?

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,520
Have all the computers running at the moment and got a kind of a tight schedule today. So I didn't want to

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
You

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,320
I'm recording on two machines and I've got another machine that's queuing stuff up and

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,360
I figured well instead of waiting for it all to be done. I just grabbed the iRiver grab the the love microphone and

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,720
Actually, it's a beautiful day in in Gilford

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,160
This it started off kind of windy and cold this morning. I think the wind is still still there

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,400
But it's so beautiful and this whole week I've been indoors working my ass off

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,040
Yeah

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,080
Sitting in here smoking up a storm. Yeah, sure the windows are open and and and that you know

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
I got a lot of fresh air coming in but I've been in this

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,080
Well, I call it the studio, but it's really a converted bedroom work. No, it's not even converted

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,920
It's a bedroom without a bed. It's a bedroom with a desk and you know got my stuff over here. You know what what's really cool this

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,120
You know, I'll just turn this up for a second

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
I was doing

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,080
Probably can understand it very well, but that's the four one one podcast and

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,200
Doing an interview with Senator John Edwards about his podcast. I did I'd mentioned that on a previous source code

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
And accidentally actually said John Kerry

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,160
Well, that would have been too smart if he was doing a podcast I guess now John Edwards and his wife Elizabeth do a podcast

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I think I've only done too so far

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,360
But it's really good and I'll put links in the show notes of that and the interview which is done by a Skype

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,720
It's awesome and he really knows what the hell is going on and he listens to podcasts and

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,360
It's really it's it's good stuff, you know, who would have thought that

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,480
In less than a year we would have senators not only knowing what podcasts are but understanding the

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,560
The community and and also able to to do one themselves is very very exciting stuff

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,240
So uh, let me see so we'll go outside we'll go out for a walk on the downs

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
Let me just do

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,320
Set everything up here. I want to make sure my wires don't hit my my microphone continuously

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm gonna grab the

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Hello, let me just take a look at the

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,400
At the crap let because I had a couple of things I wanted to mention before I have a piece of paper with some notes which I'll take outside

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
I just wanted to mention a couple of things here

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,720
This is by the way a sound seeing tour and you know

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,640
I get a lot of email people talk about two different things and and I guess it's because I'm not pronouncing it correctly

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,480
Or I guess it just kind of sounds it can sound like I'm saying sound

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,680
Seeing as an SE and E whereas I've always said sound seeing

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,120
So sound seeing tour is where you know you narrate the environment and walk around shit the sun just went away

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,080
Okay, I'll have to pronounce jacket. Okay, two bits of interesting news that came in today on email

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,520
See who's this from this is a message

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,680
From

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,120
Saro a secari arrow from Finland

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,600
Adam just want to tell you that I received reply from

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,400
Uncy von Yokee of Nokia's multimedia division

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,840
He said that inside Nokia they are eye-podding like crazy, which is good news because

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
To me that means that

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,960
Nokia or Nokia which of way one pronounce it is

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,600
Is thinking about this and that's great. You know and I've had conversations with them too

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,280
So I'm really happy to see that that's moving along and this was kind of a frightening

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,440
Kind of a frightening email that I got we're not really frightening but finally a statement from the RIA about the

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,080
Legalities and licensing of podcasts

53
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,440
This came to me from

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,560
Sarah Sterlin who is a

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,280
reporter for the national journal and

56
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,680
She got an official position a statement from the RIA about podcasts. I'm gonna quote here

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
I'll let me just turn off this

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
You just turn that off for a second

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Here we go

60
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,920
So it doesn't say who said this at the RIA but the quote is

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,160
We are always supportive of new and exciting ways for fans to discover and experience music

62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:57,520
Podcasters like the uses of any other sound recordings must obtain the appropriate licenses from the copyright owners or their

63
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
Designese

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,880
Appropriate licensing is an important part of the legal system set up to protect musicians songwriters songwriters and copyright owners

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,760
Podcasts are downloads and as such do not qualify for the statutory licenses that are available to

66
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,200
webcasters, simulcasters, satellite radio and other digital transmission services

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,360
Wow, okay, that's it. Be careful what you're doing on your podcast because

68
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,640
They definitely have a position and they're right. I know of course they can't really have any other position

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,360
on that

70
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
So I'm walking

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Down the stairs studios

72
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
up on the second floor

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Let me sit in here. I'm going to grab a coat

74
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
I don't think I've actually taken you out in the backyard have I?

75
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,480
Okay, hold on I have to go back up I forgot my

76
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
sunglasses

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Which is uh

78
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Wishful thinking

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Okay

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,040
So for those of you oh wait a minute now the mic is kind of covered up on my jacket when they pin this up a little bit higher

81
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
There we go

82
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Right there, okay

83
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,520
This is not the oh so the for those of you there are always emailing me and asking me about my setup

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
This is not the

85
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,920
stereo griffin microphone because it's windy outside and I don't still have a windscreen for that thing

86
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,760
So this is the the wireless set

87
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,400
Which I have the the transmitter on my belt and I have the receiver part in my pocket

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,520
I think can do probably like half a mile but I'm sure the four inches

89
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
difference between the two will be just fine

90
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
okay

91
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
No, let's try this again

92
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
You can hear the cat's bell

93
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Is that you ginger?

94
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Hey ginger, hey baby

95
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,080
You want to come outside for a walk this cat is amazing he's an orange orange colored cat and

96
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
He's just like a dog

97
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,120
He's a stray who walked up to the

98
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
The castle when we still live there in Belgium

99
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,480
Never one away here go baby

100
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
He's always hungry

101
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,960
Is it good?

102
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
Is it good?

103
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,640
So he's so funny because when you go out for a walk you'll come along and they'll walk along with you like a dog

104
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
Welcome for a walk

105
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,400
I was kind of stupid. I guess the fed him of course is not gonna come for a walk. Okay out the back door

106
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Oh

107
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
It is still kind of windy

108
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
So the way the cottage is situated

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,000
We have a really decent sized backyard

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
Surrounded by trees if you walk all the way to the back

111
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Gosh, it's nice today. It's really nice and sunny if you walk all the way to the back

112
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
There's a gate

113
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,600
And if you walk through the gate which I'm coming. Oh, by the way, there's a we have a bomb shelter

114
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
In the backyard want to go on the bomb shelter with me. I'm gonna put my notes away

115
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
This was built in the second world war

116
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Let's see if I can open it up

117
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
It's a two-person bomb shelter

118
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,200
Which is kind of weird because we have a five bedroom house

119
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
I guess some people just want to support me now

120
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
It's covered up

121
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,240
Shit for the second world war it's hard to get into hold on. Okay. I'm gonna

122
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Go down now

123
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
I have to kind of duck to get in

124
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I should have brought a light

125
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Let me see what's my lighter

126
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Oh shit

127
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,240
Okay, she's in the animals there

128
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Bring me out

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Okay, so here we are

130
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Light still in the good home

131
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
There we go. So here it is. This is a chair and

132
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
As you can tell from the acoustics

133
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,280
We're underground in a tunnel kind of the construction. It's um we call this this is uh

134
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Like some kind of

135
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720
It's all concrete. It's built into the ground. It's entirely made of concrete and it has that

136
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,240
Round roof structure so it can stand the forces of whatever's above it

137
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,320
And

138
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Yeah, it's basically just

139
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,960
People in the second world war when there was an air raid and

140
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,560
There was lots of air raids over the UK

141
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,680
Then you know the silence would go and you'd scurry down in here and you'd sit here

142
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,920
And uh sometimes the neighbors would come in and have to sit with you and uh sometimes the people would be here for hours or maybe even an entire night

143
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
It's kind of funky to think about that

144
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,680
But again very very small I guess this was uh only for uh for the privilege for you who had enough money

145
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
of resources to have this type of

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
This type of shelter right near their backyard right right near their home

147
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
So

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,520
All right

149
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Pretty boring otherwise so let's go on out again

150
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,440
Climb it up all right. Hey Jess

151
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,200
That's Jesse a big dog. Hey Jess

152
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Wanna come for a walk

153
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,880
Let's cover it up again the reason why it's covered up is otherwise

154
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
All kinds of varmin might get in there

155
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
And

156
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,040
We have plenty of foxes

157
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,280
Well the perfect den for a fox but not really what you want

158
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
So here I am back at the

159
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
the gate

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And now

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,160
From here close the gate

162
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,080
We're walking through a

163
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
A little bit of woods here into

164
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
The open field

165
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,400
Known as the downs and the downs

166
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
I really don't know all the precise history

167
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,240
But basically from where I am and gulford

168
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,560
The gut the down stretches all the way down to the coastline

169
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
It's just hundreds of miles of

170
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
Open field with trees

171
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Sometimes is line the the borders of it and

172
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,440
What it's used for mostly is for people walking

173
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,680
Walking with their dog and also horse riding

174
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
Because you can

175
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
But Christina's pony is

176
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,600
Located I don't know five minutes drive down the road

177
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,760
So what's that like what 10 kilometers 8 kilometers

178
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Yeah about five miles I guess four five miles

179
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,240
And I can actually drop her off there and then she'll show up

180
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
Right at the backyard when her horse for a cup of tea

181
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,960
So it's quite a bit of wind but it's

182
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
It's beautiful it's

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,600
It's actually the sun really is warmed it up a lot it's not cold

184
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,480
It's just it's quite a bit of wind that's I estimate

185
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
20 20 knots

186
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,760
Yeah

187
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
It's probably what it is actually

188
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,520
Not bad for flying but it's gusty so I'm not quite sure

189
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Where it's coming from it's coming from the

190
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
Is that from the south

191
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
East I think is where the wind is coming from today

192
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,040
And you can hear uh

193
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,480
Aircraft overhead flying really high

194
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,920
Those are the jets

195
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,760
Going to Heathrow I can see one two

196
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Three of them stacked up on their way in

197
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay, let me just grab my notes a couple things I wanted to talk about with you

198
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,920
Okay, what do we have here number one oh

199
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Yeah, I talked the other day about the podcast specification working group

200
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,440
PSWG dot blog spot dot com so I emailed so of course after

201
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,880
My comments from yesterday I think it was

202
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I got an email and

203
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,760
So you know what I said was I don't like the fact that although I think it's a good idea that we're trying to improve

204
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
I should wrote my camera man. This is stupid

205
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,040
They're trying to improve the technology of of podcasting

206
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,320
Primarily on the on the iPodter side on the receiver side of the equation

207
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,800
And when I went to that site

208
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:38,800
I saw only three links to three iPodter clients and I say well, you know what's this either you

209
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,280
Link to everybody's iPod or link to no one

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,120
So that was apparently just you know they set up the blog spot and

211
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,800
Weblog and there was three links and they just filled in the links of the

212
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,240
The founding members of the group and so they invited me to come in and I said well, you know

213
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,520
So how's this gonna work is this going to be a

214
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,320
An open discussion or closed discussion and

215
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
The way they want to do it apparently

216
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Is they want to

217
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Discuss things behind closed doors

218
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
And then whatever they come up where they want to bring that out into the open

219
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Hello

220
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
He wasn't too friendly

221
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,440
I walked past a gate there's some gardens here

222
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,040
I guess garden you can rent a patch of land

223
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,240
here on the side of the downs and you can have your own little garden

224
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
And

225
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,120
Some guy going through the gate there a smile to Adam say hello, but

226
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,480
You thought the hell is wrong with you must be one of those damn podcasters

227
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,800
So the podcast the specification working group yeah

228
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,040
So I don't know I mean I don't have a lot of experience with

229
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Working on

230
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,760
Standards and protocols and stuff like that and the only the only time I really have had an experience with it was

231
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,200
When we started the iPodter developer mailing list

232
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,640
Which is where all the development was done initially on on the first iPodters

233
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
And that was all out in the open

234
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
I enjoyed that very much although

235
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,920
Well, we need to speak now

236
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,960
I don't know walk down a little bit and then I'll turn around on my back to the wind

237
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,320
After we've gone like up to the golf course here because of course as golf courses everywhere in the

238
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Um

239
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,680
So I don't know if that's a good idea to have that closed off you know their point was

240
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,080
That they

241
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,760
They don't want the quote groupies showing up and making a lot of noise. You know like groupies

242
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,440
Yeah, I think everyone has a say in this and everyone's interested and

243
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,440
I just don't have a good feeling about it and doesn't seem to me the way that to you know open source projects work

244
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:13,120
So I'm still I'm gonna wait a little bit and think about it. I just wanted to feel you know on that

245
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
I got a

246
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,720
Shoot man, let me

247
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,760
Went around now horrible. I got an email from Garth Kidd who is

248
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,240
One of the developers on the iPodter lemon and

249
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,760
If you upgraded your iTunes

250
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
This past week. I think it's version 4.8

251
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
Guess what your iPodter doesn't work anymore

252
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
This is totally fucking sucks

253
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,320
I'm not quite sure what Apple did or what they changed that I presume it's something in the in the way that you talk to it in the way that

254
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,600
You know you you update the playlist and and given update command

255
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,040
Which doesn't make a lot of sense to me because

256
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
There must be

257
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,840
Thousands

258
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
tens of thousands of programs

259
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,080
that use

260
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
either Apple script or

261
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,240
What is that is it it's a calm object I think in on the Windows platform

262
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
to update

263
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
and basically talk to iTunes

264
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,200
So it can do stuff both in iTunes and obviously to your iPod

265
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
And

266
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,520
Doesn't make sense that Apple would release a fix that would basically break that

267
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,560
But it happened oh man

268
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm sorry I'm just trying to find a

269
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,680
Direction to walk you know what he's events and you go over sit here for a second

270
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,440
So it doesn't make sense to me that

271
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,920
Apple would purposely break

272
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,920
All those scripts

273
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose, but

274
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,600
Man, they don't know their developer community

275
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Certainly not the iPod in community

276
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,680
So

277
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,360
There's a new a new version of iPod element available

278
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,720
at ipod.sourceforge.net download that and everything will be fixed

279
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
and I'm sure that

280
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,440
Information will be available very soon about what exactly was broken and what exactly happened

281
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
Now their interesting development this past week is the release of the

282
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,640
Yahoo music engine

283
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,400
Which is basically well it's two things in one

284
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,600
It's a music player which is free for download that Yahoo released

285
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:48,400
And at the same time they have their music service where you can subscribe for I think it's four dollars and 95 cents a month

286
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
And you can

287
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,920
Download anything you want from their music store

288
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,040
I don't even think they call it a store from their from their service

289
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,960
And it will play in the Yahoo music engine and if you have friends who also subscribe then you can you know basically make playlists and

290
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,560
And swap those out amongst each other and they don't have to pay anything additional they'll have to still have pay the 495 a month

291
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,280
This is the another way of looking at at legal music on the internet because this of course is completely

292
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:32,160
Managed by DRM digital rights management and what happens is you don't actually ever own those songs

293
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,480
You can use them on your computer. I presume that you can use them on multiple computers

294
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,360
if you if you if you use the same

295
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,560
User name or whatever your idea is and you keep paying your subscription

296
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,000
But once you stop paying your subscription then it all goes away

297
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
And I don't know that's a good thing or bad thing

298
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,760
495 certainly seems like a very good deal and they claim to have a million songs

299
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,160
So

300
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,520
You know that may be pretty good and of course you can also put them on to your on to your mobile device

301
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,960
But again, you're you're locked in right you have to pay the 495 for for as long as

302
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
You want to be using that music

303
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,440
So there's

304
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Pros and cons to that

305
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,520
What's interesting about the Yahoo music engine is they have a plug-in architecture and

306
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,120
I'll have to find the link and I'll put that in the show notes for today's source code

307
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,960
There's a podcast plug-in. I think it's called podcast plus

308
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,000
far cry from from an iPod or basically you fill in a

309
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,120
You could create a list of RSS links podcast feeds and then you hit download and it goes out

310
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,760
You know searches it's kind of you know a little aggregator

311
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Goes out searches the feeds looks of anything's new and if there's a new file available it downloads it and puts it right into

312
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,840
Your into your player. I don't think it even creates a playlist

313
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,040
Specifically based upon the feed title

314
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,800
It's certainly not that I could find it doesn't have any automatic checking features

315
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,640
And of course none of the management features that we work so hard on on the iPod or developers list

316
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,080
Which is stuff like you know download only the the latest podcast catch-up features clean-up features

317
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
There's a lot of stuff there, but it's a good start

318
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,080
Oh

319
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,160
This wind is crazy. It's a really good start. No start walking again. It's a really good start

320
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,640
But it it made me realize that we could be doing so much more

321
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
like this

322
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,920
Particularly in in Windows

323
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,680
Media player as well as an iTunes as far as I know both of those have some form of

324
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,760
A plug-in architecture and I think that would be really

325
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,760
Really quite nice if we could take some of these beautiful iPod or engines and just plug them into the player

326
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Of your choice and how about the the windamp guys? I know they have a plug-in architecture

327
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
I haven't seen an iPod or client for that

328
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,640
Seems like such a logical choice because instead of having a playlist in my

329
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,040
In my iPod or and in my player I'd much rather just you know use the player of my choice and have it be

330
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,080
iPod or enable hey we could even create a little logo iPod or inside

331
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
So that's the Yahoo music engine

332
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,880
I wrote down here cast blaster beta

333
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
I quite sure what I was gonna say about that

334
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,560
Other than that we're up to

335
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Beta 11 right now

336
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,120
And Microsoft has offered to help that's very nice

337
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
They've offered to help us out

338
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,400
With the sound issues. I don't know if they really can actually

339
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,520
But I think it's more a hardware problem than a software issue

340
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
And the problem is is that

341
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Unlike with the with a Mac

342
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,760
Where they have their core audio and it's a standardized

343
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,200
You know they know what the hardware is that their software's gonna be talking to

344
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
On windows

345
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
You know you're talking to

346
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,600
a third party

347
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,240
device that is your sound card and

348
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,480
Wow, I didn't know this but there's a shitloader different sound cards out there and every single one specifies

349
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,800
You know there are their capabilities a little bit differently

350
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
So for instance if you want to

351
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,680
Tell the sound card

352
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,880
Well actually if you ask the sound card through software you say okay, well, what is the

353
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
The master

354
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Volume control

355
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,680
The sound some sound cards will say okay, it's called master volume and

356
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Some will say it's the red one

357
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,000
So it's pretty funky, but that's really nice so we're gonna see if we can

358
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,520
If we can work with Microsoft and there's certainly willing to help us and I appreciate that

359
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,360
If you've been sending the email over this past week, you know with the start of the pod show on serious

360
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,320
Forget about it. I just went through 200 emails. I have 3600

361
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,280
Unread emails and you know, I rarely ever

362
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,520
Recheck something is unread to go back later. I try and deal with it immediately. That's the only way I know how to manage the email

363
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,120
So I apologize if I haven't gotten back to you

364
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,840
Oh, remember I think it was last week

365
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
Maybe the week before the rocket 15 pod casts

366
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,120
I played a promo. I think a rocket 15 man's getting one when we open my jacket

367
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,840
They were gonna be pod casting and I see my mic has slipped a little bit

368
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:47,760
There we go. They're gonna be pod casting from the infield of the Kentucky Derby and there was some comment there

369
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,600
Like we're all getting naked on the infield and I said, oh, yeah, right

370
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,960
You know, like people get naked if they can tucky Derby. Well, I got an email from the fine folks over at

371
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Rocket15.com. Oh, yeah

372
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,960
They do get naked very nice pictures

373
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,080
I don't know if any of that will be reflected in the pod cast, but it was really nice

374
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,600
Just I didn't know him when I think Kentucky Derby, you know for some reason I think

375
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,560
I know I just wasn't it looks like woodstock. Let's put it that way. You know

376
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Girls on guys shoulders

377
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Pulling up their shirts

378
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Very funny

379
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,040
So we're at the top of the hill now

380
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,520
Let me see

381
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,080
Everything yeah, I've talked about everything. I want to talk about so just finish this up and

382
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,200
Just listen to a bit of nature for a second how about that let me here the birds

383
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,880
See if I can find a spot where some birds are really talking to each other

384
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,400
I wish Patricia were along for this this walk

385
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,240
She has an uncanny knack of being able to talk to birds and they talk back or are talking is a big a big statement whistles

386
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,520
She can whistle and they'll whistle exactly the same tune and then she changes it and then they change it

387
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,760
And there's a variation and she totally gets into sync and harmony with them. It's very cool. Oh

388
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,520
That's a nice bit of nature that hell is that

389
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,320
Leathblower too early for leaf blower

390
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,000
I think someone's doing some construction on their house. Okay. We're gonna walk through

391
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
The very narrow path here

392
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Man haven't been up this

393
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
This high in a long time. It's really

394
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
The fields have grown

395
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
It's up to my waist

396
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Count okay

397
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:47,200
To reduce some of the swing boy. I'm glad I didn't bring the the stereo griff and lapel mic that would have been totally

398
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,680
Electrical this is beautiful. I'm standing up here

399
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,320
Dude, I really I'm stupid. I didn't bring my yeah bring my camera

400
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,560
Standing at the top of the downs

401
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,560
So it's probably about a mile from the house and I can see

402
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,040
Obviously I can't see all the way to London but I can see what would that be all the way in the distance

403
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
I'm wondering

404
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,360
That's not Heathrow is it now is too close. I can see the gulfard castle which is a

405
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,040
Another spot on the sound seeing tour radar

406
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,160
Talks about that yesterday about the millennium two thought or the millennium two thousand time capsule

407
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,240
Which is apparently stored at the

408
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Castle of Gulfard

409
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,240
Trying to hold my hand in front of the mic to reduce them with that noise out here's with it

410
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,760
Here's where the construction's going on there

411
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,960
Rebuilding a house here but on the edge of the downs. I must be beautiful to

412
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,440
To have it well. I don't know if you look out over the downs from your living room

413
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,440
That's kind of nice, but of course everybody can look back in and it's public so

414
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,200
Anybody can walk around here

415
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,640
I could easily land the sessina here too the wind is just perfect for it

416
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,560
Little downhill slope, but I could do it

417
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,480
And I know one thing for sure that would be completely illegal

418
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,920
I have a sneaky suspicion that my my buddies

419
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
The Dutch the pilots

420
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,080
We're over the other day who fly the shenooks and are training the bridge here how to fly

421
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,040
They'll probably do a low hover one of these days now that they've seen you know now

422
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,280
They know exactly what the coordinates are and where we are on the map and it would be perfect for them to

423
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,560
To come into a hover so I will definitely have the

424
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,640
The eye river and stuff standing by for when that happens one of these days

425
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Okay

426
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,640
So

427
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Looking forward to a great weekend

428
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,360
See how much what are going on the clock here? 29 minutes great. I'll take you all the way back in home

429
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,160
Back inside the home and then we'll go up to the studio and then we'll switch off so we'll have about

430
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
35 minutes exactly

431
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,000
Wow

432
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,760
I was supposed to go flying this weekend

433
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
I was supposed to pick Patricia up

434
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,400
In Rotterdam fly back and then do some major training but

435
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,000
If the wind keeps up like this I don't know about the training because it just doesn't make sense to

436
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,640
Do a lot of touching goes and

437
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,240
And another types of training with this much wind because you're not really learning anything

438
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,760
You're basically fighting the elements

439
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,360
And you can only do so many configurations and so I hope it dies down a bit

440
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,800
They're predicting more winds that doesn't look too good, but

441
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,160
Definitely gonna pick her up. That shouldn't be a problem. We can handle a lot more wind than this

442
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,040
Okay

443
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,920
Cutting through a little path to the right here

444
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Oh man, so beautiful

445
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,120
So nice to get out for a couple of minutes. I appreciate you coming along with me

446
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,720
And I hope that you're gonna have a good weekend

447
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,320
Monday

448
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
We have

449
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,680
The first official week of the pod show on serious

450
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,840
Thanks for all the comments on the on the test hour

451
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,520
As we've been formatting P.W. Phantom and I have been formatting the show and and looking at

452
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,840
You know different ways to put it together and you know automating a lot of the process because we have so much incoming

453
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Submit at podshow.com

454
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Podsafe at podshow.com and mashup at podshow.com

455
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,280
We're figuring out new and novel ways to basically store up the bins and have the computer do some of the work

456
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,200
We're not really selecting anything on you know what's good or not we haven't this nothing's ever been rejected

457
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,120
You know just put whatever comes in we put it in and I have the feeling that if this really takes off the way I'm planning it to work

458
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,920
We

459
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,000
We might have a whole channel before too too long and that could

460
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,240
Really translate well if you can keep you get the automation part working. I could translate pretty well into a

461
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,520
A full channel very much like open podcast.org

462
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,640
You know because like I'd love

463
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,800
To have many more full length podcast

464
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Being played right now. I can do about one an hour

465
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,160
And I you know that's anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes

466
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
And hi guys

467
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
I guess

468
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,240
Swabber are too doggy they're outside back doors open

469
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,600
Barbara who comes in the thing up to

470
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
If the house every Friday

471
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,680
Left the door open for me. Okay, so we're back in the kitchen

472
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,560
There's ginger what we missed you ginger you didn't come along for the ride

473
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Hmm, we missed you

474
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Hey

475
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,480
Right, uh, let's go upstairs

476
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,240
It's a much shorter walk and it used to be in the castle

477
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Much shorter

478
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,480
Okay, it's only three flights of stairs to get up to the top

479
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,040
And here we are

480
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,840
Close the door. I didn't tell Barbara what I was doing. She gave me a really strange look

481
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,880
What the hell is he doing? I knew he was crazy. I didn't know he was that crazy

482
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Okay, and we are

483
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,840
Back in the studio. Okay, so

484
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,320
Whatever you're gonna do this weekend have a good one take care of yourself stay subscribed please if you don't know how to subscribe if you're just listening to this

485
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,560
Straight from a download from the web

486
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
You know this is awesome little programs called iPodders

487
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,760
There's a whole bunch of them at ipodder.org you can go look for

488
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,360
Download software. It's a link on the right-hand side of the page

And you can choose for any type of operating system multiple flavors all kinds of

490
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,000
Great applications that have individual benefits

491
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,000
And

492
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,480

That's what they're all about

495
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,720
Okay, that's it for the daily source code have great weekend and I'll be back on Monday. Bye bye
