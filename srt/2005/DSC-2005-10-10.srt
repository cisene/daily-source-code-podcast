00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Delta Shira Charley 2, 5, 7.

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:20,800
Beloved brothers and sisters, dear Adam, Patricia, Christina, welcome, I'm Father Rodrick.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,600
We are gathered here for a last farewell to a trusty companion, a great and beloved partner

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,240
that helped and supported you in all your podcasting adventures and in many more things.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,880
And to recently, always there, always reliable, always ready to give you what you needed.

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,880
Adam, may I invite you to light a candle for your deceased power book.

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Thank you.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,960
The last couple of days have been difficult.

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,080
Your laptop, one's a real power book, started to show signs of diminishing power.

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:05,200
I walked in and I could hear my hard drive going, and that's usually a bad sign.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,280
The symptoms were small at first, little hiccups in the audio, sometimes a spinning

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,600
beach ball that didn't go away.

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,200
Oh, man, I now have the spinning beach ball of death.

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,080
After I asked it to advance to the next file.

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,880
And since your relationship until then, had always been perfect, you Adam didn't really

16
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,720
understand this behavior.

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,560
In your confusion, use sometimes, understandably, reacted with irritation, and sometimes even

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
anger.

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,520
I'm going to go throw this piece of shit out, but we know this map.

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
I'm so angry.

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,560
So bad, piece of shit.

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,320
But little did we know, these symptoms were the beginning of the end.

23
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,120
When you realize that your laptop was terminally ill, that no quick fixes or shaking the

24
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,960
box could help, you surrounded your ailing power book with all the love and carry you

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,600
had.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,000
You spent countless hours in front of the freezer where your suffering power book was cooling

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,320
down, and you used every tool that you're disposal to save as much data as possible.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,080
And then, much faster than we all expected, it was all over.

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,760
Please, it's crying.

30
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,120
It's hampering my work, man.

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,560
Sorry about that.

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,240
Try to take my composure there.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,560
Of course, we are sad.

34
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,560
And at them, you told us that you can't think of another power book anytime soon.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,040
It's too early, perhaps next year, who knows, take your time.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,000
And as we seem together, the imparadism know that you can always count on my support in

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,880
these difficult times.

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,480
You know where you can find me.

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,880
My podcast is just a click away, and www.gatholicinsider.com.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:23,000
And don't worry, my podcasts are a lot more cheerful than this sad goodbye.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
Just how cool is that, huh?

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,160
Rest in peace, dear power book.

43
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,600
It is October 10th, in year of our Lord, 2005, hell, everybody, welcome from Curry Cottage,

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,200
11.25 in the AM, start of a brand new week, we've got a lot of stuff to do today, playing

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,720
that pieces of interviews, got some awesome mashups, and of course, you're probably

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,600
a power, you know, it's actually thinking about putting together a little piece about

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
my power book.

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,160
That's what I was thinking yesterday, and I was kind of hunting around for a couple of

49
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,280
pieces of music, and then father wrote rejects it, and with that incredible requiem for

50
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,000
my father-in-law power book, it's kind of confusing at the same time, you know, father

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,280
wrote from the Catholic Insider, Catholic Insider.com is a real priest from the Netherlands.

52
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,280
And there he is, kind of making fun of making fun of the whole religion, I don't know,

53
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
I like that.

54
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,840
Well, definitely put yet another new, you know, it's shown and yet another new light

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,800
on father-roadery.

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,880
For me, at least this guy is a funny man, I love the stuff he's doing.

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
I think he came out, did he?

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,440
They've seen with like the seventh Harry Potter episode of the Catholic Insider by now, it's

59
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,880
really quite unbelievable to stuff he's doing.

60
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
The English story is called jam back, as I said today.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,920
It is a beautiful autumn day in the United Kingdom, the leaves are just starting to fall,

62
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,720
sunny, smells really nice outside.

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,680
Which means we can only add to the fragrances, right?

64
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,480
By adding some mashups to the mix, perhaps.

65
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,960
This is one that came from Pilchard, it was part of a full on mega mix that came in over

66
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,280
the weekend on the mashuptown.com RSS feed.

67
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,120
And actually it was like 25 minutes long and I said, dude, can you talk to Pilchard

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,120
see if I can get just this mashup, just this one piece I'd love to play it on the show

69
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
because it's one of, by one of my favorites.

70
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:39,320
I can't walk in these streets too long, singing in the same old song, I know if we

71
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:50,520
cracked in these 30 sidewalks of Broadway, but also the name of the game, and nice guys

72
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:59,440
get watched away like the snow and the rain, there's been a little cough from my

73
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:11,880
eyes, on the road to my eyes, but I'm gonna feel the tight, I'm shining on me, like a ranch

74
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:41,880
song cowboy, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a

75
00:06:41,880 --> 00:07:11,880
horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need e horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need an horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse, I need a horse

76
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
I'm so proud of you

77
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm a good man, I'm a strong people, I don't even know

78
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
And all those coming over the wall

79
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm a good kid

80
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
I'm a good kid

81
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm a good kid

82
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I'm a good kid

83
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Maybe it doesn't even qualify

84
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
As a master, maybe it's just a remix

85
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I'm telling you, re-release that thing

86
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
And this version, you've got a guaranteed kid on your hands

87
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,880
You just can't take away from the right stone cowboy

88
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,880
It's a Glen Campbell remix on your daily source code coming to you from Curry Cottage

89
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Only a few more days, end of the week, Sunday

90
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
I'll be back in California for a week

91
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Then I come back, Christina has her full-term

92
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Sorry, her half-term

93
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
She's pregnant, she's full-term

94
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,880
I think we're going to go to Portugal for a few days

95
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Then we come back and then I'll head on back to California

96
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
So, and in this week, on Wednesday and Thursday

97
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
I'm going to the Netherlands, I've got some business stuff

98
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
That I still have to finalize there

99
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Of course, I've coordinated that with some flying with the wing commander

100
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Haven't quite said all the times yet

101
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
But he promised me to be available, so

102
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Looking forward to that

103
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Over the weekend

104
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Well, as Father Roderick already kind of summed it up there

105
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
The power book died

106
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,880
May the power book, well actually the power book didn't die because the shell of the soul

107
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Of the power book is still alive

108
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
He those birds in the background

109
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
They hear, they hear fall coming too

110
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Here's what I did for those of you who have been tracking it and just want to know

111
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,880
I went out, bought a G5 iMac

112
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,880
And I installed a fresh copy of Tiger on that

113
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Then

114
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
This is kind of cool, I have the desktop Mac

115
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Which is on one of the cinema displays

116
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
It's actually my old-old power book

117
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
And the screen display, it's a type book

118
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Actually the screen display broke on that

119
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
And I never got around descending it off

120
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I just hooked it up to the external monitor

121
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,880
And that's kind of like the main desk machine that we have here

122
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,880
So I used Apple's migration tool

123
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,880
So essentially what I did was I got a fire wire drive

124
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Had a 30 gig fire wire drive laying around that doesn't need an external power source

125
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
I cleaned it all up

126
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
And you know reformatted the whole thing

127
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Named it Macintosh HD

128
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Plugged it into the power book

129
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Because of course, it's the drive that is completely hose

130
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
And I had done a lot of work over the weekend

131
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Getting as much data off of this possible

132
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Almost everything

133
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
I probably missed about 20 pictures that I hadn't uploaded yet to flicker

134
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Of course everything else is uploaded to flicker

135
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,880
And my root 66 install and of course that's a great mapping program

136
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Which I use a lot for aviation in Europe

137
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
And I can't find the install CD

138
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
So I'll have to figure that one out

139
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
And otherwise

140
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
You know it's kind of reboot a refresh of my life

141
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Oh my MP3s that was a big concern

142
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Because I built up quite a nice library

143
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
And of course you're always archiving stuff here

144
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,880
And then you hear now and putting some stuff to the side

145
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
But it really was like my complete MP3 collection

146
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
I was a little bit bummed out about that

147
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I could not get that off and then

148
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Yeah, I'm saying like wow man this is really sucks

149
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
How am I going to get off? I'm looking at my iPod

150
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
I'm going dude

151
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
I have my MP3 collection

152
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
It's on my iPod

153
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Then of course I had to go through the whole rigmarole of

154
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Figuring out how to you know how to sync that back into

155
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
A new iTunes which is Apple doesn't make very easy for you

156
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
But this plenty of programs out there that let you do it

157
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,880
It's reasonably easy to do kind of like a blowback

158
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
From your iPod back to a new install of iTunes

159
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
And then I did something interesting

160
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
After I had that 30 gig drive

161
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Already to go

162
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
I used the migration tool from the desktop

163
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
So it pulled in an already familiar environment for me

164
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
It already had a lot of the applications installed

165
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
And it's running fine

166
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
It doesn't boot us now obviously

167
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Because instead of sitting right there on the mother board

168
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
With some connection

169
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
It's connected through fire wire

170
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
So at least I have a portable machine

171
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
With all the data that I need

172
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
With me to take with me

173
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Until the new power books come out

174
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Which I'm still thinking is going to be this Wednesday

175
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
I think that that's the one more thing announcement

176
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Everyone's talking about the video iPod

177
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
And I was just thinking again man

178
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
It's like

179
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
I'd basically

180
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Prefer to listen to the audio

181
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Of

182
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Well, that's not entirely true

183
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
I mean actually I have a piece of

184
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Video that managed sent me maybe I should play that later for you

185
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
See if the audio does it although

186
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Looking at mad showing me

187
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Fred and Ethel

188
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
I

189
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Yeah, there's something to be said for that

190
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
That words and audio just can't

191
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Describe if you've ever listened to yeast radio

192
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Then you know what I'm talking about

193
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
And then I finally

194
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Completed my

195
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
My the integration of the blackberry into my life

196
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Of course all of my

197
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Contacts and address books had been

198
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Saved and synced in a million places including

199
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Dot Mac and Apple does that so well

200
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
You know you just connect up your iCal

201
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
And your address book and it sucks in everything

202
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
It had reconciles all the double entries

203
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,880
And then you I bought the was it the the blackberry pocket Mac

204
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Software

205
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,880
And installed it and it basically synchronized everything

206
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Had to had to fix one or two

207
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Phone numbers that didn't carry over the

208
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,880
We're already in the device that just didn't get merged and it's perfect

209
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,880
So yeah, you hear it the birds are singing it's beautiful weather

210
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
And we've got some promos

211
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Why listen to the NRKX podcast?

212
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Well, it's funny without being comical

213
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
If you're looking to classify this podcast

214
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
I wouldn't put in the comedy

215
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Don't don't know how it's comedy man

216
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Oh, why?

217
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
What do you mean I put it under?

218
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Tragedy

219
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
To have a category for graduate

220
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
We can create one just for us

221
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
It's sexual without being sexy

222
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
You know one hand on her pants

223
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
You know the glasses are off so no shit now

224
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
I look fantastic. I look like Robert Rudd for now

225
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
You know and she's a fucking goddess without the glasses on

226
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Stop looking my balls

227
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
She's back at it

228
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
It's sad without being pathetic by the way. I live in a tool shed

229
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Did I tell you that?

230
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
It does

231
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Absolutely true. It's not a lie

232
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Matt House. I tell people I live in the guest house

233
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
But that's bullshit

234
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
If you're shed friendly

235
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Yeah, I tell you what

236
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
I've gotten no complaints from the chicks that I've banged in the shed

237
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
That's the shit

238
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
They kick him over more

239
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
It's political

240
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Without being politically correct

241
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
What gets me is that?

242
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
The other day on the news

243
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
I saw that this fucking shit eating grin on his face

244
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
What that what that grin is saying is

245
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
You know what?

246
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Don't fuck around

247
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
We're fucking you over that

248
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
I'm gonna get away as the truth

249
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Some of these people are cockroaches

250
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
And they operate in the shadows

251
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
And it's stupid without being idiotic

252
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
I'm a little lishy with a little more

253
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
I'm irrect

254
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Oh my god

255
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
That's a man's man

256
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
There was one

257
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
That furry fucker

258
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Yep

259
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880

Yeah, I'll tell you how you misinterpret it

274
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
You want it to mean something else

275
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
So you decide it means something else

276
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880

Awesome dude

Very, very cool

320
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Today

321
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
I guess

322
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
It wasn't that much of a secret

323
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Because

324
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Yahoo would send out emails to a number of podcasters

325
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
This podcasters are not included by the way

326
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
That they were going to start pointing to podcasters

327
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,880
From different Yahoo media properties

328
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
And today it's official or I guess it went official

329
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Yes, they podcast.yahoo.com

330
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Yahoo has built a directory of podcasters

331
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Which is

332
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Fuh

333
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Fuh

334
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Phenomenal

335
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Once again

336
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Another boost in distribution

337
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
I love this

338
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
I love it so much

339
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
So you know that today I'll be

340
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,880
I'll be checking out the server logs to see what the increase is

341
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
This is great

342
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,880
You know, the more companies that come online and offer access to podcasters

343
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
The better

344
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,880
I really, really, and dig in this

345
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,880
They've done something so to actually pretty smart

346
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
I like the way

347
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
I like their way

348
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,880
They're trying to stay away from a lot of the technology

349
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
And just driving people into listening to podcasters

350
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Because I think that that's really

351
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,880
It's almost like, you know, how Tevo started

352
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,880
And Tevo had this huge budget

353
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Marketing budget

354
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
They're like $300 million

355
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,880
And I think they spent most of the $300 million

356
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Trying to explain to people what Tevo was

357
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
And you know, so they wound up

358
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
I don't know if that's the beginning of the end

359
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,880
But they took investments basically from all the major mainstream media

360
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Companies, from the television companies

361
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,880
In all the fact kind of control what Tevo does

362
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,880
I think this is just the perception I have from

363
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
From now it'siders view

364
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Where really, if you just given away

365
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Thousands of Tevo's

366
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,880
People would have understood it once they, you know, because you know how Tevo works

367
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,880
You know, you install it and install it kind of like a BCR

368
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,880
And everyone can, I guess, kind of understand what the wiring is

369
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,880
And then you use it and then you just go, oh my god

370
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,880
You know, and oh, please, it's the trial period over

371
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
No, you can't take this away

372
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
I can't live without it

373
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,880
You know, once you've done live pause and you've figured out how to record stuff

374
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
And the interface is, I think, pretty damn easy

375
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,880
It's not advanced, but it's very easy and it works well with a remote control

376
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,880
So I think that's the way we should continue to consider promoting podcasting

377
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
It's just listen, go ahead, just listen to one

378
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Forget about all the, you know, the synchronization part and RSS

379
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
And just listen to it first

380
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
And tell me if you're not completely blown away

381
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,880
By the freshness of these, these programs that you hear that you don't want more

382
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
And you don't want to, you know, eventually, of course

383
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Figure out how to get it onto your MP3 player on onto your iPod

384
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
And you'll want to manage your subscriptions

385
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Because you love this stuff

386
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
That's the way we should be approaching it

387
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,880
So tip of the hat to Yahoo for, for jumping in

388
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,880
And it looks like, yeah, it looks like they've really done a very good job

389
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,880
I haven't quite seen how they output their directory yet

390
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,880
And I presume they populated that from, from different sources

391
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Including indiepotter.org

392
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,880
So I'm wondering if they have an OPML version of their directory on the back end

393
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Which would make it even cooler that we could start integrating that into applications

394
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,880
And I'd love to have a feedback because, you know, we basically may not have everything we want in indiepotter

395
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
That's a possibility

396
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,880
That's something that Apple, Apple didn't do

397
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Or has not yet done provide the directory structure on the back end

398
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,880
So I'm maybe just haven't seen it yet

399
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,880
And over the weekend, I actually was funny because I was thinking about calling Ron and saying, you know, dude

400
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
It's about time for another strategy cast

401
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Now that we kind of have some of our strategy together

402
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
And we're actually building some pieces of our network

403
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Well, we've been building for a half a year or more

404
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Yeah, we've really got people in building some technological pieces of our network

405
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
And then I came across a podcast called On the Record

406
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
I think Eric Schwartzman is the host

407
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,880
And he was interviewing Ron and I was listening to it and like, you know what?

408
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm just going to use some of the strategy cast space to let you listen to

409
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,880
A piece of this interview because it's, it's viewed as well it's right on

410
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,880
And also Ron sounds, you know, little feisty in angry

411
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
And I kind of like it when he's like that, check this out

412
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,880
As alienating as it may be to viewers

413
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,880
The mergers and consolidations that we've seen in the media world

414
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Do play a role in what gets covered and what doesn't

415
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
I mean, I was recently watching

416
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,880
I think it was the early show with Harry Smith, which is CBS Network Morning Show

417
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,880
And they had a technology reporter on

418
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,880
He was demonstrating where's, you know, new technology things that you can buy

419
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,880
One was a portable DVD viewer

420
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,880
And you could load DVDs into it and take it with you on an airplane

421
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,880
That type of thing and he sort of said he sort of sluffed it off

422
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,880
But he said, oh, you mean you could put an entire season of Spongebob on this

423
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,880
That was Harry Smith's question to the tech reporter

424
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
And the tech reporter said sure and they moved on

425
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Now you and I both know that CBS is owned by Viacom, Viacomones Nickelodeon

426
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,880
So that was very calculated that comment by Harry Smith

427
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
And as we've seen in the world of syndicated television

428
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,880
If you're an independent producer in our days

429
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
If you can't get distribution

430
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Because the studios would rather

431
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Make their station groups take a program that they're bringing out of the hopper

432
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Rather than a program from someone else that could be less profitable for them

433
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,880
If it goes than something from their own studio if it goes

434
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,880
And in your strategy cast you guys when you guys were talking

435
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,880
I think it was Adam who said one of the ways that we build audiences for our podcast

436
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Is by getting covered in magazines

437
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,880
So I guess my question is there a risk

438
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,880
And that you guys are sort of building this new media can glamour

439
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,880
But you don't have a sort of a traditional media partner

440
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Well the chokehold look look look at what you're saying

441
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
You're saying that

442
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,880
That media which is about

443
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
They should even call it the media business

444
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
They should call it the frequency and infrastructure business

445
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,880
You know we've got a channel we own it

446
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
We have a chokehold on the content that goes through that channel

447
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Our barrier to entry

448
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Okay, our barrier to entry

449
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
Is that no one else has this frequency

450
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
That's that's the logic of radio

451
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Television had that logic until cable

452
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,880
As soon as cable opened up the so-called unlimited channel universe

453
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,880
A few bright companies said wait a minute

454
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,880
Here's a here's a channel that came out of nowhere turner communications

455
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Now it's said wait a minute

456
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
And 11 o'clock at night

457
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
There's three stations

458
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
And they all do the same thing at talk show

459
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I'm going to offer an alternative

460
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
I'm going to buy a bunch of old movie

461
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
Don't care what they are as long as they're not talk

462
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
And I'm going to stick it up there

463
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
That's the birth of turner communications

464
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Can you believe it? One little idea

465
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
How viewers might want something else

466
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
And it was very easy for them because the viewers were having

467
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Only one thing jammed at their eyes

468
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,880
An audio is playlist and formats right in Jack

469
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
You know or or soft listening or whatever it is

470
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Viewers are hit listeners are hit to that already

471
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
So so the idea of protecting

472
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Your turf up till podcasting

473
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Was on the on the frequency only infrastructure

474
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
You know on that and you and you

475
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,880
No matter what you find a lowest common denominator

476
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
And you strike costs down

477
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
And you put crap out there but people have no alternative

478
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
The delivery of crap against no alternative

479
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Is what's driven the media industry for the last 20 years

480
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Now

481
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
The argument of podcasting is

482
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Can we have a source of independently created art or content that is competitive

483
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Competitive with anything else that's out there

484
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,880
And the answer to that is a resounding yes, that's step one

485
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,880
That's before time shifting or RSS or any of that other crap

486
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Can we make content this is good is what's out there in audio the answer is yes

487
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Can we make music as good is what's licensed and limited the answer to that is yes

488
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
We got those two things going for us now

489
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Our listeners in

490
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Saciated with great listening alternatives the answer to that is no

491
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:48,880
What technology is out there that can able us to take this great shit that we can create and get it to those listeners who are interested in it

492
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,880
That's that's what happened

493
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
We did not invent a demand

494
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,880
We just enabled great content to be created and be delivered

495
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,880
It's much much simpler than trying to explain kind of what happened with the internet and social cocooning

496
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
2.0 and 1.0

497
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,880
It's without trying an entire media industry

498
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Conspired against itself to create willing listeners wanting to do something else

499
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
It's a beautiful thing

500
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Hot show content that will make you squeeze the dog and burp your mother

501
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,880
When you walk in the door and you change your shoes

502
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Switch to a sweater and said how do you do neighbor

503
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,880
How do you do

504
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,880
I remember the look in your sparkling eyes that's clearly

505
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,880
I love you don't you love nice neighbor

506
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,880
You saw me looking at you

507
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Open to picture

508
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Up on the wall the ice tree

509
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Standing on the merry-go-round

510
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
Spinning away, darling

511
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,880
Ooh, darling

512
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Where do you go today?

513
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Well, we've made the sand

514
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
And when we were walks in the park

515
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
You were a gentleman

516
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,880
We were home before the dark neighbor

517
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Speed delivery

518
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,880
Let's feel it

519
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Share a rocket show

520
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
It's out of backup

521
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,880
While lady and lady give him the eva

522
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Our neighbor

523
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,880
You never had to that way

524
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,880
In the whole world

525
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,880
This and this only one me and in your world

526
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,880
I was happy to be your neighbor

527
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Home in the world with lady I Berlin

528
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Lady I Berlin

529
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,880
She was so pretty

530
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I came home today

531
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,880
With a wave on my mind

532
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Life isn't simple anymore

533
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,880
But I know where I can find you

534
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,880
He said there's only one me and in your world

535
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,880
I was happy to be your neighbor

536
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Home in the world with lady I Berlin

537
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,880
In the whole world

538
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,880
This and this only one me and in your world

539
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,880
I was happy to be your neighbor

540
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Home in the world with lady I Berlin

541
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,880
In the whole world

542
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,880
I was happy to be your neighbor

543
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,880
Home in the world

544
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,880
With lady I Berlin

545
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,880
She was so pretty

546
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Thank you for

547
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,880
She was so pretty

548
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
From the pod safe music network

549
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
LeCivius Bitties

550
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
And neighbor

551
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Which is a song about the passing of Mr. Rogers

552
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
If you listen to the most recent Bittie cast

553
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
You get the whole explanation up front

554
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
That was live by the way

555
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Cut those girls are good

556
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
I love them

557
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
I love those girls

558
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
They're music also available

559
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,880
On the iTunes music store

560
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
So check them out

561
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
Podsame Music Network

562
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Music.podshow.com

563
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Still a lot of cool stuff going on with the Podsame Music Network

564
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Just what we saw we had over

565
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,880
One was over 1000 artists

566
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Not registered

567
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
We were like 8,000 tracks

568
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,880
And I wish I had CC's mail here

569
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
I think it was

570
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Over 3000 unique spins or something like that

571
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
It's unbelievable

572
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Unbelievable what's going on

573
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,880
I think 3000 podcasters

574
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Now registered

575
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
It's really really cool

576
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,880
And I also see I'll do that tomorrow

577
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Reminder

578
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
That piece where the BBC used cruise box

579
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
To talk about podcasting

580
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
Actually I got the whole piece

581
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,880
It's from BBC 6 which is a digital channel

582
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,880
So I'm not quite sure if that probably is a DAB I guess

583
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
So they probably have pretty good audience

584
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
I'll play that tomorrow

585
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
They played a couple of pod safe songs

586
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
And you have to listen to it because

587
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
They're dorks

588
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,880
And really are mega dorks

589
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,880
And there's a guy here in the UK

590
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
Who have kind of avoided

591
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
For the ever since he appeared on the scene

592
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
His name is Roger Smalls

593
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
And he may be a little uncomfortable

594
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Because he seems to be a bit of a stalker

595
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Although he does have a lot of

596
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,880
I think actually inside knowledge of

597
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
A lot of companies are doing what people

598
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Or what deals are being made in podcasting

599
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,880
But from time to time he'll send in

600
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Either a voice message or he'll send me

601
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Audio feedback

602
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
And it's just kind of creepy

603
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
But I want to introduce you guys to him

604
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Because if you don't know him already, Roger Smalls

605
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,880
And in the show notes for today

606
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
DailySourceCode.com

607
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
You'll find a link there to the show notes

608
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
The wiki notes of course he'll be a link to his website

609
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,880
And he has like a photo fan side of me

610
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
It's kind of scary

611
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
But I want to introduce you to him

612
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Because he's although frightening

613
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Without a doubt he's interested

614
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
They're right here

615
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
So I haven't been recording this lately

616
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
They've been very busy working

617
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
But they're in chips this week

618
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
And they've been going to the gym

619
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
They've been quite a lot

620
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
It's been pretty good though

621
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
They're the gym

622
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Because I started working together a little more

623
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
And getting at my confidence

624
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm also losing a little bit of weight which is good

625
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,880
As I was seriously considering light perception

626
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,880
But well until I saw the price anyway

627
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
And now I've got a little tips for you all

628
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
It goes to gym

629
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Just to meet girls

630
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Now when you start up any exercise machine

631
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
There's actually typing in age

632
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
You wait and you're stamina

633
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Which is kind of like what they do

634
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
And all those internet teaching websites

635
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
I'm always using

636
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,880
So trick is to get on the treadmill

637
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
Test an anti machine

638
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Where there's lots of pretty girls sitting around

639
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,880
And then it's just a case of waiting for one of them to have fun

640
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
But typing all that particular

641
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Listen to the machine

642
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Friend wants to see

643
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Now unless you really suspect

644
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
You don't want to think anyone about that

645
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Just leave me all of you like

646
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
And a good one of the priorities

647
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Like an old woman's equivalent of a date rate drug

648
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,880
And I use it to entice your men back to their chances of accommodation

649
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Not that I'm first in 90

650
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,880
It just been nice to get something a bit younger and firmer

651
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Now what's when the type in how much they weigh

652
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Because you'll find there's a lot more accurate

653
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Than trying to gauge how fat they are

654
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
And then big cognitive yet

655
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Now the trick is to use information

656
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
To start the conversation with them

657
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Because then you know how old they are

658
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
How fat they are

659
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
And how much they are

660
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
And how long they are left in the sack

661
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
For example

662
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
If a type in that they're quite heavy

663
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,880
Then you can start the conversation

664
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
By mentioning how soon they are

665
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
That way don't take it as a compliment

666
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,880
And you can use their age as a good conversation

667
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
Start too

668
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
I said to this woman last week

669
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
Hello name Roger

670
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Let's just say you were born in the late 1960

671
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
What she played with decades before

672
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Then

673
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
I don't think she knows talking about that when the mention

674
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
The Beatles and give me Hendrik

675
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
So she walks away

676
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
But never could take the start

677
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
At the gym to talk to girls

678
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Is the steam room and the sauna

679
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Now the ones that we're the keenest

680
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Are usually very up to themselves

681
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
And aren't talked here

682
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
You know the dinbos

683
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
They're so often you find a nice thin one

684
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Where in the swimming costume the friendliness

685
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
And this one girl at the way he came cold

686
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
Leaves that

687
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,880
And we got chatting about music and poetry

688
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
And murders mystery

689
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
I don't think so

690
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
But the only trouble

691
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Is that you can't let you sit in the sauna

692
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Two long talking to girls

693
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
To get really hot and you end up looking like

694
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
Dr. Zoe's bag

695
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
And it makes you skin

696
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Or she'll fall down like a raisin

697
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Now I'm going to keep going to the gym

698
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Hopefully you soon

699
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
One of them will ask me out on the date

700
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
But well I'm now

701
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
I can't record any podcasts

702
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
So I'm trying to do some more

703
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
When everyone's back up all the day

704
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
And I don't keep having to do the shift work

705
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
All the time

706
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
But for now I'm just back to work

707
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
And so goodbye

708
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
Adam Curry

709
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Should've said

710
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Hey Adam this is Mary

711
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
And this is Carla

712
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
And we're the stars up

713
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
But Mary and Carla show

714
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
We are at Mary and Carla.com

715
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
And what's the show about

716
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
It's two twenty-something sexy girls

717
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Who talk about whatever's on their mind

718
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
And that often includes

719
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Boys, sex, rap music

720
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
And movies and TV

721
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
And whatever we did on any current day

722
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
We love your show

723
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
And we want you to know

724
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
We're not nerds

725
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
As a matter of fact Adam

726
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
We don't know it

727
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
RSS feed from our tight little asses

728
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,880
But damn we are inspired by the whole podcasting world

729
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
And it really gets us hot and bothered

730
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
To purr into the microphone

731
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Adam

732
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,880

00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
I don't want to do

747
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,880

749
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880

766
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Check us out, baby!

767
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:24,460
Hey, it's Jo Dion, I'm watching the movie Flight Plan, I'm seeing it because I heard that the

768
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:37,060
flight attendant unions were upset about how the flight attendants were portrayed in it.

769
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,540
And they're calling for a boycott, I know it's ironic, seems to be if you don't want

770
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,660
someone to see anything you should just not talk about it, or maybe go on TV and

771
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,660
tell everyone how it ends.

772
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:57,540
Anyway, I'm conducting a poll, if you saw the movie called 3-2-3-2-8-4-5-1-0-4, and leave a message

773
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
with your opinion.

774
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,580
Do you think flight attendants are portrayed badly in this movie?

775
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,500
Was this boycott warranted, or officially?

776
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:10,180
Did you see it despite the boycott, or are you not going to see it because of the boycott?

777
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,580
Do you think flight plans should be two words or one?

778
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:28,980
It's in German, I think up at the wrong movie, I think I want to see flip-flon.

779
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,660
Skype me at Joe Podcastor or call 3-2-3-2-8-4-5-1-0-4, I have to go now, they're throwing

780
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:41,340
a popcorn at me, wait, that's an M&M, I like M&M, right back.

781

820
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,020
Hey, it's backwards and forwards.

821
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,520
No, I do.

822
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,860
Yeah, right.

823

I think.

842
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,340
Wrangles.

Time's up.

00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Number three.

845
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,340
Is that Sheila E?

846
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,340
Oh, she...

847
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,340
No, that's ready for the word.

848
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,340
Shh.

849
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340

I nailed this one.

854
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340

Number three.

862
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,340
The glamorous life.

863
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
That's what I did.

864
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,340
She like it.

865
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,340
Yeah.

866
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,340
It's a glamorous life.

867
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,340
So how did you do Adam?

868
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Three, man.

869
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,340
I got three out of three.

870
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
Okay, Adam.

871
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,340
Here's a bonus challenge.

872
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,340
Oh.

873
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
What do all of these songs have in common?

874
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,340
Uh, all female lead singers.

875
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Of course.

876
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,340
Time's up.

877
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,340
They were all written by friends.

00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:58,340
I've been watching like a hole in the sun

1053
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,340
In the sun, from my brain

1054
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,340
When I found a ship with me to open it

1055
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,340
And no, please, please

1056
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,340
We don't look here, but we don't understand

1057
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,340
When she found a ship with us, go

1058
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,340
I've been holding back with a ship

1059
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,340
I've found a ship to open it

1060
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,340
And no, I've found a ship with us, go

1061
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,340
They've found a ship with me to open it

1062
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,340
And no, please, we don't know

1063
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,340
When she found a ship with us, go

1064
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,340
I've found a ship with us, go

1065
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,340
I've found a ship with us, go

1066
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,600
bing her Gottmark, right in

1067
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,500
Snow Bund, ciggy Neredened

1068
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,380
Surprised so tight, tell me where that's all I'd crash

1069
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:22,380
It's a beautiful, with some of these mashups, are really a whole new piece of art.

1070
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,380
Whenever I hear that sacks from George Michael's family's whisper, I always think of

1071
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,380
a particular girlfriend.

1072
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:33,380
It's just at the end of the pirate radio days.

1073
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,380
Ben Lebronth did that.

1074
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,380
He mashed it up in 2004.

1075
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:43,380
It's a Liya, somebody's whisper, of course a Liya mixed up with George Michael.

1076
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,380
And his careless whisper.

1077
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:52,380
It's funny because I hadn't spoken to Ben in quite a while, and I mentioned him on the podcast.

1078
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,380
I played someone sent me a mix that he had done, and then he just sent me a quick email.

1079
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:03,380
He said, with a link to this song on his on his site, which he'd put up and he, you know,

1080
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,380
Ben, so he's so precise and so secure.

1081
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,380
He said, let me know when you have it, and then I'll take it off.

1082
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,380
But he said, I could play this one in the show, and I really appreciate it.

1083
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,380
Ben, you are the OG, man.

1084
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,380
Really, really are.

1085
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,380
When it comes to mashups and mixes, kind of just doing it since, you know, 1980, probably.

1086
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:29,380
I think we started on the radio show in 1982, and he was doing grand mixes and remixes

1087
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,380
and mashing stuff together.

1088
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,380
Awesome.

1089
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,380
Okay, Doki.

1090
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,380
So the start of a brand new week, as I said, have yourselves a really good one.

1091
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,380
Why do you know what's going to happen Wednesday and Thursday?

1092
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,380
My sister's coming.

1093
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,380
She's coming Thursday.

1094
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,380
So I'll get her on the show.

1095
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,380
That'll be fun.

1096
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,380
Tiffany, she's a hoot.

1097
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,380
You'll like that.

1098
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,380
And I'll be back tomorrow, right here.

1099
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,380
Stay subscribed to everybody.

1100
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,380
Thanks for listening.

1101
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,380
Bye-bye.
