1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Daily source code, 126-2005.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,040
Like, you know, does Adam Curry

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,320
cup his hand to his ass fart and then smell it?

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,520
Adam, the listeners of the Daily Download want to know.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,320
Autistic, it's Adam Curry.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,400
It is Thursday, January 27th.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,160
The power of the door, the door, the door.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,720
Everybody, how you doing?

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,120
Is Adam Curry coming to you from Curry Cottage

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,240
in the affluent Surrey Subber?

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,440
Sorry, Surrey Subber called Gilford.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,600
It's almost 10am.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,080
It is Thursday, January 27th.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,880
It's 2005.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,520
I was just a little snippet from the Daily Download.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,320
The answer, of course, is yes.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Of course, I'd love to be on your show.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I cannot imagine anything higher in life for me than you.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,040
Sitting in my bathroom studio,

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,680
Skyping to your bathroom studio.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,960
I mean, that would be fantastic.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,880
All right, today's source code, as promised,

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,400
a little bit different today.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,040
We're not going to do a sound scene tour.

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,440
You know, we try to vary the format from time to time.

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,480
Today is just going to be a conversation with Ken Clark.

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,280
I told you about him.

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,160
He worked at MTV for 20 years.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,720
Now, I've worked with Ken for at least 15 of those 20 years.

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,240
Maybe even a little bit more.

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,880
He's, we have a state mogul right now

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,880
of in Portland, Oregon.

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,840
And we decided that we would just shoot the shit a little bit

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
about the old MTV days.

35
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,400
Actually, it started with the Carson Daily song

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,480
that I played the other day, where we wanted to figure out

37
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,520
where all the MTV VJs have gone.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,040
It turns out there are actually 37 different VJs

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,240
that can us work within the past 20 years.

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,920
A lot of this conversation, I got actually

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
let Patricia listen to it yesterday.

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,320
Some of it's a bit inside.

43
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,600
But let me know what you think about it.

44
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,880
We should continue because, of course,

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,800
we only got like eight of the 37 people.

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,560
So if you think it's worth continuing,

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,880
let me know at curie.com.

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
Enjoy this.

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:22,360
On the Skype call now is someone who literally lived in my house

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,160
more than I did for a number of years.

51
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Who, who nannied me when necessary.

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,880
And is one of the unsung heroes of the breakthrough of MTV.

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,800
My friend and colleague, and this thing was gentleman

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,960
from somewhere with the West Coast, where the fuck is it?

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,520
Portland.

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,480
That's Portland.

57
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,760
Portland, Oregon.

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,920
Canster J, Ken Clark.

59
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,280
Welcome everybody.

60
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
Yeah, I'm here everybody.

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,680
So I actually have Skype recording for the first time.

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,560
Maybe it's the good karma you're bringing me.

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,240
Well, we'll see how it goes.

64
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,720
Immediately it started skipping.

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,240
Of course, of course.

66
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay, Ken.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,120
Let me set this up.

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,240
Let me set this up.

69
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,360
In our bad weeks with Skype.

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,760
Yeah, this is going pretty good so far.

71
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,600
Let me set this up.

72
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,360
I met you in 1987, Halloween around Halloween of 1987.

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,680
When I arrived on Ellis Island from from the Nether regions,

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,360
the lowlands and with my girlfriend, with my girlfriend,

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,000
she wasn't even my fiance then.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,440
She's my girlfriend Patricia.

77
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,480
And that's when I started at MTV.

78
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,240
And what was your title at the time, Ken?

79
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,400
Was it, what was the official title?

80
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,880
It started.

81
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,000
I was probably VJ coordinator.

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,760
I'm going to crank your level up a little bit here.

83
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,360
VJ coordinator.

84
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,520
That's a sucky title.

85
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,600
Well, later I, it was, uh, I got promoted to manager of on air talent.

86
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,720
Did you get a, did you get a pay raise with that?

87
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,520
A little bit.

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,240
MTV was never famous for paying well though.

89
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,760
I actually told everyone the other day.

90
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,560
Yeah.

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,160
Yeah, I heard you talking about it.

92
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,120
You did okay.

93
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard you talking about it.

94
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
You did better than me, too.

95
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,960
The very first VJ started for like 4550,000 bucks back in 1981.

96
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,760
1981.

97
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,120
August 1st, 1981.

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Yeah, and by the time you guys came around, everybody, you know,

99
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,960
was pretty staggered that it had gone way over $100,000.

100
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
Yeah.

101
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,400
But I think I made the most of all the, uh,

102
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,520
I made more than Julie Brown.

103
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,360
Tell me I did.

104
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,960
I think you probably did in the end.

105
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,360
Yeah.

106
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,720
You guys both ended up with kind of weird deals.

107
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
You were only doing certain shows, certain things.

108
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,760
I mean, I had no show.

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,960
I got fucking fired.

110
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,720
We, I got fired 25 times.

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Well, yeah, but I mean,

112
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
we did go back after a while and

113
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I feel like a week.

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I didn't do them like the top 20 countdown once a week.

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Because they couldn't find anyone to do it.

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Well, yeah.

117
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
They still haven't apparently.

118
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
But you already work out for one then, right?

119
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
You already working for me.

120
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
So what happened is Ken?

121
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Yeah, that point.

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Yes.

123
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
When did you start?

124
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
This is, we're never going to be able to fit this in 45 minutes.

125
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
When did you start at MTV?

126
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Because it must have been a couple years before I got there.

127
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,720
I started at MTV on New Year's Eve, 1984, 85.

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I flew into New York like the day after Christmas.

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
I was supposed to start in January.

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
They called me up on New Year's Eve day and said,

131
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
We're short staff.

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Come down here.

133
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
We're doing our live New Year's Eve ball.

134
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,720
That was 1984 and 1985 New Year's Eve.

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Goddamn.

136
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Wow.

137
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
And so that was with the original guys.

138
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Oh, yeah.

139
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Everyone thinks I'm one of the original VJs.

140
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
And I keep telling him, well, you were around two.

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Yeah.

142
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,720
But that was when MTV really exploded into 40 million households.

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Yeah.

144
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Yeah.

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Definitely.

146
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
You guys were there for that.

147
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
The first group.

148
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
But you know, Martha stayed on.

149
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
I think longer than anybody else.

150
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,720
But the majority of everybody else were gone within the first five years.

151
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
And it was.

152
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Off to a lustreous careers elsewhere between Channel 66 and 68 UHF.

153
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Well, it's interesting.

154
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
I made a couple of years ago, MTV few years ago.

155
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Actually, MTV brought me back a couple of times to do those.

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I was an MTV VJ specialist.

157
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
I know you came back to.

158
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
It was one of them.

159
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Yeah, one.

160
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Yeah.

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
What was that?

162
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
It was was it some anniversary.

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
It was an MTV VJ two.

164
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
And you were at on ramp at the time.

165
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
And I was already here in Oregon.

166
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
I flew back to do it.

167
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,720
But for that show, I had prepared a list of everybody that I could think of.

168
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,720
That I had worked with as a VJ over the.

169
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
I was 10 years that I was there.

170
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
So I come prepared at least with a list of people.

171
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Because there's names on this list.

172
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
I don't even remember.

173
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,720
I remember like who the hell was Tricksie.

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Tricksie.

175
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I remember Tricksie.

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Sure.

177
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Andrew Dado.

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
There's another one for you.

179
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
He's on the list.

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
I've got him on the list.

181
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Ah.

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
You know.

183
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm sorry.

184
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Wendy Westbrook.

185
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Oh, she was cute.

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Wasn't she in like a kind of a.

187
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I don't know.

188
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
She was.

189
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
She was.

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Yeah.

191
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
No, no.

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
She was.

193
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
She was.

194
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
She was someone.

195
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
It's Wendy Westbrook.

196
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Everybody.

197
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
I do it.

198
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Yes.

199
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
She was a radio chick.

200
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
That's why yes.

201
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Like kind of a Tom Boyer's thing.

202
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Yeah.

203
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Radio chicks are kind of Tom Boyer's.

204
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Yeah.

205
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Well, there's a long list of names here.

206
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,720
And the post MTV successes you pointed out.

207
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
The other day has been pretty disastrous.

208
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Well, it's so hard.

209
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,720
You know, it's like, you know that once you've been an MTV VJ, you basically can't

210
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
be anything else but that.

211
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
It's certainly not in show business.

212
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
I don't think I got what I got on the swamp thing.

213
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
I had a pretty successful radio career.

214
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
But that was.

215
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
The thing I hate about still have that somewhere.

216
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
God, the swamp thing.

217
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm sure I have the video.

218
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
It's a great episode.

219
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Christina could watch it for the longest time because it actually scared her.

220
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
It scared her.

221
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Yes.

222
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
She thought it was very crap.

223
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
It was funny crap.

224
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
But it was crap.

225
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Awesome.

226
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I was.

227
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I was good.

228
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
I was good.

229
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
I was good.

230
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Like washed up rock star.

231
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Uh-huh.

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Talk about your type casting.

233
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,720
But yeah, I mean, you know, there have been some people like Daisy.

234
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
You know, he said, she had a lot of success.

235
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Certainly after she hooked up modeling.

236
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
What's his name?

237
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Miguel Luis Miguel or whatever.

238
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Yeah, but she was already doing it.

239
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I think she was a ravlon girl.

240
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,720
I've always, always, always love Daisy.

241
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I did too.

242
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
She was a really, really cool chick.

243
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah.

244
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
And she was gorgeous.

245
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah.

246
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
And she let me feel her.

247
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Yeah.

248
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,720
We had Nina Allen, Mark J.J. and Martha were the original five MTV VJs.

249
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Martha has retired and is got two kids and lives in Malibu with her husband.

250
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Really?

251
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Really?

252
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,720
And commercial soundtracks and Martha really doesn't have a big desire to work.

253
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
She's really happy being a mom.

254
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Would she live in the cage?

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Well, we were not to fast, not to fast.

256
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Okay.

257
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Does she live in the colony?

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Of Malibu?

259
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Of Malibu?

260
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
In the colony?

261
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Yeah.

262
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
I don't know exactly.

263
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,720
They just moved to Malibu from the Hollywood Hills this last summer.

264
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Hmm.

265
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Okay.

266
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
How old are kids?

267
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
So kids are like eight nine from like that?

268
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Oh, God.

269
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
You know, I just don't know with Martha and the kids at this zoo.

270
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,720
No, her youngest is like three or four.

271
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Probably three-ish.

272
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,720
And then the older is six, seven.

273
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
For extra points, what are their names?

274
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Maizee and Dylan.

275
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Oh, okay.

276
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Cool.

277
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
And we're talking out at the Central Park Zoo.

278
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
And our husband's nice, school.

279
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Yeah.

280
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Jordan Tarlo used to be the guitarist for a band called The Fuzz Tones, which were an early 120-minute

281
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
MTV band.

282
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Oh.

283
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Yeah.

284
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,720
They met, you know, it was funny because everybody thought Nina was the party girl.

285
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,720
And Martha was the girl next door when, in fact, Nina was born.

286
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
And it was the home body.

287
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Yeah.

288
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,720
And Martha was going out with stiff baders from large of the new church.

289
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Oh, that's right.

290
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
What was this?

291
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
What was the song?

292
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Stuff in Martha's muffin.

293
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
What was that?

294
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Stuff in Martha's muffin.

295
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I can't remember who did that.

296
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
It was.

297
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Fuck.

298
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Wasn't that from the Georgia's not Georgia satellites?

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
When it was me.

300
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
It'll come to me when Roger.

301
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
George Thurgood or something like that?

302
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
I don't know.

303
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Brittany Spears.

304
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Abba.

305
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
So that's Martha.

306
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,720
But of the remaining four Nina Mark and JJ all ended up going back into radio.

307
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
You know, Nina spent a couple years on entertainment tonight.

308
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
And I think she did solve it.

309
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Wait a minute.

310
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Wait a minute.

311
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Didn't.

312
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Was it with Martha one second?

313
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Didn't she do a nagsima commercial?

314
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Yeah.

315
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
That was she did.

316
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
She did a few commercials after she left.

317
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Did she ever do like time life?

318
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Time life things.

319
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Collections CDs.

320
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
She may have.

321
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,720
I know Mark Goodman and Ellen and Ellen Hunter both did because I remember sitting up late party

322
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
and at like two in the morning and watching my my buddies.

323
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Fuck time like time life products.

324
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
I never did.

325
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
I never did.

326
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,720
I placed paid the extra money so I could fly first class.

327
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
I just thought, you know, I did certain places.

328
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I, you know, if you're a celebrity, you just have to.

329
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
I can't find it.

330
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I can't find it.

331
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Well, there was a day when MTV flew all of their talent first class.

332
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
And, you know, that was before they got cheated.

333
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,720
It was corporate and they ruined it.

334
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
It was so much.

335
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
There were stupid rules.

336
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,720
You know, like if the flight is less than three hours it has to.

337
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
I remember that.

338
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Oh, yeah.

339
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
And here was the caveat.

340
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
And less.

341
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
There's another VJ on the plane.

342
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Who is entitled to first class?

343
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
It's that point.

344
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
I was to bump the person in coach up to first class.

345
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
So anyone.

346
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Everyone wanted to fly away.

347
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,720
No, they take you aside and they say, now you just don't ever put a VJ in coach on the same plane with somebody in first and we don't ever have to go there.

348
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
So yeah, exactly.

349
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Certain people got to fly with their makeup artists and, you know, did their makeup artists fly from them.

350
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Julie Brown.

351
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,720
And you know, I love Julie, but I spent a great deal of time negotiating crap over who flew.

352
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Where?

353
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Oh, my.

354
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
I remember that.

355
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
I remember the angst.

356
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
I remember seeing it on your face.

357
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
It was just ridiculous.

358
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
You know, I was just like, get on the plane.

359
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
You know, you got to show.

360
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
I take it on the plane.

361
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Wait, you're going way too fast.

362
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
I mean, listen, we got to talk about Ted Demi.

363
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,720
We got to talk about Rick Kalman.

364
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I mean, we can't just talk about the VJs.

365
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I mean, there's a lot of people.

366
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,720
I guess I was following up on your point.

367
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
The track record for VJs has been made.

368
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
That's right.

369
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Let's go.

370
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Let's say when say there is certain people like Nina Allen.

371
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Well, JJ died.

372
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Nina Mark and JJ all got into radio.

373
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
JJ unfortunately.

374
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Yes, passed away last March.

375
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,720
But the original for a VJ is now three minus JJ and Martha, who's retired are doing a serious

376
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:30,720
video network best of the eight.

377
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Are on on one satellite channel?

378
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Yes.

379
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Interesting.

380
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,720
And so it's like 80 all eighties.

381
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Yeah.

382
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
I keep getting those offers.

383
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
I get offers like that all the time.

384
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
People want me to, you know, host eighties.

385
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Everything from eighties, sock hops.

386
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Well, I tell you they, you know, they pay what they pay really well.

387
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Allen I've been talking to.

388
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Allen's the whole other story.

389
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
That's interesting.

390
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,720
He owns a film company.

391
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
I remember because I hooked up with him with that.

392
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I was an MTV VJ too.

393
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
And he was telling me about it.

394
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
It seemed like he was into some pretty interesting shit.

395
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Oh, Allen's rock.

396
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
And he's got a hell of a place set up down in Birmingham, Alabama.

397
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
How about that's where he was from.

398
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
And, you know, Allen's doing really good.

399
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
But he said, you know, he sits down once a week.

400
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
And he does the segments there and his computer.

401
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720
And they get, you know, voice over IP, off the serious.

402
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
And, you know, that's it.

403
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Done boom.

404
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
That's a thanks man hour.

405
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
Right.

406
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Jack's Berlin.

407
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Cool.

408
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
So that's pretty much it for that group.

409
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
And then there was.

410
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,720
But do they identify themselves as a high?

411
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
I'm not a good man.

412
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
I'm sorry.

413
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Allen Hunter.

414
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
I doubt it.

415
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm out on Hunter.

416
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
And I used to be on MTV.

417
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Can they say that they were on MTV?

418
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Do they do that?

419
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
And not show?

420
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Because, you know, that was a big problem.

421
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
They probably do.

422
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
They must.

423
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
But you remember when you do 100.

424
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Do you remember how pissed off everybody was coming?

425
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I'm sorry.

426
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
I'm sorry.

427
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
You're my guest.

428
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Please go ahead.

429
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Well, I stepped on you.

430
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,720
All I was going to say is if you go to serious.com and look it up.

431
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
It's like best of the 80s.

432
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,720
And it completely identifies them as the original MTV VJs.

433
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Okay.

434
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Now, do you remember how much shit I got from MTV?

435
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Because I would be identified as Adam Curry from MTV on the radio.

436
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Yeah.

437
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,720
But at one point it got negotiated that you were allowed to mention your TV guy.

438
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
I think.

439
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Oh, that's right.

440
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
I was on the on TV.

441
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Yeah.

442
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,720
And then in return, you would plug your MTV shows on your.

443
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I was probably the top 30 hit list.

444
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Yeah.

445
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
God.

446
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
I negotiated that.

447
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Yeah.

448
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
Very good.

449
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Carefully negotiated cross mentions.

450
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
You know, can by the way.

451
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Once you with me.

452
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Uh, during the MTV.com lawsuit.

453
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Oh, goodness.

454
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Yes.

455
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Yeah.

456
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
You, you, you, you, you still have all that crap can.

457
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
I moved it with me.

458
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
I have all that fucking shit.

459
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
The cases of files.

460
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Yep.

461
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I haven't even the, the three and a half inch floppies.

462
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
All the printouts.

463
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
All the legal documents.

464
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Joe Donnelly.

465
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Remember him?

466
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I was just going to say that lawsuit proved one thing if one thing only.

467
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,720
It really pays to have a really, really, really good lawyer.

468
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Yeah.

469
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,720
And we really pay him a shitload of money too.

470
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Well, I don't know.

471
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
We're like $250,000.

472
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I don't think MTV thought that, you know, you would, I, I think, you know,

473
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Viacom and MTV typically in those situations.

474
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Expect the little guy to curl up in a ball and say you win, you win, I give.

475
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
You know, they should have just asked for the asked for it.

476
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
If they'd asked me, I would have given it to you.

477
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
You didn't.

478
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,720
You know, I think you surprised them because you didn't curl up in a ball.

479
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
That's, that's I think we can probably say that.

480
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
But I totally pulled it.

481
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
David and Goliath in the press on them.

482
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
That work pretty well.

483
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Exactly.

484
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
And in fact, it was the pressing me.

485
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,720
It was probably the best thing for, for getting you in the press and launching your new endeavor,

486
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,720
which was the web and on ramp after MTV.

487
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
The press that came out of that was the best press that money could buy.

488
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
That's right.

489
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,720
You haven't even been looking good no matter what anybody said.

490
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
You came off looking good and it came off looking good.

491
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Like fucker.

492
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Yeah.

493
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Do you have any press clippings still?

494
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Yeah.

495
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I've got boxes of stuff.

496
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Do you have any of those particular press clippings?

497
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Yeah.

498
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Then I'm not sure about that.

499
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
That was in a separate file.

500
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
We're depressing.

501
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm sorry.

502
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
I'm sorry.

503
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
We're digressing.

504
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
That would be somewhere else like in a curry co-on ramp.

505
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
A few ideas of file.

506
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
I've got the MTV files here.

507
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Yeah.

508
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Okay.

509
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,720
I still have boxes and boxes of three quarter inch tape, too.

510
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,720
And there's some really funny stuff on them if they haven't molded.

511
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,720
You know, I have the outtake reel.

512
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I have, that's the one that we're Julie says.

513
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Kiss my clip.

514
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I have that one.

515
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
It's a great reel.

516
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
I love that reel.

517
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
And Kevin Seal.

518
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Kevin Seal is like,

519
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
She got all Dave Diner account too.

520
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Yeah.

521
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Dave Diner.

522
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
That's right.

523
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Dave Diner was a four manager.

524
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
I like Dave Diner.

525
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
I liked him.

526
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
He reminded me of my dad.

527
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
He was very dry.

528
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Very dry.

529
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
He was cool.

530
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Yeah.

531
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
He was all right.

532
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
He made me laugh.

533
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Gosh, man.

534
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Well, some of them were poor in our camera.

535
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
I wonder if Warren is still on camera.

536
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I bet you.

537
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Warren or Celeste has probably still there.

538
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
You know, shriveled up in a corner.

539
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Camp.

540
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,720
It's got to be on a handheld with a tripod.

541
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,720
You know, because MTV, they wouldn't really want to do things to you.

542
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Either you aged at twice to speed or it stopped you from

543
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
aging during the time you were there.

544
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
That's right.

545
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
For you, for the good people,

546
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,720
it stopped us from aging during the time we were there.

547
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Yeah.

548
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Well, you know,

549
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,720
you were talking about the camera people.

550
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Operators.

551
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
And not only them, but, you know,

552
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Jeff on Cairon, you know,

553
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
the, the Cairon is the,

554
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
that's what they bring, you know,

555
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
the letters they bring up.

556
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
So, you know,

557
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
with your name or whatever.

558
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
And we had a great guy,

559
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
the Cairon operator Jeff,

560
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
because he couldn't spell.

561
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
That was like,

562
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
You know,

563
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
like the first required because it was,

564
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
it was, you know,

565
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
and Rick would audio and just a feedback with the crew.

566
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Otherwise,

567
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
you're sitting there and a fucking dead studio.

568
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Talking shit without seeing the videos, you know?

569
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Have you talked to Rick recently?

570
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
You keep sending that.

571
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
I mean,

572
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
I have more recently than I have, I think.

573
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
I looked up a couple.

574
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
He visited you once in Amsterdam.

575
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
I think that was,

576
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,720
That was, oh, that was a well back, but I saw him in New York and we kept in touch a little bit, he's a sex-fiend.

577
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
I got, he's in all kinds of...

578
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Yeah, I don't know.

579
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
He's always into somebody.

580
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,720
He's married for a long time and had a lovely wife and a lovely relationship.

581
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Joe and I decided he wanted to have sex with lesbians.

582
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
And I'm like, yeah, I get it.

583
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Lesbians Swedish made.

584
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Yeah, she was cool.

585
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Anyway, so, um, who was next?

586
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Then I came in to talk about women.

587
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
You, you, you don't have never asked you, will you?

588
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,720
I've never asked you exactly what that was like from your end.

589
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
I remember coming in.

590
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I remember my first day.

591
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I remember what it was like.

592
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
But I don't think you've ever told me what it was like on the other side.

593
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Because, you know, they've apparently hired some geek.

594
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:36,720
I remember you and Julie and Daisy and Kevin Seel starting probably more than anybody else,

595
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
because down the road after that, they kept turning over.

596
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
And you know, I hear a comes another one.

597
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
So, who did you come in?

598
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
Oh, Kevin Seel came in first, I bet, right?

599
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Because that was a part of the...

600
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Kevin Seel was the one they did, the Great College VJs.

601
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Right.

602
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,720
When to college campuses around the United States and auditioned people and out of thousands of people,

603
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
somehow they ended up with Kevin Seel.

604
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,720
His audition was truly brilliant, although as it turned out later, he may have been on mushrooms at the time.

605
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Kevin Seel is one of the most talented comedians I have ever met in my life, and he is completely disadvantaged.

606
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,720
He is completely deranged and podcasted by the way, would be perfect for him.

607
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Last I heard from Kevin, he was married, he was in Seattle.

608
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,720
I believe he had kids, and I think he had gone and done something.

609
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Remember, he was an engineering major.

610
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
He was fucking brilliant.

611
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
He was brilliant.

612
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Well, yeah, but I think he's actually building bridges or something.

613
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Did...

614
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
He was hanging out with Bernie, right?

615
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Remember Bernie?

616
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Hmm.

617
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Bernie, our receptionist, our emergency.

618
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Bernie does it.

619
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Bernie does it.

620
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Yeah.

621
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
The emergency were friends, frankly.

622
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
And they probably still talk.

623
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
I've lost that baby.

624
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
She was great.

625
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
She was a hoot dough.

626
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Oh man, she was so cool.

627
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
She was whacked.

628
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Well, how would Stern used to call our studio all the time in the morning live?

629
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
And he would talk to her, right?

630
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
And try to get through to Steve leads.

631
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
And Steve leads emailed me.

632
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
What's he doing?

633
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
He's consulting for serious.

634
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
He probably got...

635
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Of course, there's a link.

636
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
He's like, you got marches out on the ground.

637
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,720
We'd remember going back to your question of what it was like when you guys started.

638
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,720
I mean, it was really strange because, you know, original VJs had left.

639
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
And it was family.

640
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,720
And everybody was really kind of very nervous about how this was going to be.

641
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
And what it was going to be like with new people.

642
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Right.

643
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,720
And I can't remember whether you came first or Julie or Kevin A.

644
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
I don't know.

645
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,720
But I remember, you know, Julie was on TV and...

646
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
She wasn't...

647
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Like a dancer on television.

648
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Yeah, something.

649
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
She was...

650
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
She was that.

652
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
And she was also doing like TV AM or something.

653
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
And they had flown her over to do an audition.

654
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
And I remember coming over and being very British and very nervous.

655
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Really?

656
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Really.

657
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,720
You see, the thing with Julie Brown, the thing with Julie Brown.

658
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Sorry for interrupting you, Ken.

659
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Is that she was...

660
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,720
The perfect example of why MTV was fucked up from day one.

661
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
We're not from day one.

662
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
But, you know, when these...

663
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,720
When the new people came in because Julie off camera was fucking hilarious.

664
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I mean, we...

665
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Very much.

666
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
We had to stop.

667
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,720
I mean, people were in stitches dying on the floor.

668
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
It was just so hilarious.

669
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
And the foul mouth...

670
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
I mean, she...

671
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
No one had anything on her.

672
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
And it was funny.

673
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
It was really...

674
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Funny.

675
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
But, you know, that was not the stuff that MTV aired.

676
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
What they aired was...

677
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
No, they were...

678
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
The...

679
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
The...

680
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
The...

681
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
It was boring.

682
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
And then she turned around and said, okay, it's my clip.

683
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
And it was like, ah!

684
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
She was...

685
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Jennifer...

686
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Jennifer...

687
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
And Ab Fab...

688
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Way before their time.

689
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I'm just...

690
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Well, I'm sorry, not Joan Rivers.

691
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
But she was before Ab Fab.

692
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
She probably already had stolen a lot of her...

693
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Or...

694
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
But it was influenced by a...

695
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
By a lot of that British humor that I'm seeing here.

696
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
But she was great.

697
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
And that just never made it on the air.

698
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
No.

699
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Unfortunately, the funny stuff didn't all go on...

700
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Oh, and Julie, by the way, is married to a...

701
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
For foul player?

702
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
No, no, no.

703
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Baseball?

704
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
No, nothing like that.

705
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Oh, like a guy with boats?

706
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Like a guy with boats?

707
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
No, he's...

708
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Yeah, but he's like a real estate guy.

709
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I...

710
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Yeah.

711
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
It's got money.

712
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Like a developer.

713
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Yeah, he's got money.

714
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Yeah, right now.

715
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,720
And he has a daughter that was very, very young when he and Julie got married.

716
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,720
So Julie's basically raised his child as her own.

717
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
And Julie, I think, is probably one of the world's best moms.

718
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
And is very, very happy.

719
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
And not doing a lot of work either.

720
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
She...

721
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
She...

722
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
They're in California.

723
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Wasn't she married to that model?

724
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
First, can, like, some male model that she was with?

725
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I don't know.

726
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
She was actually married.

727
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Whenever married there, that was her fiance, Chris.

728
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
She was from England with her to New York.

729
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Oh, that's...

730
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,720
And during the time that they were in New York together,

731
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
he, in fact,

732
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
funny sidebar.

733
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,720
But back, before Mariah Carey was Mariah Carey,

734
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,720
she used to work at a sports bar on the opposite side of Manhattan.

735
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Yeah.

736
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
And he was on some rugby team.

737
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Right.

738
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I remember that.

739
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
She'd always have to go pick him up after he played.

740
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Right.

741
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Well, apparently, she...

742
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Julie caught Chris in Demariah Carey.

743
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Let me tell you.

744
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
If I had to line him up next to each other,

745
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
I'd totally go from Mariah Carey.

746
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Oh, totally.

747
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Totally.

748
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
But I bet you, Julie.

749
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
But Julie, I bet you was hot in the sack,

750
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
because, you know, she did Billy Idol.

751
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
I mean, that's pretty cool.

752
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Anyway, Chris ran off with all her money

753
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
and started to succeed this week.

754
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
No.

755
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
We clubbed in California.

756
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
Oh, that's horrible.

757
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
What happened after that?

758
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
He ran off with her in the street.

759
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Well, she didn't have any money.

760
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
She didn't have any real money.

761
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
She didn't have any real money.

762
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
She didn't have any real money.

763
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
But she didn't have any real money.

764
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I mean, she was living paycheck to paycheck like the rest.

765
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Actually, she did.

766
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
I mean, she...

767
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
She...

768
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
She'd saved up some money in England,

769
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
and they owned a house.

770
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
And, you know, she was...

771
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
She was doing okay there.

772
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
MTV is...

773
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Well, and...

774
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Hmm.

775
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,720
You and Julie, I think, were probably the two that...

776
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,720
I have no idea if they pay like they used to.

777
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
And I'm sure, you know,

778
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
oh, people like Carson Daily got to a point

779
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
where they were proud.

780
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
He must have very good money.

781
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
He must have been made to know that.

782
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
At least 200,000.

783
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
I bet he was making 200,000.

784
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Not much more.

785
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
But, you know, that's why...

786
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
You did make at least 200,000 to live like a neighbor.

787
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Like a neighbor in Manhattan these days, so...

788
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Yeah.

789
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Well, but, you know, you get all your appearances,

790
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
and all the other shit if you...

791
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
I never really did that.

792
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I only did that to promote my radio shows.

793
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
I didn't do fucking store openings.

794
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Although, I did do...

795
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Like the Popeyes.

796
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
The Popeyes, yes.

797
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
The Popeyes chicken grand opening.

798
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Okay, fuck you.

799
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
You weren't going to bring that up, can.

800
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
He...

801
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Where was that?

802
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Where was that?

803
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
I don't remember where it was.

804
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
It was down the south, like New Orleans...

805
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
No, no, New Orleans was great.

806
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,720
You'd have to fly off and do another silly radio promo.

807
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,720
And I think I learned an awful lot working for you in those years

808
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,720
because there are no silly or people, and there's no silly or business

809
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
and syndicated...

810
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
I said the kid in front of you.

811
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Everybody, how are you doing?

812
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
I mean, that is silly shit.

813
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Christina says hi, she can't hear you,

814
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
but she's in the room.

815
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
Yeah, it's Ken.

816
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Yeah, Ken.

817
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Your buddy Ken.

818
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Well, tell her I said hello.

819
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Yeah.

820
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
He says hi.

821
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,720
For people that didn't sound very enthusiastic,

822
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,720
it's hard to explain to people the relationship I have with Christina,

823
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
which we don't really have at this point.

824
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
But I mean...

825
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
She loves you better.

826
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
She still loves you.

827
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Your daughter and I were very much in love when I was in my late 20s

828
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
and she was too.

829
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Right.

830
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Right.

831
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,720
And let's just explain because at a certain point...

832
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Quite enough fair.

833
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,720
When did I ask you to come work for me and leave MTV?

834
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
God, I was really fucking with him.

835
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Right.

836
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
93.

837
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
93.

838
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
Really was that late.

839
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
So it was like...

840
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
92.

841
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
93.

842
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
It was around there.

843
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Right.

844
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Right.

845
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
Right.

846
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Right.

847
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
And so...

848
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
When was the occasion?

849
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Why did I need you?

850
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,720
You had fired...

851
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Ivan.

852
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
The Joan Jet People.

853
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Oh, right.

854
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Kenny.

855
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Kenny Laguna.

856
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
That was so ugly.

857
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
That was so fucking ugly.

858
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
But you know...

859
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Kenny was a great guy.

860
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
But Steve Lieber was hard to deal with.

861
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Well...

862
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
There were arosimists.

863
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
It was the one that they fired.

864
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Yeah.

865
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
You would come to New York and you had done the appropriate thing.

866
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
You had hired publicist.

867
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
You had hired agents.

868
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
You'd hired managers.

869
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
And you know, I think at the end of the day,

870
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
you realize that maybe you don't need all that crap.

871
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
No.

872
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
You can do yourself.

873
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Yeah.

874
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Exactly.

875
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
There's no point in paying somebody a percentage like that.

876
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
But a lot of people have done.

877
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,720
And you were actually pretty early on in doing it.

878
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
But you said, I don't need all these people.

879
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
I just need to hire somebody.

880
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Yeah.

881
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
On staff who can take care of a lot of those day-to-day functions.

882
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,720
And then keep the agent because they only make a percent if they bring the money in.

883
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Yeah.

884
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
But check this.

885
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
You also hire the manager.

886
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
It makes a percent of everything you make.

887
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Right.

888
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Fuckers.

889
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Fucking bandits.

890
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
So you walked into my office one day.

891
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,720
And I was, you know, I'd been there for nine years.

892
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,720
And the vibe of what was going on at the channel had changed considerably.

893
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Who was running the show then?

894
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Because we should talk about that one time.

895
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Who was running the show?

896
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,720
What light switch was the operation light switch?

897
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Was it this time?

898
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
On what level?

899
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Ah, who was, what was the production?

900
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
What were we doing?

901
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Remember we had all those different phases that we went through.

902
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
And we had the blue screens.

903
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
And then we had, you know, five seconds of talking.

904
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
You know, that shit.

905
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Remember how we went through all that?

906
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720
I think we'd kind of almost come full circle.

907
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,720
We were, we had gone down to 42nd and rebuilt a big real life set again at that.

908
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
That's the new studio.

909
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Yeah, those were nine.

910
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Yeah.

911
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
That was cool.

912
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:09,720
And, you know, things had gone a little bit back to, you know, normal VJ day parts and actual segments that, you know, were more than two seconds.

913
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
I bet you the radio guys were backing.

914
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
What was his name?

915
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Andy, Andy.

916
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Who was programmed right?

917
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Andy.

918
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Something.

919
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
He was.

920
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
I bet you he was in.

921
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Because it was running like radio again.

922
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Yeah.

923
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Yeah.

924
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
He was a guy that it didn't care.

925
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Andy's shown.

926
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Andy's shown.

927
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Andy's shown.

928
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Yeah.

929
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Because he had.

930
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Yeah.

931
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Yeah.

932
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
He had known Kennedy.

933
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Kennedy, by the way, is no longer in the business.

934
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,720
I think she's, she's, no, we know what Kennedy's doing.

935
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
No, no, we know what Kennedy's doing.

936
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
No, no, we know what Kennedy's doing.

937
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,720
No, no, we know what Kennedy's doing.

938
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:58,720
I'm just going to show some kind of bad.

939
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
TV show somewhere.

940
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Always kind of, you know, the hip Republican as it were.

941
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
That's why I hated her.

942
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
And they said, well, they've, they've really dusted her off.

943
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Remember when she fucked up my ass?

944
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Can that?

945
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Why did you fuck up your, do you remember that?

946
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Well, I told the source of listeners who was my thigh.

947
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
It really was my thigh.

948
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
It really was my thigh.

949
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Yes, I heard it.

950
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
And yeah, I do.

951
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
I've forgotten about that.

952
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
That was fucked up.

953
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
I've forgotten about that.

954
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,720
I don't think I was there at the time.

955
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
I was at the beach house.

956
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
That was very cool.

957
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
The beach house concept was fucking great.

958
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
The first time.

959
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Yeah.

960
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,720
And you know, that always pissed me off because those fuckers never let me come.

961
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
Never let you know.

962
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,720
That was like the VMA.

963
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Because there'd be one or two of you at the beach house.

964
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
And everybody else would be back in the studio.

965
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,720
So they felt it was better to have me back at the studio than out at the beach house.

966
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
We needed you to run the ship to Ken.

967
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,720
We needed to know that there's strong firm hand was on the wheel at all times.

968
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Yeah.

969
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
And besides that, we just haven't too much fun.

970
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
We're having too much fun.

971
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm on our old makeup artist in New York.

972
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
On the last year.

973
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Do you meet?

974
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Do you meet?

975
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
My trips to New York.

976
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
I was walking through the village.

977
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
And there was Keon before me.

978
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Oh, Keon.

979
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Oh, my God.

980
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
For Keon.

981
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Yeah, of course.

982
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
How's Keon?

983
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
No, of course not.

984
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Don't touch me.

985
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Be honest.

986
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Well, no.

987
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Your wife was the only one that was led to do your makeup.

988
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Yeah.

989
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
And my hair.

990
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
And your hair.

991
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Well, you came in done.

992
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
And you were always funny.

993
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
You know, everybody else would come in and sweat and take an hour and a half to get

994
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
ready.

995
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,720
You'd come in 30 seconds after you were supposed to be on the set and just kind of walk in the

996
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
door and throw your jacket over the stool.

997
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
I always be like 30 seconds late.

998
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
Right.

999
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
I just strolling.

1000
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Well, you were always calling from the tunnel.

1001
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
You know, you're right there.

1002
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
We're like ready.

1003
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
You know.

1004
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
You're ready.

1005
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:52,720
You're ready.

1006
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
We're always in the tunnel.

1007
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Right.

1008
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
But the time you ran out of gas in the tunnel.

1009
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Oh, dude.

1010
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Oh, you're in a Rolls Royce.

1011
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
Let me tell you.

1012
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,720
A quick way to make yourself really hated in New York is to run out of gas in a Rolls Royce

1013
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
in the afternoon.

1014
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,720
I broke down to the Honda, but everybody thought, sorry for me.

1015
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,720
And they come out with this god awful yellow thing with these two big, big bumpers

1016
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
and literally just bump their ass out of the way.

1017
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
It just bump you all the way.

1018
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,720
And the Rolls when it's not when the engine's not running, you have no power steering.

1019
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,720
And so it's like this little, this little wheel like this grandma thin wheel that you know,

1020
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,720
you're pulling with all your might and it's like, you know, the thing is creaking

1021
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
and the tie issues.

1022
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
That was a horrendous experience.

1023
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,720
And everyone that wronging and flipping the urge caused me a great deal of stress over the many years

1024
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
that I worked for.

1025
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Shit.

1026
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Well, I had it for 90,000 miles.

1027
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,720
That Rolls caused me a great deal of stress over those 90,000.

1028
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Why?

1029
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Just because of all the payments we had to make for it.

1030
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
That we could never make.

1031
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
It was a very expensive car.

1032
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
And be even to have a spark plug change.

1033
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
It was like thousands of dollars.

1034
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
I paid per spark.

1035
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,720
You know, they'd have to import the spark plug and the wrench and the guy to turn it from one to two.

1036
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
Oh, that was funny.

1037
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Oh, man.

1038
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Hey, listen.

1039
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Remember you traded that hand on, what did you trade that for?

1040
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
I did trade it.

1041
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
I gave it away.

1042
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
All right.

1043
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
But I mean, you switched to a Ford Explorer then.

1044
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
Yeah.

1045
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
One of the kind that blows up.

1046
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
No, those didn't blow up.

1047
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
They tipped over.

1048
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
The tiptoe, right?

1049
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Yeah.

1050
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
It was a national emergency.

1051
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
No, it was a drive.

1052
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
I'm sorry.

1053
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Medical emergency.

1054
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
Which dot com license plate.

1055
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
You better have your ass ready.

1056
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
We're going to work.

1057
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
I'm like, are you crazy?

1058
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,720
It's a state of emergency.

1059
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
It was the blizzard.

1060
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Remember we wasn't at the blizzard that we went that we drove in.

1061
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,720
And everyone was was putting pictures up on the web and stuff.

1062
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
Yeah.

1063
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Yeah.

1064
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
What was that?

1065
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
The blizzard of what?

1066
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,720
Ninety.

1067
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Fifty six, seven.

1068
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Ninety.

1069
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Ninety six, ninety seven, summer, was nine six.

1070
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Ninety six.

1071
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,720
Nina's shorty of six.

1072
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
I had the dot com license plates.

1073
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Then it was.

1074
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Ninety six.

1075
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Ninety six and nineteen.

1076
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Right.

1077
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,720
And Lou, to our housekeeper.

1078
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,720
Were you able to take a charitable deduction for that?

1079
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
No, fuck it.

1080
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,720
It wasn't worth more than $5,000 by the time we got rid of it.

1081
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
It was shot.

1082
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
They still drive it around.

1083
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Fireman and then.

1084
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
It's still driving around for a moment.

1085
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Yes, yes.

1086
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
Absolutely.

1087
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
I'm so excited to take it out.

1088
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,720
The Duchess, they still call it.

1089
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
That's not it.

1090
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Listen, Ken.

1091
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
It's been like 30 minutes to tell you what.

1092
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Why don't we continue?

1093
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,720
And do some more like another time and make this into a series.

1094
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
This is great.

1095
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Wait, I didn't say that, right?

1096
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
I would love to.

1097
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Oh, that's so surreal.

1098
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,720
That's seriously because you trained me.

1099
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Ah, I trained you so well.

1100
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
I would love to.

1101
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I would love to.

1102
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Well, Adam had a thing.

1103
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Anybody that worked for Adam.

1104
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,720
If he asked you to do something, he wanted you to respond.

1105
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
I would love to.

1106
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
No, that's not true.

1107
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
What are you talking about?

1108
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
It was the joke.

1109
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
It was a joke.

1110
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
But he was an ongoing joke.

1111
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Yeah, just either say no or I would love to.

1112
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
I would love to.

1113
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
I would love to.

1114
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Did I ever tell you that Barry Nelson who was my assistant at

1115
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Think?

1116
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
When you were running the traffic department.

1117
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
Your final good assistant.

1118
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Yeah.

1119
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Oh, God.

1120
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
That he was on.

1121
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
You had it run there.

1122
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,720
He was on who wants to be a millionaire?

1123
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
No.

1124
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Yeah.

1125
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
And he had me listed as one of the people's calling case.

1126
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
You needed to help line.

1127
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Yeah, I think he did.

1128
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
It was like, I never saw that.

1129
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Well, I didn't see it.

1130
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
I presume it aired.

1131
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
But he was on.

1132
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
So he called me and he was like really excited.

1133
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
And see, can I kind of list you as a number?

1134
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
Yeah, fuck an eye.

1135
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Of course, the time they were taping was like three o'clock in the morning.

1136
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
My time, right?

1137
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
And so I went to bed at night.

1138
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,720
They call you up and get you ready to do it and stuff?

1139
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
No.

1140
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Eventually around around three a.m. or whatever.

1141
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
And I'm like, oh, my God.

1142
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
I'm going to suck.

1143
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
I'm like completely.

1144
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
I go.

1145
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Oh, I know.

1146
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Oh, I know.

1147
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Here you are in the air completely asleep.

1148
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Yeah, but it was.

1149
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,720
It was Ed.

1150
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,720
It was Ed.

1151
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Yeah.

1152
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Calling to say that, you know, they wouldn't call me because Barry.

1153
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,720
He got like, I think he did $12,000 or was it $8,000?

1154
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
What's the level?

1155
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
$8,000 or $12,000?

1156
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I have no retention for numeric.

1157
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Yeah.

1158
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
And that's and that's all he did.

1159
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
And I never heard again from him.

1160
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
I'm sure he's okay.

1161
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
He'll get in touch again.

1162
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,720
I'm sure he's out there somewhere.

1163
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,720
But yeah, we'll have to continue this because we didn't even.

1164
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
You know, I made a list here.

1165
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,720
There were 37 members of the MTV air talent.

1166
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
No.

1167
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
That I weigh.

1168
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Thirty or seven.

1169
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Thirty or seven.

1170
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Eight.

1171
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Unbelievable.

1172
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Oh, my God.

1173
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
But there's so many other things we can.

1174
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
We should do this.

1175
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
We should give this a name and just do this from time to time.

1176
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,720
And just shoot the shit because between the two of us,

1177
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
we have what?

1178
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Twenty years of MTV history we can talk about?

1179
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Yeah.

1180
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Wow.

1181
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,720
We can get zipped cream to sponsor it.

1182
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,720
I could still use some.

1183
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Right.

1184
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Right on girlfriend.

1185
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,720
I'm still at a lesson.

1186
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Okay.

1187
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Well, good.

1188
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Let's do this again tomorrow whenever we feel like it.

1189
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Whenever we hook up.

1190
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
This is fun.

1191
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Okay.

1192
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
We could just call out the MTV Chronicles.

1193
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Something like that.

1194
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Something like hokey.

1195
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
The MTV Chronicles.

1196
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
You're going to write a book.

1197
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
You're going to do a book.

1198
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Was it going to be called?

1199
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
I know.

1200
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Oh.

1201
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Clean the title.

1202
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Inside MTV.

1203
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
My life in the trenches.

1204
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Yeah.

1205
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Excellent.

1206
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Or my time in the trenches.

1207
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
But no.

1208
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
It was inside MTV.

1209
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
My time in the trenches.

1210
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
It was going to be my personal book.

1211
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
No.

1212
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
There's a book to be written somewhere.

1213
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
It's all about time.

1214
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Yeah.

1215
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Well, that's why this is much easier.

1216
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,720
I mean, you don't even like shit on a book anyway.

1217
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
What?

1218
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,720
If somebody's going to pay you a big advance and still write the book.

1219
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
And they have bought your time.

1220
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Then you can afford to sit there for the months that it would take and write.

1221
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Other than that.

1222
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
I don't got time to do it.

1223
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
I'm going to make some money.

1224
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Well, well.

1225
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Hold on a second.

1226
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Listen.

1227
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Listen.

1228
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
You know, fucking.

1229
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Mr. Real Estate.

1230
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,720
You know, Mr. Donald fucking Trump of Portland.

1231
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Let me.

1232
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Let me ask it.

1233
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
How much.

1234
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
How much.

1235
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Would it take to write the book?

1236
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
What kind of advance would you need?

1237
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,720
I don't know.

1238
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
We'd have to talk about that.

1239
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
I have no idea.

1240
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
I mean, I've given a great deal of thought to it.

1241
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
And would it really be a best seller?

1242
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Do you think it would really, it would really, the people really give a shit?

1243
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Mmm.

1244
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Seriously now.

1245
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Probably not.

1246
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
I don't know.

1247
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,720
There's, there's three or four different complete angles.

1248
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
You can take at how to do the thing.

1249
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
It has to be scandalous.

1250
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
It has to be scandalous.

1251
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,720
Otherwise it's not going to be, is it the scandals?

1252
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
You know.

1253
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
The thing is, everyone thinks that there was, you know,

1254
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
MTV was, you know, one big drugged out orgy.

1255
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
And, you know, guess what?

1256
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
It was fun, but it wasn't that fun.

1257
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,720
It, it became a well-oiled assembly line.

1258
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Basically cranking out assembly line television, you know,

1259
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,720
seven days a week, 24 hours a day worth of television.

1260
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
And a Monday through Friday, you know,

1261
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,720
seven, eight hour work day.

1262
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Yeah.

1263
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
There was a science that cranking it out.

1264
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,720
The sure thoughts and quirky personalities that, you know,

1265
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Yeah.

1266
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Added to the mix, but it was by no means a big drugged out party.

1267
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
What was it, Linda?

1268
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Linda?

1269
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
What's her name? Linda?

1270
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
Love lace?

1271
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Yeah, that's the one.

1272
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
All right.

1273
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I listen, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1274
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
We'll do some more of this.

1275
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
This is cool.

1276
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
This is fun.

1277
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Okay. I enjoyed it.

1278
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
All right, very cool.

1279
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Thank you.

1280
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Talk to you soon.

1281
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Love you, Ken.

1282
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Okay, bye-bye.

1283
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Well, there you have it.

1284
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,720
The very first episode of the MTV Chronicles

1285
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
with my friend Ken Clark.

1286
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Let me know what you think.

1287
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,720
If you want to hear another one of these in lieu of regular daily source code,

1288
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,720
or should we make it into a separate feed, a separate feature.

1289
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Add them at curry.com or MP3 feedback at gmail.com.

1290
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,720
And I see that the BT bus is parked outside.

1291
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,720
That means that they're going to hook up the four megabit line today.

1292
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
Ooh, yeah, everybody.

1293
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,720
So we've back tomorrow for the thank-out of Spide 80

1294
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
for the daily source code.

1295
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
Thanks for listening. Hope you enjoyed it.

1296
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Take care.

1297
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Bye-bye.

1298
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Bye-bye.
