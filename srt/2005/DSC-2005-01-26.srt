1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Daily source code 1-26-25 Transmators, we don't need no stinkin' Transmators!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Get ready for the generation of rockin' world!

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Autastic! It's Adam Curry!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's the hump day edition of your daily source code, everybody!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's the power of the door!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's the Wednesday, January 26, 2005, coming to you from Curry Cottage.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm Adam Curry, it's a 122 in the afternoon sitting here on the Louis Vuittie Couture's couch.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Man, we're bumping all over the place today, aren't we?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hey, good afternoon!

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's the power of the door! It's the door!

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's the door! Good morning!

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What evening, depending on when you happen to be checking the show out?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Another 40 minutes jam packed of podcasts, promos, podsafe music.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Everything you get you into is what's going on in podcasts today.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, it's kind of a show about nothing.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Although that would be stealing Jimmy Jetside here.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's just like any other Ed Sullivan type show.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Your daily source code, with good news today, because just arrives by a courier.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The good Charlotte tickets for March at the Brickston Academy.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The power of the door, the power of the door.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That, of course, is for Christina, who asked me, I think sometimes around Christmas,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
she said, that good Charlotte, her favorite band,

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
are playing at Brickston Academy, and she sent me a link.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Where to get tickets.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And I forget the name of this outfit, but it seemed pretty reputable,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
so I just ordered them online.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And then we didn't hear from them.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It was like, oh, well, you know, the tickets are coming,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but it may take up until two weeks before the show.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So we started to get a little bit worried about them actually showing up,

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and of course, but now the show is completely sold out.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So today they arrived by courier.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
March 20th, good Charlotte Brickston Academy.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's going to be a sound seeing tour.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm definitely taken by recording equipment to that gig.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And the last time we saw it, or the first time, and last time,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
so far that we saw them was in Holland at 13,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and I think that's Tilburg, or Tilburg, as we would say.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I was able to get the Christina and her friend,

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I ship backstage, because, well, I know, I know people at the location,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I know the big promoter in Holland, and I said, hey,

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you know, can you see if you can get these girls backstage.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And then once they told the band's manager that and the band,

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
they said, oh, Adam Curry, well, of course, you know,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
we grew up watching him.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you for making me feel so fucking ancient.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now, this time around, of course, I want to be super dad again,

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but I know no one at the Brickston Academy.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know anything about the venue, the promoter, etc.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So if any of the source code listeners in the UK,

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
happen to have an in and can get word to the manager,

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the band that we'll be waiting to go backstage,

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
turn me into super dad again, please, that would be really cool.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And this morning is a drop Christina off, you know,

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
what we do now these days is fill up the iPod,

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
got the iPrip.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I take her to school every single morning just to,

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you know, really just to get going to start my day,

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
then I drive by the new stand, pick up newspapers,

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and I listened to a podcast.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We listened to the daily download this morning,

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and I'm going to play some bits of that later for you.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was the fucking hilarious Christina loved it.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
On the way back, I noticed there was a new yeast radio,

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
my friend, Madge Weinstein.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And the whole show almost like started off,

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you know, with her talking to me,

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which was trippy, you know, I'm sitting there,

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and the car and Madge is yelling at me,

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and yelling at everyone else, and other people

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
joining the conversation.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's just go through this,

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
so you can kind of hear what it was,

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and maybe it can address some of Madge's issues.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm trying to have a podcast.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can keep forgetting to say that,

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
hold on a second.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The daily source code is often not safe for work.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Everybody, this is Fausto,

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and we're with Jason Smith,

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and we're taking pictures.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hi, everybody.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We're all auditioning for you.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was talking gay TV show.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That sounds like there's a lot of fun going on there

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
in the East Radio Studios.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's the sound I hear?

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Ah, it's all kinds of crap going on.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm still at the window open here.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sitting underneath the window in the...

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hear that?

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, okay.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, we'll just have to live with that.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's someone rebuilding their house, I guess.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm not, I'm too old.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Listen, so, um, here's the deal.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now I forgot what I was going to say.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, I'll time for this.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll play this wonderful interview with John Farmy.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But first, I need to talk to Adam Curry.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Alright.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I immediately go, huh?

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Alright, here it comes.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Adam, what's the fucking deal?

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're taking all the goddamn publicity for yourself.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Everybody's calling you,

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because you're the one with the hair.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, I got a hair too, Goddamn.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And I want to, the next time,

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
some fucking network calls, you send them over to Madge,

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
because that's the least you only after that goddamn wine

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
of bullshit on laying on the couch masturbating

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
in South Beach, Fias.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hold on.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, yeah, maybe I was, you know.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So, you'll give a mine number.

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's Madge Weinstein.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The loaded at Mad.com.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's how.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The loaded at Mad.com.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Send them by way.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm funnyer than her anyway.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, Madge, you know I love you.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You know you're funny.

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I wish you didn't live in fucking Chicago,

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
so I wouldn't have to stay up until two in the morning

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
to call you.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, Madge, I will certainly do that.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And I'm sure that will really promote Madge Weinstein anyway.

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Time for the interview with John Vaughment.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I told you this was going to be a quickie,

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but I had to get that little pronouncement

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
announcement out of the way,

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
because I'm sure I'm speaking for a lot of podcasts

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
as when we say, why should she get all the attention?

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
By the way, when I was at the vlog of Tharn,

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I did run into a couple of people that were resentful

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
of the podcast.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Because I'm like, listen, why are you so against podcast?

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And we said, well, it's all about personalities

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and it's basically all about Adam Curry.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, Adam, it's all about Nick.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Show hold on, hold on.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I hear some beages in the background.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Stick an up for me now.

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is getting interesting.

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll tell you fucking kisses.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Kiss it, baby.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Show.

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Faustos taking your side as usual.

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And fucking a, of course she's taking my side.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm taking your side manager, just not hear what I'm saying.

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't want to hear what you're saying.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right, what do you say?

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What?

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What?

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What?

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Self-loaded.

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, sorry.

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It wasn't paying attention.

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Like most of their audience,

164
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
imagine.

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They're probably scanning past this part.

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I have to make this point.

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's okay for it to be about personalities

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
because this is like early cable access.

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's people expressing themselves.

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's a good picture.

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That is a good picture.

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, of course it's about personalities.

173
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Absolutely.

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And it's all about Don and Drew and Mad Weinstein.

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And, and of course, Dave Weiner and the Daily Source Code.

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And yeah, it's all about personalities.

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's about, it's not what blogs are about as well.

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's all about personalities.

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Absolutely.

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In fact, if there's anything that's the problem with regular radio,

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
go turn on any fucking radio station, except for a few

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
personalities who still work that way.

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Everything has been homogenized.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You know, sanitized for your protection.

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Everyone's sitting up there, clear channel, sitting in the DJ farm.

186
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And it's, you know, and they all have the same name.

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's, you know, all above the love sponge.

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And, and hey, it's Gary Brian, everybody.

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They all have the same fucking names,

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but they're all promoting their station and the corporation they work for.

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Not the personality.

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So absolutely.

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Um, but I'm sure that, you know, exposing the world to this wonderful

194
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
banter on yeast radio, yeast radio.com is certainly going to help

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Mad Weinstein's personality get more exposure.

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No, this is an advertising photographer.

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you be perfect, by the way, for USA today, Mad?

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Absolutely perfect.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I love like I just couldn't sleep.

200
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This will get me an advertising job.

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Are you recording this?

202
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah.

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay.

204
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We're doing a photo shoot channel.

205
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I just want to just say one thing before Fausto but it in,

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
which is that Mike Kent stinks.

207
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No, um, what was I going to say?

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, so whatever.

209
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And no hard feelings.

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm just joking.

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I know.

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I have to tell you when I'm joking.

213
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I know.

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You take everything.

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I do not.

216
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm in the hair.

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I got to talk to your wife for a second.

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She just left to do shopping.

219
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

220
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll, I'll vouch for her.

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Go ahead.

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's up?

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Why am I talking to you?

224
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is my podcast.

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why am I talking to Adam Curry?

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Am I fucking podcast?

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because you can't get around me, Mad.

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Your wife Patricia was kind of a bitch the other day.

229
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When she was saying that she was basically berating you about this haircuts.

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now I have a whole on a second.

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think she feels horrible about the haircut actually.

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because let's just respin the the events here.

233
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
She took me over to Sam and Dave's or Tony and Guy.

234
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And normally if she'd been feeling better,

235
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
if there wasn't this time gap,

236
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
if I didn't have to go, you know,

237
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
felt's broadband off of Starbucks,

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
she would have stayed with me and then we would have been protected.

239
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because when once I got my glasses off,

240
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and once I'm sitting there with these people who are way to hit for the room,

241
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I get in trouble.

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't pay attention.

243
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I couldn't see it.

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And it was too late.

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So she feels bad.

246
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't think she was berating me.

247
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
She feels horrible.

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I feel horrible.

249
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's shitty.

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And my dear friend,

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm not going to say his name,

252
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but he used to work for Tony and Guy.

253
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And they're a very good hair salon.

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, please.

255
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm not saying that they're not.

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think that they're all superstars at Tony and Guy.

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You know, everyone wants to be the next Sam and Dave superstar,

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and they do whatever they want.

259
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You know, I, what I should do here's something I'll do.

260
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll see if I can find the picture that we showed,

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and said, here's what I wanted to look like.

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And then I'll do a picture of what it turned out as.

263
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And then you tell me if I got my money's worth.

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So don't dis them because you're not hip,

265
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and you don't know what's a hip hairstyle.

266
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So I say post the picture,

267
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
let's the audience decide,

268
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and particularly let Madge decide if this is a good haircut.

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay.

270
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Because I think your wife is just being nasty.

271
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
She has a reason to feel superior to you.

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But she is superior.

273
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But not Madge.

274
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Madge feels that we are equals.

275
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
By the way, I got a little secret for you, Madge.

276
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
My wife's a lesbian.

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No corporate radio crap.

278
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No major labels.

279
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Only the best music you've never heard on the insomnia radio podcast.

280
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How cool is that, eh?

281
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's a great sweeper.

282
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let me see.

283
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That was insomnia radio.

284
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't remember where this all came from.

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm looking through my show notes,

286
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and it's already messed up.

287
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Madge completely messed me up there.

288
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think what I wanted to say about this.

289
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
First of all, is that I got this email.

290
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, this is Jason from insomnia radio.

291
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He says that he's hooked up with,

292
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
what is this?

293
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The service, which is called radiodaddy.com.

294
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I've seen other people talk about this before.

295
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's kind of like a way you can,

296
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
a place where you can go swap and get sweepers done.

297
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I guess it's kind of like a database or something.

298
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I should check it out.

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Maybe I should go to the website and check it out.

300
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But you can get these really cool professional sweepers done.

301
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And it's kind of like on a barter basis, I guess,

302
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and this radiodaddy.com.

303
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You should check it out, because it's a good resource for podcasters.

304
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Not quite sure what you have to do in return,

305
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
if you have no voice, I don't know what you can actually contribute.

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's check it out, hold on.

307
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let's stop this insanity.

308
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's go to radiodaddy.com.

309
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you're at home, follow along with me by all means.

310
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's see if we can find out together what this is.

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay, radiodaddy.com.

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
God, it's great to have bandwidth again,

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and actually have stuff coming in when you type.

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Size being developed is a free site to allow

315
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
to change your voice overs between radio stations worldwide.

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Prime is the simple.

317
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Need a voice over recorded.

318
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You come to radiodaddy.com.

319
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Post your request and a member of Courage

320
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
of Voiceovers and MP3 upload it back to radiodaddy.

321
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You return to your site, download, blah, blah, blah.

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Absolutely free.

323
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All we ask is you do some voice overs for our members as well.

324
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Okay, interesting.

325
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think I'll donate to that.

326
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll do a couple of sweepers for some people.

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay, let me see.

328
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Got an email here.

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What was this?

330
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, this is some indie music.

331
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Shoot.

332
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm just going to leave that in the show notes.

333
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You can check that out for yourself.

334
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I already played the promo here.

335
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay, bound unto the daily download.

336
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And this is a great podcast.

337
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is a podcast about poop.

338
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And it's really great.

339
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The host of this podcast does a show from his studio.

340
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What he calls the studio, which is basically his bathroom.

341
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And he had a great guest on this morning.

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And I guess he's doing this through Wi-Fi and his laptop

343
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and through Skype.

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It was the maker of,

345
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
it was a shrink to ring.

346
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The minty fresh feeling.

347
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is a very interesting product.

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's just play a little bit of the daily downloads

349
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
so you get an idea what this podcast is about.

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This is what Christine and I listened to this morning

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
on the way to school.

352
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Crack this up.

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Gather round children.

354
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's time for the daily download with Chris Rockwell.

355
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Welcome everyone.

356
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is the daily download.

357
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And I'm your host, Chris Rockwell.

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's January 25th, 2005.

359
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Just one day from when I shoot coffee up my ass.

360
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, joy.

361
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well, we have a great guest on the show today.

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And I have a filling.

363
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's going to be a long show.

364
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We better get into the studio right now.

365
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Last night for dinner, we had hamburgers and raw spinach.

366
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hmm.

367
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Seriously, didn't the fucking blast?

368
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I know.

369
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I received some spink terrain in the middle last week.

370
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So let me just talk about this spink terrain.

371
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is an actual product.

372
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And I want you to listen to the daily download.

373
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm, in fact, I'm going to put it into that cast plaster feed

374
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that I've been talking about, which you can subscribe to.

375
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So anything I drop in there, you'll automatically get if you subscribe to that feed.

376
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So I'll drop in a daily download.

377
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Because here is a podcast actually promoting a product which can only really work in this realm.

378
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I mean, sure on the on the web as well.

379
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But this is a series of business.

380
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm going to load down on this product.

381
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So I've invited the inventor to come on the show to answer some questions.

382
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm joined now with Bruce last.

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wow, that sounded like an edit right there.

384
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There is spink terrain.

385
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Welcome to the show.

386
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Hey man, how's it going?

387
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You know, if you want to like get on the inner circle, I like to be for it to as a Thomas Edison of ass.

388
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thomas Edison.

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This whole show is filled with ass and poop references at one point.

390
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Question is, you know, so what is the target audience for the,

391
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I should find find that home outside.

392
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But right now, we have a, you can move or get in deep.

393
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You know, when I was squatting,

394
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and of course, let's see if I can find it.

395
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
195 Gs for a common.

396
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And you can.

397
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Great.

398
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Wow.

399
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, it's a big demographic.

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So, you know, here it is.

401
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There's got to be a product that could address this situation.

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And that's when I went into the lab and I developed spink terrain.

403
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Wow.

404
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think I'm one second.

405
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I need to push a little bit.

406
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
All right.

407
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This whole world.

408
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No problem.

409
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Is there a demographic for citrus?

410
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Who uses that?

411
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah.

412
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
My demographic for the product is anybody with an ass.

413
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I love it.

414
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000

416
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I put it on not org in the podcast directory.

417
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And of course, I'll post a link to this in the show notes.

418
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He's a Dutch band called Tracker.

419
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
