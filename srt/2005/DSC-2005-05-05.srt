1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Daily source code for May 5th, 2005, election day in the UK.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,800
On casting, all's live, and I'm curious.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,200
Everybody, welcome.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
It's curry at the cottage for the source code.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,400
The power of the audience is coming.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh man, it's going to be another fuzzy cast.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,600
After some major travel back from San Francisco,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,000
I am, wasier than a mother fuser.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage and Gilford in the UK.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is the Daily source code.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And the only thing that's keeping me going right now is my trusty senseo machine.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, whenever you feel lost or just playing fuzzy, there's the senseo to kick me out.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh my goodness.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Back in front of my trusted gear.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So happy about my studio set up now because, being on the road is really hard.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's like I get all kinds of calls about over modulation, under modulation,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
mono versus stereo.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Please, here I've got my fingers on the trusty knobs. I know what's going on.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So it's Thursday. It is May 5th, 2005. It's an interesting day.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Actually, called my Crystal, the PA, my assistant who lives in Geneva,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but works for me still in Amsterdam.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
She's cleaning up some of the last bits of our move away out of the Netherlands.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Calder at 10 a.m. UK time, 11 a.m. her time, and I could, you know, chance of the phone.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Actually, when she entered Skype, I could tell that she was, you know, kind of asleep.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
May 5th is a day of remembrance.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's a kind of a veteran's day in the Netherlands.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And it follows right on the heels of May 4th, where at 8 p.m. in the evening.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And this is actually a pretty interesting culture of phenomenon in the Netherlands.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
May 4th at 8 o'clock in the evening, all church bells across the country start to ring.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And there's two minutes of silence to remember the dead,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and also not just those who, well, to remember World War II.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's really it. So it's not just, you know, victims on any on forces.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And of course, the Netherlands lost millions of Jews to German concentration camps.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But it's great to see this.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What happens at 8 p.m. all television stops.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All radio stops.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So it doesn't actually stop broadcasting.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But they switch over to retail lanes, no kinds of ceremonies.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Even on the highway, people just stop pull the car over to the side and wait and, you know,

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
sit in silence for, for those two minutes.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's really a beautiful phenomenon. And so then on May 5th, everyone has the day off,

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
which isn't the case in the UK.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Today is election day, which is a pretty big elections for, for this country.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the, about the UK government and how it works.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I do enjoy very much watching the, I guess, the House of Commons.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Excuse me, which you can watch live on television, kind of like on a sea span channel here.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh man, there goes the sense that the sense they'll come and back at me.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I enjoy watching the House of Commons, because, you know, they really get into it.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And they're yelling and screaming and, you know, and, and guffering at each other.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And it's a very lively, active, governmental process.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And it's not just for, you know, for, like, the Lutenants and the secondary.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's, you know, the prime minister and the opposition.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They really lay into it. And it's, it's a fun show to watch.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It really is very entertaining.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It looks like Tony Blair will win again with the labor party, although the liberal Democrats have definitely surged ahead.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I presume that means that, you know, if they have more votes, that they will have more seats in the House of Commons.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Again, I'm not too sure.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Luckily, podcast Paul, who we've spoken about a couple times, who was really doing a lot to lead the podcast community in the UK,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
is doing an election podcast. I'll play just a little bit for you.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's doing them almost by the hour at this point. I'm, I've seen, I think this is number 12.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So he is giving updates. Here's a bit of what it sounds like.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Welcome to UK election podcast number 12.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's not Paul, by the way.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's it.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And you let in a conservative MP.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not the thing that you're protesting about that we change.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What we change is the strength of the economy, the health, the hardworking families,

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
the investment in schools and hospitals and the communities of this country.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's like the House of Commons.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then we've got a big choice too on the National Health Service.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Again, they don't want to debate it.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But that's a very simple reason.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because the Conservative plan is to take over a billion pounds a year out of the National Health Service

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and use it to subsidize private sector operations.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There's the thing that I like the way these elections are played out.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And unfortunately, being in the States for the past almost 12, was it five days.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I missed out on a lot of the late minute.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I guess all the tours that all the candidates were doing and all the talking they were doing.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The talk shows and the TN, the TV appearances.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But they really get down to the details of notice.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If you look at the newspapers today as well, there's really a very finite definition of what's going

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
to happen to the tax dollars, to the tax pounds, tax money.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They're still arranging debate here about the UK joining the euro.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There's a referendum on the way for the European Constitution.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And there's really a lot of good details that are discussed.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Very eloquently, I'd say.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It seems to me like it's a little less fuzzy.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
At least in the explanation, God knows if what they're saying is true or not.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I certainly don't.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But it does feel like they get into a lot more detail.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I wish that we'd gotten podcasting in front of Tony Blair.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think he would have been able to do some really good ones.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Which, oh yeah, that reminds me a long time ago.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's see.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Was it almost coming up on a year and a half or two years now?

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I helped the leader of the Dutch Socialist Party.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Young Marais started a weblog.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And it really took, he was on my radio show when I was doing the Morning Show in Holland.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And he came on.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was really just a down to earth guy.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I enjoyed talking to him very much.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I'm not afraid of the socialist moniker.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
In fact, many of his party, I think, are looking at him kind of with a sliag,

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and I'm like, what's he up to?

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But he's got a great personality.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I think, you need that first of all to lead any country.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And the socialist party is by no means leading the Netherlands.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But they are climbing in popularity.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so he started his weblog and just kept on going and it's been posting every single day.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He post pictures.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And I've subscribed to him in my aggregator.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I use net news wire for my Mac for, for most of my aggregator stuff,

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
which also understands enclosures, so it understands podcasts as well.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And in my iTunes, popped his first enclosure.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So I even though it's a radio commercial, it is technically a podcast.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Will do.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The Netherlands, in one European superstar,

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
but in the whole country, it wants to say,

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
if you want to stay in the Netherlands.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Say, then, if you don't take the European side of it.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you know more?

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you know what?

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We have SP points in L.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And we have SP points in L.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So the Netherlands also is holding a referendum about the European Constitution.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I mean, just think about that for a second.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
How wacky this is that Europe is creating a constitution of all these member states,

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
all these member countries.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And I can't agree on the constitution, which, of course,

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
having seen the, what was that movie with Nicolas Cage,

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
national treasure, the declaration of the constitution?

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Is that what they were stealing?

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think they were stealing the constitution.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Was also written by Renegades, if I understand the history as explained in the movie.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And in this case, it seems like the Renegades are against the constitution.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like this is some form of, you know, big corporate roll-up,

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
which is the way it feels to me.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And there was been so little information about, you know, what's in the cond,

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't think anyone really knows what's in the constitution.

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You know, just try and find it, you know,

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Google European Constitution and try and find the document.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I was probably show up somewhere as a PDF,

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and then if you can understand the language,

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
well, then you're definitely smarter than I am.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So the referendum will be held on June 1.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And there was a podcast by the socialist leader of the socialist party

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and the Netherlands saying, you know, vote against the constitution.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If the Netherlands votes against the constitution,

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm not sure if they can do it by themselves,

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but then and probably one other member state at the calling of the states,

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but they're really countries could throw this constitution.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It could set back, you know, this effort that's been ongoing for 25 years

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to roll up Europe into one United States of Europe.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It could really stunt that.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So it'll be interesting to track and, you know,

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
where are the podcasts coming from Brussels?

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That would be nice if we could have them.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, travels came back from San Francisco.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And unfortunately, I couldn't get on a virgin flight,

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
you know, I really enjoy flying with virgin airlines.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They have great miles program as well.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And they have this, like middle class,

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
so you have economy, then you have premier economy,

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
which gives you a little bit more room, which is just that,

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
that little bit extra for, you know, my six foot four body frame,

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
which is just, I can't sleep in those chairs regardless,

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
because they don't recline enough.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And if they do recline them, my shin bones hit against the seed in front,

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
but it also gives you the advantage of being able to show up a little bit later

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
because you do get a separate check-in line.

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You know, just some of the, some of the things that I like about first class

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
without these $7,000 first class ticket,

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
which I just really used to pay for.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So I had to go on British Airways, and I showed up at SFO San Francisco International Airport

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
with about an hour and 15 minutes before departure time.

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So in time enough, and I, you know, made a reservation through the phone,

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't even do it online, because I just didn't have access to web browser

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
wanting to make the reservations.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So I show up, you know, it's a one way ticket, because I had a one way come and over.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
One way ticket, it's an e-ticket.

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So immediately I got the much feared quadruple S stamp on my board,

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
which means in the minute you go through, go through security,

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
TSA, and go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
secondary, secondary over here, folks.

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Which means you get a secondary check right off the bat

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
without even, you know, going off to the metal detector.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I got completely, completely and thoroughly searched.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Almost enjoyable, actually.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
My bag was ripped to shreds, and I, you know, my travel bag now

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
was just filled with wires, and connectors, and MP3 players,

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and recorders, and of course adapters, and currency adapters for,

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
for power adapters for different, different currencies,

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
since U.S. has won ten, and see, like the rest of the world,

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
almost is 220 volts, multiple laptops, and so,

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you know, they went through everything meticulously, you know,

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
examining each item and opening it up and extracting the batteries,

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and, you know, rubbing it down for traces of explosives,

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and, you know, it took about 20 minutes.

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Now, this type of security, by the way, I'm not against.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I, it's, what I hate is when they just kind of like,

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
you know, run your shit through it, and, you know,

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and this is like they're pretending to look for something

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
just to make everyone feel safe, that there's some kind of security check.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is a real check, and I do appreciate that.

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And, indeed, there it came, out came the lighter.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry, sorry, you aware this is illegal contraband,

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and we have to confiscate this.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, yeah, enjoy a little bit lighter, okay.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I guess that can be deemed extremely dangerous,

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and I was wondering, I don't smoke cigarettes,

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
so I was wondering if you actually buy a pack of cigarettes

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
after security, do they offer you matches with that?

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Or, can you not even buy a lighter or matches at all in the airport?

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I should figure that out and see if that's true or not,

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but, so that was kind of fun.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And of course, then they also broke the lock off of my bag,

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
which I checked in.

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They do put a nice little wire strap around it,

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
so that, you know, I guess they, it's kind of closed

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
then after that, but, you know,

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
maybe if they'd said, you know, please leave it open or something,

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
or, you know, I don't know, just the fact that someone

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
breaks open the lock on your bag,

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and then rummages through it is, you know,

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I understand the security issue of it,

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and of course, that also had the triple S stamp, so I get it.

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But, you know, why don't you just tell me to keep it unlocked?

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So, the lock was kind of nice, actually, you know,

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and I like it because I've had shit stolen out of my suitcase

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
many, many times, even with a lock on it, you know,

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
it's just, I don't know, you feel a little bit violated.

232
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I understand, in this case, why I was a security risk,

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
but still, there should be perhaps a better way to do it.

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay, what should we talk about?

235
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I have so many promos lined up, I've got, you know,

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
let's get into a mashup right now,

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
because I feel like a good music.

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Walking talking vertical man.

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
One, two, three.

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
One, two, three.

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
One, two, three.

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
One, two, three.

346
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
One, two, three.

347
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
One, two, three.

348
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
One, two, three.

349
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
One, two, three.

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
One, two, three.

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
One, two, three.

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
One, two, three.

353
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
One, two, three.

354
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
One, two, three.

355
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
One, two, three.

356
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
One, two, three.

357
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
One, two, three, two.

358
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Two, three.

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
One, two, three.

360
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
One, two, three.

361
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
One, two, three.

362
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
One, sixteen.

363
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:33,500
I'm looking for some more mashups. I know they're out there, but please send them off to me.

364
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:40,780
I'm giving you some email addresses as well to send off your promos and your potsafe music and mashups as well.

365
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,500
We'll talk about that in a second but first. The reason why we're in San Francisco, I want to tell you about that.

366
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:54,000
As you know, Ron and I were in New York, one was because we wanted to be together to do the strategy cast and really appreciate all the comments.

367
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:04,500
We have hundreds of comments on the weblog on the show notes for at the dailysourcecode.com and probably hundreds more private emails that people sent.

368
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Not everyone wants to post their comments or their ideas publicly, many because they have ideas that maybe they don't want to put in the public space just yet.

369
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:24,500
That's really great. I like it, you know, positive and negative because this is why we do this out in the open and let you know what we're doing as openly as as is humanly possible.

370
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,500
I said we were coming out with dam announcements and where we are, we're announcing stuff and let you know what our strategy is.

371
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:42,500
It's very helpful to see this type of feedback mainly because the one thing I like about it is to see how poorly sometimes communication works.

372
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Even though we thought we might have explained some things really well, people pick up on words sentences.

373
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:56,500
It's very much like the game of telephone we've played as we were kids, you know, you say one thing to someone and then maybe by the if someone didn't hear the whole two hours which is completely conceivable.

374
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,500
They'll read something and then, you know, before you know it, there's a big confusion about what is what.

375
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:10,500
So really enjoy all the comments and all the weblogged postings and all the podcasters news group postings.

376
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,500
It's pretty interesting to read. I actually just say very interesting to read.

377
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:30,500
And we were in New York to do the strategy cast and also we had a couple of follow up meetings with Madison Avenue companies and brands and, you know, talking about advertising and enabling advertising for any podcaster that is interested in taking advertising.

378
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Just so you understand, if you're not interested, that's fine. You know, I don't think there's any way that myself or wrong bloom or podshow or anybody for that reason can really hijack podcasting.

379
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I mean, there's anybody can continue to podcast and do that with the tools are out there and available.

380
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I think that just about everyone could set up a complete podcast infrastructure for themselves for almost almost no money.

381
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I think that you still have to have some cash for hosting.

382
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,500
And this is this is really something that has become very apparent to me.

383
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Having been using with great graciousness, by the way, from apples dot mac team.

384
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Having been using their infrastructure to distribute the daily source code for the strategy cast, moved over to our own server.

385
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Now we have two 100 megabit connections unlimited, unlimited as they call it. So I think that's without the servers.

386
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,500
That's about six or seven thousand dollars a month.

387
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:42,500
And even that wasn't, well, that certainly wasn't enough if you could tell it completely swamped the pipes when everyone just wanted to hit that and just download it.

388
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Now, of course, you know, I could have done a shorter show.

389
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,500
We could have compressed it at half the bit rate and you all these technological solutions which certainly would have worked.

390
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,500
But, you know, I don't think anyone's have to be a rocket scientist to be able to do this.

391
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:08,500
So it's clear that, you know, in order to have the right infrastructure to really make podcasting fly the way we've seen web logging take off.

392
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
You know, it'll take some some form of money.

393
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:20,500
And we can certainly all, you know, have our little web host, you know, which have all different types of setups, you know,

394
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Libs in, for instance, interesting bunch of guys.

395
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,500
And they have a model where you pay for keeping your older shows online.

396
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:36,500
But what happens when you get the equivalent of a slash dot effect on a web log, you get that in podcasting.

397
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
I've actually had this happen a couple of times where I've pointed to someone's podcast.

398
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:48,500
And, you know, the first 15 or 20 people were able to get it to get to it immediately and then either that hosts.

399
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Pipe was swamped or the account that the person had, you know, if you get like a $20 web hosting account, you get maybe two or three gigabytes in transfer information per month.

400
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,500
And that filled up and then whoops, you know, there you go, it gets cut off and there's no more downloads.

401
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,500
What are we going to do about stuff like that? And I think that's actually a very serious concern.

402
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,500
And if you have a show that you want me to promo and by the way, you know, just keep the promo is coming.

403
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Because what I do is I just started the bottom and I play the promo as one by one as they come in, you know, it's still pretty manageable for me.

404
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,500
You know, if you got to consider that I'm going to send people your way and you have to be kind of prepared for it.

405
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:40,500
So as we saw in the web logging world with weblog systems, there were certainly in the beginning there were lots of free services.

406
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:52,500
And as you hopefully know, a part of our strategy is to give away free podcast tools and hosting to anyone who's interested for free, which of course on our end will be advertiser supported.

407
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Not within the context of your show, there's no, you know, there will be no constraints, you can do whatever you want.

408
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,500
If you don't want the advertising, then, you know, there'll be a monthly fee. That's I think that's pretty reasonable.

409
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Because what I don't want to happen is I don't want, you know, like a repeat of what we saw with weblogs.com, where at a certain point either.

410
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Well, I think it does eventually come down to money.

411
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Either it's more people that have to manage the process or more money for bandwidth.

412
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,500
You know, somewhere someone's got to give, particularly because we're not talking text files anymore, right?

413
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
We're really talking about some serious bandwidth.

414
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:36,500
A bit torrent, still a great option. I know that most of the clients, the iPoddark programs out there, understand bit torrent.

415
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Personally, I haven't really had the time or the understanding of how to set up a bit torrent system that would work for me.

416
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,500
And then, you know, then comes another problem. This goes back to more than half a year ago.

417
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
We're talking about alternate downloads.

418
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:06,500
And I remember Dave and I were working on an alternate spec for an alternate spec or name space for RSS to enable a separate download feed, which would be bit torrent only.

419
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
And I'm not quite sure that how the well that's going to work yet.

420
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,500
So I'm definitely looking for help if someone is out there creating a bit torrent podcast solution. Let me know.

421
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Because I would like to try it. And I think that the daily source code is probably an excellent program to try that shit.

422
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Because if it breaks first of all, you know, I won't cry.

423
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:29,500
We'll get it up somehow. And secondly, there's, you know, it pushes a lot of bandwidth.

424
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,500
So if you've got a system that I can try and something set up, let's give it a shot.

425
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,500
By the way, my pipe is down again here in the UK, my four megabit pipe.

426
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:49,500
And that guy, man, is easy in it, guys. And it's like, you know, it's a local loop unbundled, which means it's not really easy net is providing the service.

427
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,500
And it's coming through a clear open line that British telecom provides. And now that they say that lines down, British telecom says the line is fine.

428
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
You know, it's like, it drives me nuts.

429
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Luckily, I have the backup, but it's still, it's only a one megabit download.

430
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,500
And the amount of subscriptions I have, it's been just cranking away all morning long here.

431
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:22,500
So back to the infrastructure part. So we're in New York, and we started getting calls from, well, first of all, also a part of the New York trip was the serious agreement, which, as I said, it came together pretty quickly.

432
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Only a couple weeks after talking about the concept of having a place where, and this is really important that we talk about this.

433
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:37,500
The pod show on serious, which will be on, was it the talk channel, I think channel 148.

434
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,500
It's, it's a marketing channel for podcast.

435
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:54,500
That is really the entire benefit, I think, to anyone who wants to promote their podcast to an audience of moving towards 2 million subscribers now on serious.

436
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:05,500
I think subscribers who probably may not have an MP3 player, and also a market that is going to grow exponentially because of all the deals that are put in place by

437
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:14,500
the satellite radio manufacturers to actually have car radio systems that are pre-installed as you buy your car.

438
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,500
The first thing they'll have is it'll have a satellite radio receiver.

439
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,500
There are a couple of brands, most notably I think Volvo and BMW that also have iPod connectors.

440
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Of course, that's missing out on an entire market of other MP3 players that won't connect in that fashion.

441
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:39,500
But also, serious, really is filling a void of people who probably might not even have been exposed to podcasting.

442
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:47,500
So the pod show on serious is, and this is where some confusion came up, is going to be, as I said, like a daily source code, not the daily source code.

443
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:59,500
I'm not going to give up my baby, I'm going to do continue to do the source code, perhaps if I think a show is worthy enough or good enough, I'll put the daily source code on that pod show.

444
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:10,500
But it's really going to be a place where you can submit your podcast, your promo, your pod safe music, your mashups, and I'll just be putting as much into those four hours daily as possible.

445
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:23,500
And I think it should be enough looking at the ocean of content that we're seeing already and the number of people that are submitting stuff to my personal Gmail account and for the daily source code.

446
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
And I think we'll be able to fill up those four hours.

447
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,500
And as it grows, I hope to take over an entire channel and maybe even have the interfaces a little bit more open.

448
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Right now, of course, I'm going to have to be some sort of filter to, well, to format it, put it all in place.

449
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,500
When I say format it, that means, you know, to have a format in mind of how it would start off.

450
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Like the source code, you know, we have some promos, then we play a mashup, then we have some pod safe music.

451
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
But it's going to be completely open.

452
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:03,500
I want anyone to submit if you're interested and you want to promote it and put your, you know, your URL in there, talk about your podcast feed.

453
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Say whatever you want, you know, if it's, if you just want your whole show submitted, please do that.

454
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,500
I'm going to be playing as much as possible within those four hours.

455
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,500
So it's not going to replace the daily source code, you know, won't be like the source code is only available there.

456
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
And it also doesn't make a lot of sense.

457
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:28,500
And I'll think to put those full, those full four hour daily programs onto into a podcast.

458
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
That kind of defeats the purpose.

459
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,500
And it's also not for people who are, I think, are already receiving podcasts.

460
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,500
This is for people who aren't aware of what podcasts are.

461
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Or for people who just want to have, in some way, to sample it.

462
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Which may be, you know, a broader universe to sample podcasts than the daily source code or other shows that are out there that, you know, perhaps promote other podcasts.

463
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,500
So I see kind of as an extension of what, what, what we have at iPod.org.

464
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,500
That's where I get my, my information, your new podcast for, for this show.

465
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Maybe we'll look at what's top rated podcast, Ali, which is, as voted on by, by the community.

466
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
And we have nothing to do with that.

467
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,500
So, and then, of course, I'll, I get as many, I collect the things as possible.

468
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,500
But if you don't send it to me, obviously, I can't play it.

469
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,500
So is it broadcasting? Of course it's broadcasting. Is it bad? I don't know.

470
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:27,500
I, I think that it's a great way to promote your, your podcast.

471
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Okay, so it starts Friday the 13th, of course, of date, I chose.

472
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:43,500
And if you want to submit your show or your promo, either one is fine, send it to submit at podshow.com.

473
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,500
If you, if you're banned and you want your music exposed send that to podsafe at podshow.com.

474
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,500
If you got a mashup, which is something I'm looking for, send it to mashup at podshow.com.

475
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:02,500
That's actually pretty cool because mashups, although, you know, we kind of get away with it doing it playing them here on the source code.

476
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Obviously, there's some RIA issues there, and this will be a great way to get mashups out there.

477
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,500
And people will be able to listen to them since serious, does have their, ask at BMI agreements in place.

478
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:22,500
And they already pay for that. So you'll be able to, I will be able to put mashups on the podshow and serious.

479
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:30,500
And again, if we can fill up the four hours, then I'm sure I can convince them over there to give us a whole channel and open it up a little bit more.

480
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,500
As the, you know, the original concept here is as an openpodcast.org type model.

481
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:42,500
And what I will be doing is publishing show notes for every single show.

482
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Actually, I got to talk to Andrew Grummet, who runs gigadile.net.

483
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,500
He sent me an email. I'm just parsing through the 3000 on red and emails right now.

484
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,500
He sent me an email about setting something up with gigadile so that you can actually get back to the core,

485
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,500
show themself. So if you, if you hear something that you like, and hopefully if you already know what podcasting is,

486
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:12,500
then you'll be able to go to the podshow show notes, pick up the XML feed and subscribe to the show that you like.

487
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Also, we're going to have feedback. Again, it's, it's like a really big podcast, only it's not for your MP3 player.

488
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:29,500
It's, it's for serious satellite radio. That's going to be the, the receiver part.

489
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Just so you know, anything goes. There is no restrictions. We have full, and I mean full creative control.

490
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:43,500
That was, you know, like a big thing that I would prepare to fight for, but wasn't an issue,

491
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:50,500
because they don't have to adhere much like podcast. They don't have to adhere at all to the FCC regulations.

492
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:58,500
They do have to adhere to, that's interesting, the digital millennium copyright act, which gives them one distinct disadvantage.

493
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Well, I mean, we have a, a bigger disadvantage in, in podcasts where you can't really play any RIA music.

494
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:14,500
But on the satellite stations, you can do and say whatever you want, what you can't do is you can't play two songs by the same artist back to back,

495
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,500
because they consider it a digital transmission, therefore it falls under the digital copyright millennium act.

496
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:27,500
So what you don't hear on the satellite stations unless they've gotten, you know, specific approval from the record companies.

497
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:36,500
And you won't hear like an hour long special of one artist, because it's a two songs or you can't do more than two songs back to back.

498
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,500
It's some crazy ass law that even the record companies don't really understand.

499
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:55,500
So, you know, nothing else is going to change on the source code. I wish I had, you know, less flying time in recent weeks to just do more, you know, more daily source code, because it's not really a daily source code.

500
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,500
I get in about an average of three a week. I'm trying to get it back to five and actually the next week will be pretty easy.

501
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:07,500
I'm staying put Patricia now is going to go away. She's going to stay with her sister for a week and do some family stuff.

502
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:18,500
So it'll be just Christina and I and Christina and I have some ideas for we're going to do a podcast. Maybe get some of the tune. She's been listening to and do some together. So that should be fun.

503
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,500
All right, a couple of promos. Let me get off to the first one I have lined up here for you.

504
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Who's who's flash?

505
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,500
The thing you're hearing in the background is some role that it is door counts material.

506
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,500
The door counts are proud to present the first ever open source MP3.

507
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,500
And if you get a sound editing program on your computer, you can enter our contest.

508
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Just go to www.dorktown.com and see details.

509
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,500
The door counts, innovating and masturbating.

510
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Dorktowns find Dutch podcasts. It's interesting that podcasting has been so slow to take off on the Netherlands.

511
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Seeing is that a lot of the development done on iPoders was done by Dutch people by Dutch developers.

512
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,500
So this, specifically the lemon team, a couple of Dutch guys there.

513
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:11,500
So what is it? Doppler and nimic all Dutch developed programs and still very slow to pick up there.

514
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
So back to San Francisco for a second.

515
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,500
So taking all of that into consideration about, well, I really miss that whole part when it's straight into serious.

516
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Taking into consideration that it is going to take some significant infrastructure.

517
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,500
If we really want to get all these people creating podcasts and we want to bring in the millions of listeners.

518
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,500
And that, of course, partially will be through initiatives like the pod show on serious.

519
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,500
That's a promotional vehicle. That's going to bring people,

520
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:48,500
I guess I'm going to bring listeners in. In some ways, I've got to kind of go back to half year ago or maybe even nine months ago and re-explain how it works.

521
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:55,500
It's not just for iPods. You'd be amazed that not everybody knows what podcasting is.

522
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Really don't particularly in the United States. I'd say that there's quite a void of knowledge.

523
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,500
I'm going to see it on the email feedback when what articles people might pick up on.

524
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Because that's really how people are discovering podcasting now is through mainstream media.

525
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,500
So if Dawn and Drew do an interview or if I do an interview or if there's another great article or even if there's a bad article,

526
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:26,500
doesn't matter. The interest gets sparked up and people start to go to the net and figure out what's going on.

527
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,500
So this infrastructure is going to take money. That's for sure.

528
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,500
And Silicon Valley who really, if anyone's late coming into podcasting,

529
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
I think it's the West Coast in Silicon Valley.

530
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Because this is not so much about the technology.

531
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,500
I think we've really done a great job over the years with RSS and the enclosure element,

532
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,500
building iPodders and building up just to know what we have now.

533
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:57,500
I think at iPod.org it's more than five and a half thousand podcasts are being tracked right now.

534
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,500
And I don't know how many podcasts Ali has, but probably an equal amount.

535
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,500
It should be an equal amount if not even more.

536
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Is this infrastructure?

537
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,500
And we really stay the way Ron and I from, you know,

538
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,500
from ever really being interested in going the VC route venture capitalists who,

539
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
you know, I just don't know anything about it.

540
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,500
I've never taken any money from venture capitalists.

541
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,500
For our, for our plan to succeed when it comes to the media side and it comes to the creative side.

542
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,500
I don't think there's not really a lot of money that's needed.

543
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
You know, we have our pod squad now.

544
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,500
We have Donna Drew and Rock and Roll Geek and Steve Gilmore and Madge Weinstein and

545
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Skinny on Sports and CC Chapman is working with us with Chris Rockwell to build the pod save music network.

546
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
There's not, except for the pod save music network.

547
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I don't think you need a lot of infrastructure to just get that going and

548
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,500
build the interfaces for allowing any podcaster.

549
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:05,500
If interested to participate in media dollars, which I just think is an easy way to do it.

550
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,500
You know, I'm hearing all kinds of podcasts who have sponsors and advertisers already and they've picked them up locally,

551
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
which is perfectly valid and great.

552
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,500
In fact, I was listening to Caribbean free radio this morning and heard they now have a pretty serious sponsor.

553
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Sponsoring their show.

554
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,500
So maybe you're not interested in ad sales, maybe not good at it.

555
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
So it'll be a pretty effective way for you to check in.

556
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:38,500
And if you want, you don't have to deal with the sponsors at all and you can just get free podcast set up free hosting.

557
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,500
And if you are interested in searching, finding for a sponsor that fits your show.

558
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Because that's an important part.

559
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:55,500
You know, I don't think it makes any sense to have a sponsor that isn't really sponsoring anything or advertising any product of service that doesn't directly deal with what you're talking about.

560
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,500
You know, unless you think all of your listeners drink Coke, then of course Coca-Cola would be a great one.

561
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,500
But it's really about matching up the right advertisers with the right shows.

562
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,500
And that's a two way street is what the advertisers working for looking for and it's what the podcasters looking for.

563
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,500
So that's a pretty open system, but it is going to take that infrastructure.

564
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:23,500
And we were getting calls from from like big firms have only heard of and read of like, you know,

565
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Clienter Perkins and Mayfield and Sequoia Capital.

566
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,500
And as you know, I was planning on returning Saturday.

567
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Didn't even have enough underwear to go for a couple more days.

568
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
So Ron and I said, you know, let's go out and let's meet with these people.

569
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Let's see what they're thinking about.

570
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:44,500
See what their thoughts are on what what the West Coast of, you know what the technology industry is looking at.

571
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,500
I have to say pretty clueless, they had really don't know much about it.

572
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,500
So it was a very educational visit.

573
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,500
But it was kind of cool to, you know, to sit with some Silicon Valley legends.

574
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I guess what is pretty typical out in the valley is if you have a successful business, then, you know,

575
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,500
and after you sell it, I think there were a lot of, well, not just, you know,

576
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:13,500
one or two guys who came from the dot com era like Mark Kwame, who was works now at

577
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
He's at, I'm going to fuck this up.

578
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I don't know if he did Sequoia, I think Sequoia Capital.

579
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,500
He was actually one of our peers when we had think new ideas.

580
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,500
He had CKS, which later merged with US web.

581
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Not quite sure what happened to the company, but so he's now a venture capitalist.

582
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
And it was fun.

583
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,500
We actually ever met, but it was fun kind of going through the old stories of, you know,

584
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,500
seven to 10 years ago when we were all building a big interactive marketing and services companies.

585
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:51,500
But also Ray Lane, who was the, I think, the president and CEO of Oracle.

586
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Wow, what an interesting guy that is.

587
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,500
He's been through a lot in the tech industry and cut these guys that were like smart.

588
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,500
They definitely know what kind of, you know, what you need to make something tick when

589
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,500
you're talking about infrastructure and, and, and really.

590
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Yeah, everything, but I'd say, well, actually, they have a lot of media experience too.

591
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,500
And then there's another guy we were in another meeting.

592
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
And it was just two people.

593
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,500
And we're, you know, we're, we're talking about what podcasting is.

594
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,500
And I think I mentioned this before, but Kaikya, who, who, who did the Adams family.

595
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,500
She, basically, produced and edited the Adams family for us.

596
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Our reality show, she did a 10 minute video, which we actually did that like a couple months ago.

597
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Just kind of explained the podcasting concept.

598
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,500
And, you know, in your, your typical marketing means, you know, so you kind of understand what,

599
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,500
where it came from, what it's doing, you know, some examples.

600
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,500
And I think it's, a lot more fun to, to talk about such an exciting medium is audio,

601
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
and do it, you know, with a video presentation.

602
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Audio was kind of tough if you're in a room with people.

603
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
And you all just have to kind of sit there and listen.

604
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,500
So we, we created video versions of everything.

605
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,500
And that worked really, really well in explaining our concepts.

606
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:17,500
And to, like, a woman and a gentleman, someone, a little older, a little bit older gentleman,

607
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
which means older than I am.

608
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,500
And, and we were talking, and he had some really good questions.

609
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
And, and he said, you know, I've, he had a French accent.

610
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,500
He's like, I have the lemon, and I like it very much.

611
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
And he was talking about some podcasts that he listened to.

612
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,500
And then I, I glanced on this business card.

613
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,500
And then I finally hit me, then I recognized the name.

614
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,500
Jean Louis Gasse, he's the, I think he was a chief technology officer of Apple.

615
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,500
And he also had B. Remember B, the BOS.

616
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,500
And so, you know, once I figured out who he was, then I could kind of drive the conversation to have

617
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
him tell me some stuff.

618
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,500
And at the end of that when I was like, I said, you know, you know, we've got to do this.

619
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
We have to do this meeting again, Jean Louis.

620
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
We have to do this as a podcast.

621
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
And he will.

622
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,500
So if I get, if I get out to the West Coast again, then it will be, I'll definitely be talking

623
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
to some of these people and just getting their stories.

624
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Because man, these guys have some interesting backgrounds.

625
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Was another guy who, who totally understood what we were talking about was,

626
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,500
oh man, I'm bogging all these names.

627
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Hold on a second.

628
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,500
I mean, grandma.

629
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,500
I like eight million business cards, which I never do anything with.

630
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Uh, who was it?

631
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,500
Oh, yeah, I remember from, it was Randy Commissar.

632
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
He's at Clienter Perkins.

633
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,500
And he's, he's an East Coast guy, really.

634
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,500
It was funny because, uh, and we're running, I took a bathroom break before we left.

635
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,500
And, uh, and the income is this guy, you know, he's got a, he's got a head phone on.

636
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
He's talking on the phone while he's taking a leak in the mirror.

637
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,500
And Ron and I looked at each other and went like, this guy's got to be from the East Coast.

638
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
He came to the West Coast.

639
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Uh, and Randy, I think was involved in Tevo in the early days.

640
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Uh, so he totally understands a lot of, uh, a lot of the concepts,

641
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,500
because I, you know, podcasting is in, in effect in some ways.

642
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Uh, the technology of it is very much like a Tevo.

643
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Even though, uh, we're, you know, the content pool is not limited to a number of television stations.

644
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,500
It's just completely and utterly and lovely wide open.

645
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,500
Like, for a Boston, it's the M show.

646
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Well, it's not really live, but it is 10 minutes of business talking entertainment from Boston.

647
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,500
We'll talk about some of the latest business topics, a quick talk section.

648
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,500
And over in an entertainment, we'll talk about DVDs and books that you should check out to feed your business brain.

649
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
And don't worry, it's worth safe.

650
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
And only 10 minutes.

651
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Check us out at DM show.com www.THEMSHOW.com.

652

653
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Hi Adam.

654
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
This is Andrew Seymour.

655
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,500
At Ed Tech Musician, the number one education podcast at podcast hour.

656
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
Are you the police?

657
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
No, ma'am.

658
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
We're musicians.

659
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
We're musicians.

660
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,500
We're musicians.

661
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
We're musicians.

662
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
We're musicians.

663
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,500
We're musicians.

664
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Ed Tech Musician is not just a podcast about educational technology,

665
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,500
not just about music technology,

666
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:20,500
but about having a great time making music, listening to music, and teaching music.

667
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500

Like 43 minutes already.

677
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,500
I'm going to go a little bit long today.

678
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Here's something really cute.

679
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
I heard on the Paris Helping Podcast.

680
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,500
Back to Paris Helping Podcast,

681
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,500
downtown the House of Wax.

682
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,500
It's Monday, May 2nd.

683
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
I'm still in New York doing publicity for my movie.

684
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,500
By the way, I'll make former days to little events.

685
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
I also want to thank Adam Curry and Don and Drew.

686
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,500
Yeah, boy.

687
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
I'm supporting my podcast.

688
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,500
You guys are rock.

689
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Yeah.

690
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Okay, Paris.

691
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Thank you, first of all.

692
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,500
It's funny because my daughter heard that.

693
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
She's like, oh, that's really cool.

694
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,500
But Mads Weinstein's a little bit hurt, Paris.

695
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,500
I wanted to talk about you guessed it.

696
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Paris Hilton, my sponsor, my first sponsor.

697
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Now, Paris, I appreciate the sponsorship that you've given

698
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
to codshow.com.

699
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,500
I think it's wonderful.

700
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,500
I love your podcast and the whole concept of a podcast is wonderful.

701
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,500
And it's your pioneering.

702
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,500
Oh, yeah.

703
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
I have kissed your ass up fucking much, please.

704
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
I need to do anything more.

705
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Now, you've hurt my feelings, Paris.

706
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,500
No, not because you didn't let me go downtown

707
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,500
and then go downtown, if you know what I mean.

708
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,500
But rather because on your most recent podcast,

709
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
five, two, I didn't hear today's yet.

710
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
If you did it already, I don't know.

711
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
You said I just want to say thanks to Adam.

712
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
Kerry and John and Drew.

713
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,500
You guys rock or something like some equally eloquent

714
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
expression that you made, Paris.

715
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,500
But you didn't say anything about Mads Weinstein.

716
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
No, I don't know what's going on.

717
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
I don't know if you don't listen to my show,

718
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
but certainly somebody from your round to round,

719
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,500
must listen to it.

720
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
So you're listening to Paris.

721
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,500
If you're her friend, is it so much to ask to say,

722
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,500
thanks to everybody including Mads Weinstein,

723
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
who once seemed my pussy up in one letter.

724
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,500
You can say that you can be mean.

725
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,500
It's okay.

726
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,500
I think, you know, you shouldn't go for that hunter.

727
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
No, I'm sorry, the Rod Stewart's wife.

728
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:46,500
You should go for Mads Weinstein as your new real-life body.

729
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Now, now you'd be on the cutting edge.

730
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Okay, so Mads has a,

731
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,500
I think she has a genuine beef there, Paris.

732
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
I guess there's going to be four more episodes

733
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,500
until the movie opens.

734
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
House of waxpodcast.com.

735
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:07,500
It's a, I still wish there would be more.

736
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,500
I do like listening to the, to the mob scene.

737
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
That actually has even frightened me.

738
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
You know, I've been not really mob,

739
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
but you know, there's, I've had lots of people asking,

740
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,500
you know, for autographs and stuff and in certain situations,

741
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,500
certainly back in the MTV days.

742
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
But wow, I mean, what kind of life is that, man?

743
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,500
You walk out the door and it's just fucking crazy.

744
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,500
And the photographers, man, those are obnoxious guys, huh?

745
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,500
They just yell and yell and yell and make you want to turn

746
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
and look this way and that way and it's just, you know,

747
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,500
it seems like, yeah, it seems pretty heavy.

748
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
So I like that part of the podcast.

749
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,500
I'd still like to hear some more private moments.

750
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Maybe when you're really just, you know, shooting the bowl

751
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,500
and not, you know, it seems like some of it,

752
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,500
you know, is kind of like prescripted or prethought out.

753
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,500
It's, uh, it's fun, fun listening to it.

754
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
It's definitely in my subscription list.

755
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,500
And, uh, man, I'm not going to get to everything I wanted to get to.

756
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
Let me play another podsafe music tune,

757
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
because this is, uh, CC has been feed to me.

758
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,500
CC Chapman from Axon-Hashpodcast has been feeding me with some great tunes.

759
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
I like this one.

760
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Say what you will.

761
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:30,500
And maybe this is better than the play.

762
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Oh, there we go, round again.

763
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,500
So I don't taste the way it's just looking better.

764
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,500
If you bother me that I never would just go.

765
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,500
It's a final trip, but I never got all the first.

766
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,500
I don't want to keep you like I said it's looking better.

767
00:47:54,500 --> 00:48:00,500
I don't want to keep you when I'm never with you way.

768
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

769
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

770
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Oh, there we go, round again.

771
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

772
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

773
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

774
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

775
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

776
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

777
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:02,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

778
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:08,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

779
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,500
I don't want to keep you when I'm never with you way.

780
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:29,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

781
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:36,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

782
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

783
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

784
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

785
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:09,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

786
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

787
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

788
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

789
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Say what you will, but maybe this is better than the play.

790
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,720
Nobody get me better

791
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,260
No

792
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,460
Too might have survived

793
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,760
For

794
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,120
Cheese

795
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,640
For

796
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,400
We have livna

797
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,660
Yeah And this is Chaz with rockfitting.com

798
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,660
We're launching 15 minutes of fame.

799
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:01,660
Andy Warhol always said everyone has 15 minutes of fame.

800
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,660
So I'm thinking why not do a podcast about it and give everyone that opportunity

801
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,660
to tell their story their 15 minutes of fame that they've had.

802
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,660
I mean, come on Adam, you have met every major entertainer on this planet.

803
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,660
I mean, you are probably stockful of great stories.

804
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,660
But what about those Joe's and James out there who don't have an outlet like you?

805
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,660
I'm going to give them a voice, a podcast.

806
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,660
So if you're an entertainer with a new release, hey, we'll give you 15 minutes of fame.

807
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,660
Or if you're just an everyday person with a great story to tell,

808
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,660
we're interested in hearing what you have to say.

809
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,660
Please submit story ideas and MP3 files to podcast at rocketfifteen.com.

810
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:48,660
And hey Adam, I think that you should submit as well because you know I'm sure there's a few things you haven't told us about the old MTV days.

811
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,660
Oh, one final thing.

812
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,660
I'm going to be podcasting at the Kentucky Derby.

813
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,660
Now that's going to be held on Saturday, May 7.

814
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:00,660
And I'll be given all access to this event, which means I'm going to be in the in-build brigades.

815
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,660
Not everybody takes a close-up.

816
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,660
All the way up to me and airs roll where the celebs hang out.

817
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,660
So check it out.

818
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:12,660
The podcast is at rocketfifteen.com where everyone has 15 minutes of fame.

819
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,660
That's kind of interesting.

820
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,660
I didn't know people took the clothes off at the Kentucky Derby.

821
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,660
Hello, this is Ron Stevens, the host of the AwareTech podcast series.

822
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,660
AwareTech is different.

823
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,660
I promise you than any other series of podcasts you will ever tune into.

824
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,660
AwareTech is diverse.

825
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:35,660
But the common theme tying together all of the podcasts is that they are concerned with our future as a culture and as a society.

826
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:46,660
My background is in science and technology and I am particularly interested in how the rapid developments in these fields are going to affect our society and our culture in the near and the far future.

827
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,660
And I address this from many different angles.

828
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:59,660
So different podcasts will take on scientific or technological areas, but also economic, social, even political and religious impacts.

829
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,660
It's the diversity that will surprise you the most about AwareTech.

830
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:11,660
I take on scientific and technological topics, but I also take on economic and even political and even religious topics.

831
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:22,660
And somehow I keep a common theme of how the future will unfold with respect to all of the changes that are occurring so dynamically in so many different fields at this point in time.

832
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,660
And I certainly am also concerned with what can we do about the future and how can we make it better.

833
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:40,660
Not just sitting back and analyzing, but what can we individually and collectively do that might impact the future for ourselves and our children in a better way to come out with a better outcome.

834
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:48,660
So stop by and check it out. I think you'll find it interesting. I think you'll find it educational and hopefully go find it very entertaining.

835
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:54,660
Okay, what was I thinking letting the announcer guy host to show this time? Now I'll have to do the announcing.

836
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,660
Let me see, 3, 2, 1. It's time for the hit test.

837
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,660
Okay, let's go.

838
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,660
I can do this.

839
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,660
3, 2, 1.

840
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,660
It's time for the hit test.

841
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,660
With an announcer guy Kevin.

842
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,660
Hello, Adam.

843
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,660
I captured your guy Kevin here.

844
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,660
All right.

845
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,660
Here are my birthday.

846
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:18,660
Young was nice enough to let me come out from behind the mic so to speak and pick out the songs for today's hit test.

847
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,660
There was no way I could narrow down my all-time favorites to just 3.

848
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:28,660
So instead, I decided to pick out 3 songs that sort of embodied the image of my high school days.

849
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,660
Okay.

850
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,660
Okay. You know how it works.

851
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,660
3 intros.

852
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,660
3 answers.

853
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,660
So here we go.

854
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,660
Here's intro number one.

855
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,660
Oh, yeah.

856
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,660
I wonder what is high school days comprised of.

857
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,660
Okay. I think you're hearing this one.

858
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,660
You probably went to school a little bit before me, Kevin.

859
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,660
An announcer guy Kevin.

860
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,660
That's, um, of course.

861
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,660
No static FM.

862
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,660
No static at all.

863
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,660
Classic.

864
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,660
Classic.

865
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,660
This is intro number two.

866
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,660
Uh, let's do the brothers.

867
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,660
I know it's a dubies.

868
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,660
I don't remember the five notes.

869
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,660
To be brothers.

870
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:13,660
And finally, here's intro number three.

871
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:18,660
Uh, you know, uh,

872
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,660
uh, you know, uh,

873
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,660
that's coming to me.

874
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,660
So I'm the same thing.

875
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,660
That's coming to me.

876
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,660
So I'm the same period.

877
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,660
Well, of course, it's his high school day.

878
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,660
I don't know. I give up on that.

879
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,660
It's kind of all the same genre.

880
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,660
Uh, so what do we have first?

881
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,660
Steely Dan.

882
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,660
Okay. Adam.

883
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,660
Time's up.

884
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,660
Let's see how well you did.

885
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,660
Okay.

886
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,660
Here's answer number one.

887
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:51,660
The title track from the movie that every self-respecting radio DJ has a copy of.

888
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,660
And from the awesome WLP soundtrack of the same name.

889
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,660
There's Steely Dan giving us no static at all with FM.

890
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,660
Yeah.

891
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,660
Yeah.

892
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,660
I've been ready.

893
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,660
It was very much like podcasting.

894
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,660
At least content wise in those days.

895
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,660
Not like the distribution, of course, of podcast.

896
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,660
It was wacky, man. Anything we got.

897
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,660
By the way, mainstream media said,

898
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,660
FM will never work. No one cares.

899
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,660
No static at all.

900
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,660
No static at all.

901
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,660
No static at all.

902
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,660
That was answer number one.

903
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,660
Steely Dan with FM.

904
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,660
Here's answer number two.

905
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:48,660
Uh, I can hear the booming now from the Jensen speakers on the back deck of my 68 Chevy

906
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,660
Impala.

907
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,660
This is the Dooby Brothers with Dippenden on you.

908
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,660
I'm gonna guess the title.

909
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,660
I know what.

910
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,660
Would not have guessed the title, Kevin.

911
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,660
Answer number two.

912
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,660
Today's special announced or guy addition of the hit test.

913
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,660
The Dooby Brothers.

914
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,660
Now answer number three.

915
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,660
It was tough.

916
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,660
Serving is a small homage if you're tripped into New York and a song that definitely

917
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,660
here marks my high school era.

918
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,660
Here's the boss singing about Broadway lights on the dice.

919
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,660
This is Joe Joe.

920
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,660
This should know now.

921
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,660
Joe Joe.

922
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,660
This should know now.

923
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,660
Joe Joe Dingo.

924
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,660
Penny lights.

925
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,660
Where games did he have to go?

926
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,660
Joe Joe Dingo's Broadway lights.

927
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,660
That's your life.

928
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,660
You have known him.

929
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
Cool.

930
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,660
Great song.

931
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:25,660
Boss Caves with a third and final answer wrapping up this special edition of the hit

932
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,660
to a nice email out.

933
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,660
Well, Adam, if I did a good job, not only are you three for three, but you were saying,

934
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,660
Yeah.

935
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,660
Yeah.

936
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,660
I hope you like them.

937
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,660
Yeah.

938
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,660
Well, let me come out from behind the mic on some special occasion in the future.

939
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,660
And I'll pick out some more 70s and early 80s for you.

940
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,660
As always, feedback is welcome at hittest at gmail.com

941
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:51,660
and more information about the hittest can be found by going to youngpollip.nl or dot com.

942
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:55,660
That's J.A. and P.O. L.E.T. dot nl or dot com.

943
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,660
Thanks for letting me do this.

944
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:02,660
Yon, I had a lot of fun. Adam, Yon, I'll be back next time for another edition of the hit

945
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,660
to ride on.

946
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,660
Bye for now.

947
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,660
Thank you very much, Kevin.

948
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,660
An ounce of guy and of course, youngpollip.

949
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,660
And of course, the hittest will, I love the hittest.

950
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,660
Now, I'm going to continue to do that on the daily source code.

951
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,660
Maybe Kevin, you create your own version of a hittest.

952
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,660
And there's something we can throw up on the serious as well.

953
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,660
And it just hit me, you know, now I know how to do the serious stuff.

954
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:30,660
Yeah, so if you are podcasting and you want your podcast promoted,

955
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,660
it'll go.

956
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,660
So if you submit it, it'll go out on the serious show.

957
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,660
But then, of course, well, I think the cool thing will be as a place we can go see

958
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,660
what was played, what was promoted, will have the XML,

959
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:48,660
you know, the subscribe links on, we'll put up a special website for, I guess.

960
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,660
And maybe, and I'll have to talk to Andrew Grumman about this.

961
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,660
And you know, with GigaDial.net, maybe the cool way to do it is you can,

962
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:00,660
if you want, you could reassemble all of those different shows that we promoted,

963
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,660
and you could subscribe to them.

964
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,660
So maybe that's like an OPML file that you can, you know, just drop in and

965
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,660
automatically subscribe to whatever was heard.

966
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,660
Of course, it would be important that you could unsubscribe from

967
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,660
shows just as easily.

968
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:16,660
I haven't found that functionality in any, I potter aggregator yet any,

969
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,660
any way to, you know, I guess you can, you can drop in a whole list of,

970
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,660
of podcast feeds, but I'd like the capability to, you know,

971
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,660
take them out as well as a group.

972
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,660
So let's say that would just be a great way to sample new stuff.

973
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,660
Because, you know, I'm already at, what am I like now?

974
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,660
Like we're at an hour now on today's show.

975
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:37,660
And I'm just catching up on potting on promos and stuff I want to play.

976
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:41,660
So, um, kind of think about how to do that.

977
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,660
Okay, time for a call with Andrew.

978
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,660
That's for sure.

979
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:48,660
Podcasting.

980
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,660
What is the real potential for this new media?

981
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,660
What impact will it have on independent musicians?

982
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,660
These questions nobody can answer.

983
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,660
Okay, maybe Adam Curry can answer.

984
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,660
But I thought, what a better way to join the party than to produce

985
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,660
my own little podcast.

986
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,660
I loved it.

987
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,660
CC radio.

988
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:11,660
And it's a bi-weekly podcast, audio journal, slash radio show.

989
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,660
Hello, my name's Chris Conley and I live in Boston, which is home to one of the

990
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,660
northeast greatest live music scenes.

991
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:21,660
So join me bi-weekly for my podcast about the music scene here for my

992
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,660
perspective.

993
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,660
I'm also a music educator and I'll have interviews with other musicians,

994
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,660
teachers, and interesting perspectives on the music business.

995
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,660
In this crazy little thing we call bug gusting.

996
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,660
Just subscribe to my podcast.

997
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,660
Please feed your podcast and client my feed feeds dot feed burner dot com slash

998
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,660
CC radio.

999
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:51,660
I rock radio playing the best Oklahoma has to offer from the independent music scene.

1000
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:56,660
I rock radio rock radio rock in the planes.

1001
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,660
I rock radio dot com.

1002
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,660
I are okay.

1003
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,660
Radio dot com.

1004
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,660
Everybody.

1005
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,660
I rock.

1006
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,660
Okay.

1007
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,660
Stuff heating up in the music scene for podcasting.

1008
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,660
We're starting to get it together.

1009
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,660
I'm really digging that.

1010
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,660
That's probably going to be if anything's going to be really successful in podcasting

1011
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:21,660
that has just been waiting for podcasting to happen.

1012
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,660
I really believe it's going to be the concept of pod save music and how we can create

1013
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:32,660
our own music industry completely routing around whatever is out there.

1014
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,660
We're going to help in that.

1015
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,660
You better believe it.

1016
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:38,660
The pod save music network is going to be hopefully a big part of that.

1017
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:46,660
A place where podcasters can go and easily build a community or tap into an existing community

1018
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:52,660
actually to find out what's being played and really become the intermediary.

1019
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:59,660
It's like the old days when Kevin the announcer guy, I guess those days of FM radio,

1020
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:03,660
that's when you'd have a disjockey would literally say, I'd love this song.

1021
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,660
I'd love this band.

1022
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,660
I've saw these guys play.

1023
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,660
I spoke to them.

1024
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,660
I hook up with them.

1025
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,660
Listen to this.

1026
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,660
This is good stuff.

1027
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:13,660
That's what we've been missing on the internet with independent music.

1028
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,660
To sample music is a pain right.

1029
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,660
Or it was a pain until I think podcasters came along.

1030
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,660
Now we have all these great places to go to.

1031
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,660
So see it in music podcasting.

1032
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:27,660
And just, I've been listening to accident hash for a long time.

1033
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,660
I just heard two other podcasts.

1034
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,660
We can pick up some great pod save music and just enjoy it.

1035
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,660
And then what we want to facilitate is a place where you can easily go and buy it.

1036
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:45,660
And that will be a great place for artists to make some money off of all this.

1037
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,660
It does help if you can pay rent and you like performing your art.

1038
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:54,660
And if you want to support the pod safe music, then you can support each individual artist.

1039
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,660
You can find out about it by listening to different types of shows.

1040
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,660
Because, well, like CC likes to send me a lot of rock stuff.

1041
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,660
There's also, oh, man.

1042
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,660
I think let me see if I have it here.

1043
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,660
It's the, here it is.

1044
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,660
This is Monday, May 2nd, 2005.

1045
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,660
And you're listening to speechless.

1046
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:12,660
This is cool.

1047
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:16,660
This is instrumental pod safe music.

1048
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,660
Actually, I think I played a promo for the show before.

1049
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:22,660
But, you know, instrumental music comes in all forms.

1050
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:26,660
A lot of techno, but also classical, you name it.

1051
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,660
It's there.

1052
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,660
This is listening to a little piece of this speech.

1053
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,660
This is a show number six.

1054
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,660
Welcome to speechless.

1055
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,660
This is a show about new instrumental music.

1056
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,660
And you are listening to episode number six.

1057
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,660
My name is Luke Stark.

1058
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,660
I will be your host this evening.

1059
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:42,660
And this is a special episode for two reasons.

1060
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,660
This is the Luke is in the dog house with the little woman episode.

1061
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,660
Oh, I thought Michael Butler had a trademark on the head into what that means later in the show.

1062
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,660
All right.

1063
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,660
The speechless podcast.

1064
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,660
You want to listen to instrumental pod safe music.

1065
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:01,660
And of course, links to all of these shows will be in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

1066
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:02,660
Hi.

1067
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,660
Hello.

1068
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,660
This is Lily.

1069
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,660
The world's youngest podcast dude.

1070
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,660
I'm three.

1071
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,660
Spending you a message.

1072
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:12,660
I'm a cry.

1073
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,660
It's over three presents.com.

1074
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,660
Watch your strength to the people.

1075
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,660
Press the nation's capital.

1076
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,660
Ottawa.

1077
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,660
Ontario.

1078
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,660
Canada.

1079
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,660
I didn't call the queen.

1080
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,660
Don't just make it up.

1081
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,660
Hi dad.

1082
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,660
This is the daily source code.

1083
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,660
And ask me to send you this message.

1084
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,660
I'm glad it's spring again.

1085
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,660
I hope you have a good day at spring.

1086
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,660
Oh, okay.

1087
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,660
And did you know Adam's in pain?

1088
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:47,660
Yeah.

1089
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:48,660
We don't have spring over here.

1090
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,660
Well, and can we help you?

1091
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,660
Give us a listen.

1092
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,660
H-O-Y-Street.com.

1093
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,660
He.

1094
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,660
He found podcasting.

1095
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,660
Rock R-B.

1096
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,660
Good guy.

1097
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,660
Very, very cute.

1098
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,660
Little G.

1099
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,660
Excellent.

1100
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,660
Excellent.

1101
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,660
Okay.

1102
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,660
So that's going to wrap it up for today.

1103
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,660
What I didn't get to.

1104
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,660
But what I suggest you check out is podcast brothers.

1105
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,660
They have interesting podcasts talking about.

1106
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,660
I'm not.

1107
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,660
I don't know if they're involved in the Disney 50th celebration podcast or not.

1108
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:27,660
I think Michael Gohagan is either producing it or put the deal together.

1109
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,660
I went.

1110
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,660
I subscribe to it.

1111
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:32,660
And there is a podcast feed, which of course put in the show notes.

1112
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,660
But there were no files in it as of yet.

1113
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,660
So I guess that's still forthcoming.

1114
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,660
Interesting to see what's happening with that.

1115
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,660
And if you listen to the podcast brothers podcast.

1116
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:50,660
You hear that, you know, they're going to have interviews with the executives of Disney,

1117
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,660
with cast members, with actors, all kinds of stuff.

1118
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,660
So it's pretty interesting to see that Disney went outside of their own internal,

1119
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,660
and of course they can do all kinds of stuff that they want with audio or whatever.

1120
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,660
But they went outside to go to the podcast community to ask for help to do that.

1121
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,660
So I think that's pretty exciting and totally welcome them.

1122
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:11,660
And I got a hurry up because damn it's already.

1123
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,660
It's five to one.

1124
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,660
And Christina will be home pretty soon.

1125
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,660
This is SAT week.

1126
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,660
They have sats over here in the UK as well.

1127
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:21,660
And she's been studying really, really hard and she has some questions about trigonometry.

1128
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:25,660
And despite her better judgements, he wants me to help her out.

1129
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,660
Alrighty.

1130
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:29,660
That's it for the source code.

1131
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,660
I'll be back tomorrow.

1132
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:36,660
And this weekend, Patricia and I are going to do in the podcast,

1133
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,660
except it won't be a regular Patricia pie podcast.

1134
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,660
It's going to be a podcast.

1135
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:45,660
We're going to do together in Dutch only for Dutch listeners.

1136
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,660
So we're going to hijack the source code feed for that.

1137
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,660
So be on the lookout if you're in Holland.

1138
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:56,660
And that's really because it's time for us to tell a little bit of our story.

1139
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,660
We've been in the press.

1140
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,660
Almost nonstop in the Netherlands for the past four or five years.

1141
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:07,660
Lots of it extremely negative and unfair and ugly.

1142
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:12,660
And now you're all kinds of avenues you can take and all kinds of things you can do.

1143
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,660
And you know, when people write lies about you,

1144
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,660
you can go and sue someone if you want to.

1145
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,660
But I grew up in the weblog world.

1146
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,660
So we're going to use the infrastructure rebuild.

1147
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:27,660
We're going to use our podcast to talk about the story from our side.

1148
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:32,660
And that may be a continuing ongoing story.

1149
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:36,660
I mean Patricia has a lot of history to talk about in the last five years.

1150
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:40,660
There's a lot of stuff that went on that people don't know about.

1151
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,660
So that's going to be fun.

1152
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,660
And she's really excited about it.

1153
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,660
And I like that a lot.

1154
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,660
So it's fun to work with your wife if you have to,

1155
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,660
or any, you know, your spouse if you have that possibility.

1156
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,660
And they're both into the same thing.

1157
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,660
Okay, so comments, feedback out of a curry.com,

1158
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:01,660
