1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta Shara Charley 2, 5, 8.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Brasmithor, please don't even speak in Transnithor.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There are no secrets.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Only information you don't get out of.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I'm Korean.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We don't need no sticking crazy.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm just kidding.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a battle curry.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And it is Tuesday, October 11th, 2005.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like the new opening, huh?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's right.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I need more Mexican dialect for my Transnithor's.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Welcome to the Daily Source code coming to you from Curry Cottage in the affluent Surrey

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Suburb of Gilford in the United Kingdom.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A little bit dreary today.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The jury will disregard that remark.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I just looked outside and the sun just broke through.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It was broken at 4,000 feet today.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And they're completely muddled up at 400 feet, which would have made any type of landing impossible on a non-Isles field.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can you tell that I'm getting ready for some flying tomorrow?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, yeah, I've got all my taps and my matars and I've even checked the no-tams.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So I'm ready for the trip to the Netherlands.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And you, my friends, are going with me on the road.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As always.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was thinking, what was I thinking?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It was something about the...

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, yeah, it was about the...

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, every show we start off with Delta Sierra Charlie.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And by the way, yeah, sometimes I do slip into the sheriff.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I don't know why I do that, but everyone seems to kind of get the gist.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The Delta Sierra Charlie just realized the call letters of my...

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
My sessna actually have Delta Sierra in the call sign at the end of the call sign.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Coincidence?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, I think not, my friends.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
All right, we've got Podsave Music.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Some interesting news to talk about.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The Podsave Music and Music Rights and the Unlabel.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's all coming up.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And of course, some promos.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And what would a daily source code be without the new...

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The newvo art of the mashup?

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think I might have played this one before, but it's such a kicker.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
YouTube versus Janet Jackson.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's control, bloody control.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I will separate you.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll deliver you to me.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll deliver you to my father's cell.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And there's no longer no need.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll deliver you to my father's cell.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000

The party van experience mashed up you two in Jan of Jackson's control and Sunday Bloody Sunday

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
bringing you control, bloody control on the Daily Source Code.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Mashed up for your convenience.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Two songs at once have price.

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The glitches you heard were not another warning of a bad hard drive.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I accidentally hit I keep a timer running and I have it.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It was a chimoo timer or something which of course is impossible to remember whenever you

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
want to start it up.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I didn't hit it right when I was, I have to basically act like Nixon's secretary here when I

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
start the show.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hit audio hijack pro on one computer and hit the timer and the sound effects.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The starting of the car.

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I got to start those at the same time.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then I have to get my hands on the buttons for that and that effect.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Then I realized in that song that they used the exact same sample in the

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Jan of Jackson that car crashes I have here in the Yamaha.

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Lovely.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So anyway I was opening and closing Shimoo timer and I gave a little glitch in the audio.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Not that that should happen but oh someone who was it.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I got a great email.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh man I got a couple of emails.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I wanted to catch up on today.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't have it here off hand.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll find out who sent it to me.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
On OSX which of course has a Unix base.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You can nice the process.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Meaning you can allocate more processor time to it.

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And that really does work.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I just haven't set up.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's kind of stupid because you can't kind of do it once it's already running.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You have to start the application.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So I'd start megaseg from the command line and you can tell.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is the beauty of Unix really.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
As you can say, hey, give this application more

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
processor time than the other apps which seems to work very well.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Paul Nichols sent me an email.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This morning he says it's struck me out.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I've been listening to you for one year today.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is that right? I'm pretty sure it is.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He says it feels so much longer than a year.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I honestly cannot remember listening.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well it says something else.

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can not remember.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Listen for.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think he's low life before podcasting.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There we go.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It permeates every conversation and waking thought of mine.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I have to say I absolutely love it.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Remember you talking about the brand new iPod or an iPod element?

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, that was a while ago, wasn't it?

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He says I'm embarrassed to say that it took me two whole months to work out how to record an MP3 file

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and how to work out RSS.

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank goodness things are getting easier for the newbies.

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Podcast Paul, right?

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Cheers for getting me involved in such a fantastic hobby.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Mate? Well my pleasure.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Absolutely.

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I just love it when emails like that come in.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's so cool the community that we're building here.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And I think it was in San Francisco.

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I was talking about free Wi-Fi or using other persons Wi-Fi and that there should be a way

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that when you see a node sitting there and lots of people have them just unprotected.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And then plenty of people have them password secured.

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I feel there should be some kind of middle ground there so that you can say,

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hey, you know it's all right if you want to use this bandwidth,

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but you should be able to set parameters like, you know,

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
log in here with a free password and you can use it for an hour

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
or contact me at this email address if you need more.

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And we'll talk about it, right?

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's kind of the social way of doing it.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I said it's social.

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So Bob Scott sent me an email.

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He said, you know, this is actually pretty simple.

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There is a way in the middle.

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He says you're idea about allowing controlled access to personal Wi-Fi.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Access point is an interesting one.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think we're pretty easy to alter the firmware of a wireless router to initially redirect

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
anyone logging in without a web key as a password to an internal web page.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And that could log there a Mac address.

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And that is nothing to do with Apple computers, but with your Ethernet card,

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you know, how you communicate with a network, even if it's wireless.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And make them jump through any whoops you like by entering an email address, et cetera, et cetera.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You could limit these guests by bandwidth, by time, connection type,

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
only HTTP, for example, anything else you want to do.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So it's a great concept when you think about it.

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This is very much like when you log into a public access point like TMobile or

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
or here in the UK BT Open or anywhere, you know, it usually throws up a web page

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and you have to enter your payment details, which by the way could also be included in this.

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What's cool about it, and this is something I didn't know, is that linksis

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
have released the source code for their routers under the GPL,

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the general public license, or the GNU public license.

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So any has all kinds of links and stuff, and there's a source forage project.

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But we could actually make this.

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And wouldn't it be cool if linksis would then include it in their, in their Wi-Fi routers?

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I guess, you know, it's GPL code, so I wouldn't they, why wouldn't they put it in there?

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Think about the possibilities. You just have a separate set up panel,

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
which will be a part of the default when you install the router.

240
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And you can put in stuff like, yeah, anyone can connect to my, to my computer,

241
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
but they have to, you know, maybe an email is sent to me to know that someone is doing it,

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and they have to enter their email address, so I can contact them,

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and we could limit it to, you know, to two hours or an hour or whatever.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's a really, really good idea.

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And interesting, very, very interesting.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And particularly if we can make the kind of standardized and rolled out across all those linksis routers.

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Ah, another social project in the making.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hello.

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000

And now, back to Adam Curry and the Delhi source code.

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hot show.

Content that will make you squeeze the dog and burp your mother.

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The following program is closed captioned for the thinking impaired.

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hey there, pod fans.

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000

Josa.

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Another big community taking advantage of podcasting.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is funny.

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's funny I was talking to a reporter from the Guardian this morning.

277
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's a big newspaper here in the United Kingdom.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I guess the story now that this comes in waves and it comes in waves really.

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Where the press gets interested in talking about pod casting and they have a different

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
angle on it each time.

281
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I've seen from what was published just the other day in the Wall Street Journal front page,

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
actually, as well as from the questioning of this reporter from the Guardian Bobby.

283
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That the angle now is, hey, big business is getting into pod casting because they see

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that there's lots of opportunity and listeners in that world.

285
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's our world.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's me and you.

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Everyone else who's tuned in and listening to pod cast and making pod cast and pod safe music

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and having a good time.

289
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's kind of the angle.

290
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Actually, the reporters are asking the right questions.

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They want to know, is can they walk into the space?

292
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do they know what they're doing?

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Is this just about time shifting?

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's the one thing that I just keep coming back to.

295
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Look, we didn't create the demand for this insatiable addiction that people have to pod cast.

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That demand was created by an industry that kept competition day by owning frequencies,

297
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
towers, and infrastructure.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What is the name of that Danny K movie?

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Gosh, damn, I've referred to this many times.

300
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's a Danny K movie.

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I remember very distinctly, and Danny K is the head of a research group and they're sitting

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
in a university or like a cloister almost.

303
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
For years, writing the definitive book on music.

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
While they're in there writing about Chopin and Bavaldi and Bach and Handel and

305
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you name it, jazz is happening outside.

306
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And the music scene just changed overnight almost, of course, it took a couple of years.

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And then Danny K, of course, has this big euphoric moment where he discovers that music hasn't

308
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
changed and they're writing the most outdated book that they could possibly think of.

309
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Although history, of course, is important.

310
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't want to downplay that.

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But what is the name of that movie?

312
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Someone helped me out there.

313
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's exactly what's happening right now.

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And it's not like this doesn't happen.

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's not like, also, music and the music business and the broadcast business.

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It never stays the same.

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's always continually evolving.

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
A broadcasting based on technology improvements.

319
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And music is cultural.

320
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You know, it shifts.

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We can't shift very quickly with the way mainstream media operates because of basically.

322
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They just don't have enough channels to get underground currents that are running

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
along and pick them up and and propel them into something.

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And this is very much like, although I wasn't there, Patricia completely agrees with

325
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
this analogy.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's like the 60s.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
When FM radio was just starting and there was no business model for it.

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It was just wackos playing an hour of songs in the key of G.

329
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And coffee shops and record stores and, you know, back alley clubs.

330
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And we were exchanging music that way and we were building.

331
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You know, we were building our own.

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We weren't.

333
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But my parents were Patricia was a man.

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You know, being a part of a new sound, new type of music.

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You know, and that happens consistently throughout, throughout history.

336
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's what we're seeing here.

337
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I'm excited to be a part of that.

338
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah, I'm Gary.

339
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah.

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is Shubi Shubi.

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, Shubi.

342
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I'm a spell check from Potacular.

343
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Have you ever thought of a magazine that would cater to people interested in podcasting as well as podcasters?

344
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Well, me and Shubi think it'd be a great idea for a nice little publication.

345
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Considering that's one of our most favorite things to do is read magazines and podcast.

346
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Basically, what a magazine would do is, since it would be a public magazine, it would get the word out to more people

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
in a way that iTunes or anything else wouldn't be able to do.

348
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like, I'll also buy showcasing equipment because that's what they want things.

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I really don't know what equipment is available.

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And then I'd do a pint like how to better my podcast with better equipment.

351
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And also, just, you know, like with ads, like even publishers podcasts even more with, like, a text ad and a magazine.

352
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes.

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, what do you think of this idea?

354
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Can you please, like, tell us, because we think it's an ingenious idea.

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We're awfully interested.

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Hopefully, hopefully interested.

357
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Spell check.

358
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Thanks, Adam.

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah.

360
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, first of all, of course, I think you live in America.

361
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You can do anything you want.

362
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You can get your magazine started.

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There's enough people who will be interested in that.

364
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm sure.

365
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You also might, yeah, I'm kind of torn because you might want to consider becoming a destination on the internet.

366
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If you guys think you can drive a community, then maybe the community will spawn a magazine

367
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
that someone will want to have because, you know, there's always a value to print.

368
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's not like the web is taken over everything.

369
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I buy all kinds of magazines.

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I buy flying magazines.

371
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I buy handheld computer magazines, you know, and for a number of reason.

372
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And where I usually buy it when I'm getting on a long haul flight.

373
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's just a great format.

374
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's portable.

375
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I love it.

376
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I love the format of print.

377
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's still nice.

378
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Too bad it's gotten too expensive to, to really do a lot with it.

379
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Good luck guys.

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Let me know how it goes.

381
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll certainly support you.

382
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Dan Turnbow.

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Turnbow.

384
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It says, hey, Adam, love the show.

385
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Been a loyal listener from day one and enjoy podcast so much.

386
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It has changed my life.

387
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
First off, if I'm a self listening to very little radio anymore, what I do is fill a one gig.

388
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
SD card.

389
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Fill it up.

390
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Listen with my Dell accent while out and about.

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Plus, I take all my favorite shows to work with me.

392
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You guys and girls really help pass the time while on the job with me.

393
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I just love the idea of listening to content on my schedule.

394
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And not one of the media wants me to.

395
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But Adam, the biggest change in my life that has come from podcasting is when you turn

396
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
beyond to what Don and Drew show said about smoking.

397
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
May not see much to many people, but that was the final push I needed to give up cigarettes.

398
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Today I'm happy to say that I've not had a single cigarette since February.

399
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And I really do believe I got them kicked.

400
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If I don't miss them at all here lately.

401
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So I'm closing.

402
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Just want to thank you for changing my life and many others out there.

403
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, you of course, you did that yourself.

404
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And I don't think you changed your life.

405
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You saved your life, Dan.

406
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And I wish I had this sound bit.

407
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I didn't have enough time to go through all the archives with February.

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You know, it's just that, of course, unfortunately is not a simple thing to do with audio files yet.

409
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But I think it was Don saying that because I, you know, Don and I had talked about smoking.

410
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And she said, oh, I just can't, I can't smoke a cigarette because it was something like smoking a cigarette

411
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
just like sucking on the cock of the man and the man being the man.

412
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You know, she says there's so many chemicals in there to get you hooked, keep you hooked.

413
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And it did it for me, man.

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll tell you, at least for tobacco products.

415
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's for sure.

416
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This is the daily source code.

417
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Always full of interesting bits, contributions from other people.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
My good friend, Jan Poled is here.

419
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Once again, with the hit test for today.

420
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
All you casting with Adam Curry.

421
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I suppose you think you never knew the music.

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What do you, yeah?

423
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Oh, yeah.

424
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The hit test.

425
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Young Poled.

426
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
With your Poled.

427
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Hey Adam, this is a new hit test.

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I've been a bit busy and it's going to stay the way for a while.

429
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So I don't know when the next hit test will be.

430
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Fortunately, I found some time to do this right now.

431
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So here we go.

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This is number one.

433
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's so Whitney Houston.

434
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's Whitney Houston.

435
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's Whitney Houston.

436
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's number two.

437
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah, I got that one.

438
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Depression mode.

439
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
People are people.

440
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Good songs.

441
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Good songs, Jan.

442
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Dig it.

443
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And number three.

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's true.

445
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's level 42.

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Hot water.

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So I got to remember the Whitney Houston one that I'm good.

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And time's up.

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And these are the answers.

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I know.

451
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
How will I know?

452
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Number one is from 86.

453
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's Whitney Houston.

454
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is how will I know.

455
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

456
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I know.

457
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He's a daughter.

458
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He's a daughter.

459
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He's a daughter.

460
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Man, she was great back then.

461
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
How will I know?

462
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Just trust your feeling.

463
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
How will I know?

464
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Who?

465
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
How will I know?

466
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If he really loves me,

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'll lay a friend with every heart beat.

468
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I want to love him ever with me.

469
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll have him you.

470
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll feel no longer.

471
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If he loves me.

472
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If he loves me.

473
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh, no.

474
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Answer number one.

475
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Whitney Houston.

476
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What has happened to her?

477
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Great music from the 80s.

478
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Answer number one.

479
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
How will I know?

480
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And this is answer number two.

481
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Depression mode.

482
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
People are people.

483
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Rather.

484
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, this was the jam back in the day.

485
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But so we'll never recover.

486
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We'll never breathe.

487
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We'll never breathe.

488
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We'll never breathe.

489
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We'll never breathe.

490
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't understand.

491
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't understand.

492
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's another man.

493
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't understand.

494
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
People are all people.

495
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So what should it be?

496
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You and I should get around.

497
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So what would it be?

498
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
People are all people.

499
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So what should it be?

500
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You and I should get around.

501
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Sun from 84.

502
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Depression Mode.

503
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
As answer number two.

504
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And this is answer number three for today's hit this.

505
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Number 64.

506
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
level 42.

507
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This is underwater.

508
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The hot water.

509
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I feel like an aging rocker.

510
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Marking on bass.

511
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Marking?

512
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
1142.

513
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Sensor number 3.

514
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And the song is titled Hot Water.

515
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This concludes hit test number 64.

516
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Again, music from the 80s.

517
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I hope you enjoyed this one Adam and I hope you did well.

518
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
As I said earlier, I don't know when the next hit test will be because I'm very busy with different kind of things.

519
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You can read all about them on yompolet.com.jnt.com.

520
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's also the website you can find info about the hit test.

521
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And hit the spotcast.

522
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And also the iTunes links to all the songs played in the hit test.

523
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
As long as they're in the database of iTunes.

524
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And feedback has always is welcome at the address hittest.gmail.com.

525
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Thank you for listening until next time.

526
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Bye-bye.

527
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you, yon.

528
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That was cool, man.

529
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I love that.

530
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Always under 90 seconds of the hits.

531
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
By the way, to the show notes maintainers of the show.

532
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I've gotten several complaints.

533
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The show notes are so complete and so good that if you take a look at the show notes before you listen to the show,

534
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
then basically the hit test is spoiled.

535
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
We have major spoiler action going on with that in the backtrack spotcast.

536
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So perhaps we'll wait a little bit or just put in a link to Yon's weblog.

537
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So that you can get the answers there with another click from the show notes.

538
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And also you can use Yon's iTunes links to purchase the songs that were used in the hit test right from the iTunes music store.

539
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Adam, well I realize that it's not politically correct to mock the afflicted.

540
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Says Darren Wall.

541
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I really, really had a good hard laugh at your screamer frustration at your power book.

542
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You may want to note though, international moment of frustration, scream day is not actually until October 12th.

543
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's tomorrow.

544
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
International moment of frustration, scream day.

545
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Oh, we'll be celebrating that tomorrow, my friends.

546
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's also the day that Apple has one more thing.

547
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
One more thing.

548
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It was funny I was talking to the reporter from the Wall Street Journal who wrote that piece about podcasting.

549
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This is really interesting. She said she had one question for me fact checking basically.

550
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Is it true the podcasting started with trade secrets with you and Dave Wein are doing that show?

551
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And I said, well, no, that's not the genealogy of it.

552
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's definitely not how it went down or how it happened or there's some important history.

553
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
There's some important technological and media history coming together that form podcasting.

554
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And I talked to everybody an hour.

555
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And then you read the Wall Street Journal piece and it says podcasting got a start when trade secrets was on.

556
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It was a podcast that was done by Adam Green Day Wein and I'm like, what the hell is that all about?

557
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But in that same conversation, she was talking about, you know, so this is going towards video.

558
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Sarah, who I spoke to with the Wall Street Journal wrote half the article.

559
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Then I said, well, what are you talking about?

560
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Well, it's the best kept secret that the jobs is announcing the video iPod on Wednesday.

561
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I said, this is the Wall Street Journal. Hello Wall Street Journal I'm talking to.

562
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He said, what, why? Why would they do that? Why would they cannibalize on the nano?

563
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
They just released. Just to give me the business reason, besides the fact that I saw the looking Steve Jobs eyes,

564
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
where when the video iPod came up in our conversation, he said,

565
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I don't understand it. He says, where's the, where's the content for it?

566
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And where's the headphone equivalent of video? He said, it's just not that.

567
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Build it into a monocle, maybe, and you got something. But, you know, I just saw it.

568
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
He doesn't planning on that, you know, and it's, I don't know.

569
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So anyway, the timing of it just makes no sense that it would be a new, a new iPod product.

570
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And I said, you know, based upon the supply lines drying up, which is all over the web.

571
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Everyone's talking about that. I think it's the new power books.

572
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You know, I think it's a new line of pro, pro machines. Oh, really?

573
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
She said, oh, just like man, Wall Street Journal. Unbelievable.

574
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
This next audio comment that came in really put a smile on my face for a number of reasons.

575
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The one reason is that here's a professional, quote, professional broadcaster, someone who's on the radio.

576
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Here in the UK, the BBC, I recognize the name and I certainly recognize the voice.

577
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Who has discovered the wonders of podcasting?

578
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And we talked about filters, you know, when you're on the broadcast license radio or television,

579
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
where whatever you say, you're running it through a certain number of filters that are essentially helping you

580
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
to not spew out nasty words. That's an easy filter because we use that all the time in life.

581
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But also political filters, what you can and cannot say that might hurt the network or other priorities that the network has.

582
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And MTV, there was a, you know, we had a lot of that, but it also wasn't live so it was much easier.

583
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And we said a lot of really rancid shit that we just got burned off.

584
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And some of those tapes exist, but our frustration level was pretty high.

585
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Listen to this, you know what I'm talking about.

586
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Hi Adam, it's Lynn Parsons here and listening to the source code last week, I heard you mention the difference between podcasting

587
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and working for a big corporation like the BBC or a big commercial radio station.

588
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And I thought I'd give you my take on it simply because I've been doing just that for the past 18 years and yet I've done nine podcasts now.

589
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And it is such fun. It's freedom with a capital F, you can play whatever you like.

590
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And although I get a lot of bands send me unsigned music, the pod safe music network is just a wealth of treasures.

591
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There's some really good music on it. And when I come to do the show, I just feel that I've had so much input and, you know,

592
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
picking the music is just such a big change because of course when you go to work for the BBC or you work for a commercial radio station,

593
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
you're given a playlist and you have to stick to it or you get a call from the boss.

594
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And this is cool. This is such a fun. And if you'd like to check the show out, it's Lynn Parsons.net.

595
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And thank you Adam because the reason I'm doing this is because I had a source code about 10 weeks ago and just fell in love with it.

596
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Lynn, now let me say a couple things about this. First of all, Lynn Parsons well known over here, great voice. I love that voice.

597
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You know, she could just read the phone book to me with that accent with that voice and I like the way your voice is recorded.

598
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I don't know where she's recording that. She's doing it at home or if she's maybe hijacking a BBC studio, but it sounds great.

599
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And there you have it. It's, you know, listen to a professional broadcaster enjoying life.

600
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You know, hey, I get to pick the music. Isn't that a fucking surprise? Fantastic, Lynn.

601
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And I just, I just love your voice. You know, we got a lot of great podcasts in the world.

602
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Thousands of fantastic ones. And once in a while you get the combination of a great show, a great entertainment or

603
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
infotainment or information, whatever you want to call, and a great voice.

604
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And Lynn is definitely one of those combinations. We welcome you, Lynn, into our world.

605
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:44,000
If you were just read the alphabet to me, then I'd, I'd open the door to the backyard and I'd have the little combo sitting out there.

606
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Say, Lynn, why don't you just start at eight and go all the way to Z.

607
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And dance with me here.

608
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:11,000
My dear, I'm crazy for you. I don't know what I should do. Stay here or follow you on home.

609
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll make you look for a kiss from your sweet tender lips.

610
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'll either have your start too long.

611
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Because I can't be around you and be with you.

612
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:50,000
If you refuse to come with me, I'll go at a long.

613
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm waiting for the day when I can finally see you.

614
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
My dear, I'm thankful for me.

615
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Because I can't be around you and be with you.

616
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:09,000
If you refuse to come with me, I'll go at a long.

617
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm waiting for the day when I can finally see you.

618
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,000
My dear, I'm thankful for me.

619
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
My dear, I'm thankful for me.

620
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Robin Stein, sweet blossom from the Pod Safe Music Network, my friend.

621
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I went to PMN as we call it Internally Pod Safe Music Network this morning.

622
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
What I usually do is I log in.

623
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I look at the most recent additions and there was a whole bunch from Robin Stein.

624
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
She just uploaded her stuff.

625
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This was the first song I hit.

626
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's a blossom.

627
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm actually looking at the Pod Safe Music Network right now.

628
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm looking at the Bio Info.

629
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Sweet blossom, there you go.

630
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
On our debut album, David Robin Stein bruised up a genre-bending blend of original jazz

631
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and bluesy folk tunes with sultry and chanting vocals.

632
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Sometimes it's playful, sometimes haunting melodies.

633
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Her songs sound as if they've...

634
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Sorry, edit that.

635
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Her songs sound as if they're straight out of a smoke-filled room in Tin Pan Alley.

636
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
She's like, oh yeah.

637
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
She's from Florida.

638
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Very, very cool.

639
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I play that for Patricia.

640
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
She's like, oh yeah.

641
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This is good.

642
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The whole thing is good.

643
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's nothing wrong with it.

644
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That's good.

645
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's totally Patricia approved.

646
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And I told her about the unlabel that we...

647
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Well, yes, I think we went further than fully considering starting this label.

648
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But we actually came up with some fantastic concepts of the unlabel.

649
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What is a record label that's not a record label?

650
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Well, we had some really interesting thoughts about that.

651
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes, they run and I were doing our daily chat.

652
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
He's getting the bagels for the office in the morning and it's afternoon here.

653
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
We always have our morning catch-up chat.

654
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And now I just love it.

655
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Love it.

656
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Love it.

657
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Great concept that we basically got to find a couple people now to help us get it up and running.

658
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Because it's yet another piece.

659
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But it's such an important piece.

660
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And it feels so right.

661
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And everyone should be able to contribute to the unlabel, you know, whether you're an artist or not.

662
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And that's, you know, that's our concept all along.

663
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And you hear how Lynn totally rocks the Podsack music network.

664
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
This is exactly what it's about.

665
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's about creating...

666
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
This is the coffee shops and the record stores and the...

667
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And the wacky FM radio of the 60s.

668
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This is what we're doing.

669
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
We're creating our own superstars through our own networks.

670
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And we can actually build that network.

671
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
In that fantastic.

672
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Let me see.

673
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Well, how much time do we have?

674
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Oh, I've got some time left.

675
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Along those lines, you owe the Tassalo.

676
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm sure I'm buttering that name.

677
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Send me an email about a new European Union copyright law.

678
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Adam is a very strange law which is being introduced in the EU countries.

679
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm not sure if it's been ratified by all the countries yet.

680
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
This is the way the EU works.

681
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But at least in Finland has done it.

682
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Finland is Scandinavia.

683
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah.

684
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
First of all, the law says that a consumer is not allowed to copy music that he or she owns for personal purposes such as backups.

685
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That's indeed that's pretty new.

686
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Not allowed to copy it even for your own personal purposes like backups.

687
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The other thing the law says which freaks me out is that it's illegal to sell or donate a book, CD, DVD, etc.

688
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Which has been purchased from outside the European Union to another person.

689
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
This makes it possible for companies to have local monopolies.

690
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
In same prices for the European markets and in Perenz that this is what American companies already do.

691
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So a couple of examples, a person who owns a record store is allowed only to sell CDs which have been published in the EU.

692
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The store may not import rare CDs from other countries such as the USA, Japan, and sell them.

693
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And this is all protectionism, dude.

694
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So that's an interesting law.

695
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
If anyone may be Paul, I think he's a lawyer.

696
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Maybe if anyone can look at that and see what the deal is.

697
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's kind of like the region codes with DVDs.

698
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Boy, is that a pain in the ass?

699
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I even once bought a blank CD.

700
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Even blank CDs are region coded.

701
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You can't play a blank CD you purchase in Europe on a regular playback machine in the US.

702
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's crazy.

703
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Telling it's crazy.

704
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It looked at the world and wondered how things got to be the way they are.

705
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
My name is Matt DeTillow and it's my mission to help you answer that question.

706
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And maybe even launch you on your own journey of discovery.

707
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
My podcast, Matt's Today in History, is a short look at the historical events of the day.

708
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You can find our feed at matstodayinhistory.com or in iTunes.

709
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We're standing on yesterday.

710
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Learn something about it with Matt's Today in History.

711
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
This is Roger Linder, Tom Castermaster at theTRconnection.com.

712
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And you're about to get familiar with Todd Redburn.

713
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
That's not bad.

714
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Oops. Take two.

715
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The Todd Caster is a podcast for fans.

716
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's an easy-to-be-band.

717
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You might hear from anybody who is a Todd Redburn fan.

718
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Who is Todd Redburn?

719
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
If you're asking that question, then this is the podcast for you.

720
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Certainly you've heard.

721
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Hello, it's me.

722
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Or maybe.

723
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Or perhaps.

724
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Then you say, oh, now I know Todd Redburn.

725
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But if that's all you know, then you don't know Todd Redburn.

726
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And you must check out this Todd Caster.

727
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Like the blues.

728
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Heavy rock.

729
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Followed by a light, pretty melon.

730
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Need a history lesson?

731
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Or maybe an English lesson.

732
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Then subscribe to the TR Connections Todd Caster.

733
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You'll find it at TRconnection.com slash Todd Caster.

734
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The Todd Caster, kind of like a little mini hit test mashup all by its own.

735
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Todd Brownman is a pretty good guy.

736
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Actually to help us move the Podship music network forward.

737
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
He controls a lot of actually I think it just wields still some weight in the music industry.

738
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:22,000
He's always seen as a leader out on the front of technology and willing to jump into the fray and give his art up for making the world better.

739
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And by the way, I think that you're pretty safe having read through all the licenses of Ask Captain BMI.

740
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I think that we're pretty safe under a fair use clause.

741
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
If you're using less than 60 seconds, I think it's actually less than 90 seconds.

742
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But, you know, please don't get into the legalities of it.

743
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Then, you know, if you're using that to make a point or to accentuate something, it's not like putting up an MP3 in the clear as they say in big media world in the clear.

744
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Or, you know, it being possible for someone to go in and edit out the song.

745
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You know, if you don't actually provide all the source material, then there's, you know, there's not much to do there.

746
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So I think you're pretty, pretty, pretty good with fair use.

747
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And it sounds like this is, I haven't actually listened to the podcast. I kind of like the promo and went along with the conversation of a, a pod save music.

748
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So the Todd cast.

749
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Interesting play on words.

750
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Okay. One more piece of pod save music, which was sent to me via email.

751
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
You know, pod save music comes in all forms, all sizes, all shapes, which includes country and blue groups.

752
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And I'm sure this was sent along the lines of the Ed Wright, Wayne Wright, Ed Wright computer computer song that I played last Sunday with Patricia.

753
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
This is Tim O'Brien.

754
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And he's got his own computer problems.

755
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What an out of memory.

756
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
When I got him, he may have found you darling.

757
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It said, you said me a file.

758
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Was it for the picture?

759
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
J fake for me.

760
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But I'm never got to see you smile.

761
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I thought of what you might be wearing.

762
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Just then I served the software from.

763
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I tried rebooting, tried compression.

764
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But it would not have been passed, you know.

765
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
My car screen mode even function.

766
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It's one big solid fuel of blue.

767
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
My hard driving itself.

768
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
My application code.

769
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And I run it out of memory for you.

770
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said

771
00:46:32,000 --> 00:47:02,000
you said you said, you said, you said said, you said, don't you say, you said, you said, don't you say, you said, you said, you said, you just said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, it said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said yes, you said, that, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you said,

772
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And I'm running out of memory for you

773
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
My cursed streetboat, even function

774
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's a wonderful field of blue

775
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
My heart driving itself, my application caught

776
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And I'm running out of memory for you

777
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
From the world of pot-safe music, my friends

778
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So what I forgot to tell you about is that Patricia liked this idea so much

779
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
She said, well, I want to sign up, I want to join

780
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I want, she can't, can I do an album? Anything I want?

781
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's an absolutely absolutely

782
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
She said, well, Ron, do the arrangements? I said, I don't know

783
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So you got to talk to the man about that

784
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
She said, I want to sign up, I want to join

785
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
She said, can I do an album? Anything I want?

786
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's an absolutely absolutely

787
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Talk to the man about that, but this is so exciting

788
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I just have not had this much fun

789
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
20 years, I'm really, really digging it

790
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
