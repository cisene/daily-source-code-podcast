Merry Christmas.

38
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,520
You need me a lot of his treat.

39
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Merry Christmas, you need a lot of this tree, love from by the way Christmas was meant to be

40
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:31,520
meant to be, so fill up your cup, raise it all up, don't shine up, now that I've found you

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,520
because you haven't finished Christmas and you've allowed us a tree, love from Christmas

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:55,520
then to your wish and then Christmas and I'll say it's one year, it's a home, forever to you for so, ever long, Merry Christmas

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, to you

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Merry Christmas at the start of a Friday's edition of the Daily Source Code, hey everybody, how are you doing?

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:31,520
There's my phone's going off already, that's PW Fenton saying, dude, we need the show for serious, the while you're already hearing it, so apparently that I'll work out, didn't let me just see what he says

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Hope everything's going well where you are, hope you've had a great week and wait, maybe I was wrong, oh wait, here we go, Friday, it's amazing, I just sent him a text message

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,520
and then he sends me on back asking what the status is, that's weird, there must be something wrong with text messaging, I gotta look into that

48
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:06,520
All right, everybody, hey, that by the way, it's from the pod save music network, if you've been logging in as a producer and wondering where the holiday category was, something was broken, Chris Rockwell

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:16,520
went ahead and fixed that, so now you can go any consort, excuse me, sort by genre and if you select holiday, up it comes, we'll have more holiday music

50
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:32,520
coming up in the source code, including subhonic music, another fix I saw which is cool is now when you're going to build your playlist, it shows up with the most recently submitted items, so that's the default now of the list view, which is also cool, it's amazing how many songs come in every single day

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:43,520
So the reason why PW is frantically texting me is because I am a little bit late on recording the show today, getting ready to the this morning after I took Christina to school

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:51,520
And oh man, does she hate going on Fridays for her first period on Fridays is math or let's say here maths maths

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:04:11,520
It's you know, just let me ask you for a second for a country that is so incredibly proud of its language and you ask any bread here, they'll say hey look you know you guys in America, you speak a different language, the original language, the English language we invented it, how come

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:26,520
That everywhere and it may be very much a London area, but I see it on television a lot and I hear people even Carol Thatcher, she you know, she may actually have a she won't have a speech impediment, I don't know, but the it always seems like the R is replaced with a W

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Oh, blah, oh, great

56
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:44,520
And sometimes the TH is also replaced by different sounds and of course it's slang, but you can't help but but recognize that the bridge definitely are mispronouncing

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,520
You know words based upon this it seems like a national thing and of course the more national it becomes the more people started adopting it

58
00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:01,520
We've seen this in the states with with acts no longer do you ask anyone something you pretty much acts can acts I can't even do it you pretty much acts in for that

59
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,520
And it's rampant anyway, that's just a side note with the hell was I talking about okay so

60
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Right took a Christina school came back because it was time before I leave for San Francisco to go and get our Christmas tree

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Which of course they don't deliver Christmas trees you got to go by when they put it in this bag, so I went to our local Saintsbury's which is you know the huge shopping market type thing super market

62
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,520
We got we got all kinds of stuff we got all kinds of stuff to make it nice and cozy for the holiday season

63
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:48,520
Of course, I've only helped participate in bringing everything here next week. Well, I'm gone Patricia and Christina probably Patricia primarily, but I'm sure Christina will help and I'm going to decorate everything then we get back it's going to be a great week

64
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:57,520
And I have worked it out now. I'm going to be able to go see my mom on the 21st so yeah things are vibrant we're going to wind down the year with a lot of good

65
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Friends family hanging out and good cheer

66
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,520
I got in a couple of emails here that I want to talk to you about today

67
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Andplifico who you've heard on the source code another

68
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Band I guess that is available through the Podsick music network for podcasters to play have their own email list and Donna from Amplifico

69
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,520
San such a a wonderful update

70
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Let me just see if I can pull a couple of pieces about this so she kind of says what is the title of this it was like podcasting it really works with podsake music

71
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,520
So here's what Donna says anyway a couple of months ago we said a few songs in email to mark hunter the tartan pod cast

72
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,520
I didn't know what a podcast was then on recommendation from a friend mark like your music played as a few times on his shows

73
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Praise their music highly on the show more importantly introduce us wisely to the ins and outs of podcasting and getting exposure

74
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:07,520
We sold numerous CDs on his recommendation. We put our music on the podcast music network and watch our tunes get played on almost 70 podcasts across the globe over coming weeks with wonderful feedback

75
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,520
We sold more CDs mark then recommended us to Adam Curry of the daily source code who played our track

76
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:22,520
The practice MP mix on his show immediately upon receiving marks email. That's right anything Mark will send me. I definitely that's a huge recommendation

77
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
See how the social network works

78
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Our site hits rocketed as did our music sales. Well, they rocketed in comparison to what we normally sold via our site. It was very exciting

79
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,020
Let's see and then it just goes on and on and on and I just want to bring that up

80
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Because that's that's really what the intent was. It's working. You know, we the only other thing we can do is help artists sell

81
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:58,520
The actual you know the actual mechanics of it on the pod sake music now work what you know we're working on Chris Rockwell working hard trying to get all kinds of shops and payment systems whatever integrated

82
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Hmm

83
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Oh, man, I'm nice cup of sensio

84
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
The trick by the way to the sensio

85
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,820
Madge because Madge says she hates it. She likes the convenience of it, but the trick is first you put in your sugar

86
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:22,020
I don't take a lot of sugar just a small spoonful then you pour some semi-skim milk in and then you put it underneath the

87
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,020
Sensio machine and then you get a nice frothy rich

88
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Coffee with a nice flavor it goes down smooth. It's not too bitter. I use the medium roast pods by the way

89
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,020
And also what's nice about it is it kind of gives you something to do while the machines warming up

90
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:45,020
You know you hit that that center button to get it rolling then you get your cup you get your sugar. You get your milk in the by time you're done with that is ready to the buttons ready to be hit

91
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
That on the side

92
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,020
See what else that I have here

93
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:59,020
I asked some questions about ask cap BMI asked if you joined ask cap or BMI could you still collect royalties from overseas?

94
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,520
There by circumventing all these and we'll talk more about another country that showed up on the radar

95
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:18,020
That has these very restrictive agreements with their local versions of ask cap BMI as it turns out and I'll just be a little repetitive here if you sign up with ask cap BMI in a number of European countries and

96
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,020
You know look at the show notes through daily source code.com or show notes that info

97
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:31,020
To see all these different countries that we've discussed apparently you're signing over your rights and that's it. You know if you want you can't give podcasts

98
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,020
There's the right to play your music. So I said can you circumvent it

99
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,020
And let's see this

100
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Why don't I have his name here shit. Oh Michael. Okay, you know Michael says that's him

101
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:54,020
I'm more familiar with how BMI works, but I assume ask cap is similar basically as a BMI writer BMI has a reciprocal agreement with most other international performing rights organizations

102
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,020
So that you get performance royalties from other countries sent to you

103
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:04,020
So there you go as a BMI publisher BMI can collect royalties for you as long as you're not affiliated with a publisher in a particular foreign country

104
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,020
So I think that is maybe a way to get around this horrible horrible

105
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Situation. In fact, let me see do I have

106
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:20,020
I thought I had to always have it in feedback. Don't wait. Okay, now we'll get to that in a second because it's actually Israel that has a similar

107
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:28,020
A similar set up for their version of ask cap BMI or wait a minute. Was it this one was I so brilliant as the schedule at here

108
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Okay, yeah, the Jacob's of the rock and roll Jew show. Oh, yeah. Well, you can add Israel to the list of countries where music oppression is happening

109
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:48,020
You got an email from a band called RBS music with a really interesting lecture that was done by their leader Nimrod love

110
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:55,020
And we'll read the little pretext that really set that up before the translation is translated into English

111
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:06,020
Think on us so the rest of the world can read it says Nimrod love a prominent Israeli musician and leader of RBS music participated in a panel on online music

112
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:12,020
Organized by the Hifah Center of law and technology which took place at the faculty of law

113
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,020
University of Hifah Israel on November 16th, 2004

114
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:25,020
Several days before the panel, the Israeli music Federation announced its intention to sue users who download music for copyright infringement

115
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:36,020
As far as August 2005, this is not happened. On the cards also is a bill promoted by the government to impose a levy on blank media and use the money to compensate artists

116
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,020
And I think that's something that's happening currently in the United States and has been for quite a while

117
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:54,020
But this is a really really good read all about the music industry and it's very specifically in Israel how it works and there's some just all kinds of really interesting things of how it goes down there

118
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Good read, take a look, I will provide the link for you for your website, the law, so be linked up on my blog

119
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:11,020
www.rockandrolljew.com where you can also find the best part safe rock and roll out of Israel. That's it. Thanks a lot

120
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:23,020
And I will see you later. Oops, I got to fix that. Why is it doing me fix that right now because it keeps doing that there must be a setting so that you can set it to playback

121
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:39,020
and fade out, no fade out, fade in, auto sag, shoot. Maybe we just do, oh, you can't do a zero. Oh, that's interesting. You can't do zero fade out on this. I must be able to. There we go. Okay, hopefully it's fixed now.

122
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:51,020
I remember that something I fixed a long time ago before my drive crashed. Update on that. The community computer Patricia set up, broken, beyond repair. I have Norton's utilities

123
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:58,020
But I can't get this titanium to boot up from from the disk because that's supposed to be your final

124
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:05,020
Savior. If you have OS 10, I'm actually saying properly now. The OS 10 disk goes in. It eats that.

125
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:16,020
But the drive smart status is verified, but it won't mount because the B tree catalog is all hose. But I can't get it to start up from the, from the Norton disk. I don't know why.

126
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:24,020
And of course, and now you've got to hold down sea and all that stuff. And I've done it before, but it just keeps spitting it out. It does not want to recognize it for some reason, which is

127
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:32,020
bummer because now what I'm going to do is tonight, I'm going to take the G5 here or the I Mac and create a new account, create

128
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:40,020
Patricia's environment on it and then install it somewhere else instead of the podcast complex so that she can use it so we can do our

129
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:49,020
email. She can do our email and our I cheat conversations between San Francisco and between the condo and the cottage. Yes.

130
00:13:49,020 --> 00:14:01,020
So I want to thank David very much for his first feedback there. I appreciate it. If if you know what's going on in your country, let us know. It seems pretty much outside the US so far, every country that's reported in

131
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:15,020
has these very stringent laws. And the only unfortunate thing is that I got to take, you know, Dave sincerity there with little grain assault based upon some of his podcast pickle postings. He's not very friendly.

132
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Let's see, pod show. They already drained AMP once. I hope they aren't coming back for more. That's not true.

133
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:32,020
Anyway, maybe we should form an unpod show company. Come on, David. Don't be like that. That's not necessary. I guess it was all in fun.

134
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,020
But it just didn't come across as very funny to me.

135
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:49,020
Oh, yeah. I've told you about hood hype, right? This is as far as I know, one of the few, it's the only one I've really found that that sounded like a real urban hip hop podcast with pod safe

136
00:14:49,020 --> 00:15:00,020
R&B urban hip hop music. Jay Mac produces and hosts the show. And I love listening to the show. This amazing, amazing music happening there.

137
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:08,020
He's working, I think, with Michael Butler now on getting some of these artists also to upload some songs to the pod safe music network for you on podcast.

138
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:15,020
But not only do I learn a lot from the stuff he plays, he learns a lot from the stuff that I'm playing. Check out this comment he sent in.

139
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Okay, for you win, you caught me, man, off guard. These guys are here.

140
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:47,020
Check, you know, it's not too often that I hear a music. So it just makes it here on the back of my next stand up and the music is a talent in the song.

141
00:15:47,020 --> 00:16:06,020
Like, man, you know what? I'm buying a copy of the CD for myself. I'm buying a copy of the CD for my brother and probably both my sister. Man, this track is just freaking nuts, man. You know.

142
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Well, I tell you where I love podcast, but I'm now more motivated than ever. When you hear music like this and people are underground, man, oh my god, you just want everybody to hear about them. This is just insane.

143
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Well, with that, I wouldn't get back to playing this track in my car. Thank you for playing it, man. I appreciate it. Don't forget to be like, you know, you know, I would have got calm.

144
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,020
Damn, I want to play this. I think it is.

145
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,020
Hey, buddy, no problem, man. You know, that's what the pod safe music network is about.

146
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:51,020
Just registers a podcast and you can play it. Here's the track he was talking about. I played it just the other day, but I don't mind playing it again. You know.

147
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,020
Hey, people, let's stop.

148
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,020
People, people are in music in your hand.

149
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:09,020
There's music playing in your head. So listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

150
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:24,020
So listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

151
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:54,020
So listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen,

152
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:24,020
listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

153
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:54,020

159
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,020
which was held in Paris, a lot of what are called the A-list bloggers met up there,

160
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,020
and there's a video and a lot of conversations circulating the internet

161
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,020
or the blogger sphere, particularly, which I guess is almost the internet these days,

162
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:46,020
about the speech that Mina Trot gave, Mina is one of the co-founders of six apart.

163
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,020
I believe that's Typad, the web logging system, and Type Key,

164
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:58,020
but it is weblog software, and Mina's topic was about civility,

165
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,020
and it was funny because I recognized a lot of what she was talking about,

166
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,020
and I knew from almost the minute she started talking,

167
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,020
that it was headed for a collision course,

168
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,020
and at a certain point she just, you know,

169
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,020
they have an iris, this is something I really don't understand.

170
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,020
I've never done this, but I've witnessed it,

171
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,020
where you have an IRC, basically a command line chat,

172
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,020
going on during a speech by someone,

173
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
and that's actually projected behind the person,

174
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
or next to him on the screens,

175
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,020
so everyone can read along with what they call the back channel,

176
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,020
and at a certain point someone came in and said something,

177
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
and I don't want to go into the details,

178
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
because I really don't know,

179
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,020
I'm not familiar with all the all sides of it,

180
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,020
but she just lashed out at some guy,

181
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,020
and then they had a public conversation.

182
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
And I was witnessing all this, and of course,

183
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,020
I've been the subject of a lot of public flame wars myself,

184
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
and I thought to myself, oh man, you know what?

185
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,020
You can't call for civility, it just doesn't work that way.

186
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,020
I think that we're building up systems here,

187
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,020
particularly online, where, you know,

188
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,020
everyone just, it's, we're almost interconnected into the brain, I guess.

189
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,020
I think that's what I'm seeing,

190
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,020
most of the time I'm seeing things that are,

191
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,020
that people might not even say out loud,

192
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,020
because it would go through so many filters in their process,

193
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
before speech was actually formed,

194
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,020
but for some reason we're communicating straight from our brain waves,

195
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,020
and all kinds of thoughts and emotions that are taking place there,

196
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,020
and it's going straight out through the finger to the keyboard,

197
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,020
and then nothing but net, and the perception of it

198
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:43,020
is equally as messed up, where we're reading tons of stuff,

199
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,020
lots of information, lots of banners and stuff

200
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,020
all over and words and things fly in,

201
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,020
and our brain immediately starts the process,

202
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
and they go the fingers again, and before you know,

203
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,020
you have full-fledged flame war.

204
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,020
I was very happy the other day to see that I'm podcast alley,

205
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,020
some of the people who were most vocal,

206
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,020
you know, all of a sudden the real discussion started

207
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,020
about Pod Show and what we're doing, and what our plans are.

208
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,020
And once I saw that, I of course immediately took advantage

209
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,020
of the opportunity to hop in and start providing some answers.

210
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,020
And although I don't think I use the word civil,

211
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
I just want to be focused, you know.

212
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,020
It's okay, bulletin boards and forums,

213
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,020
it's great to spout off and have that direct brain

214
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,020
to fingers and eyes to brain communications to loop going on,

215
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,020
but I just have to pass by most of that.

216
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
But when there's some serious conversation going on,

217
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
it really starts to work.

218
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,020
And man, I hope we can make Pod Castile

219
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,020
like the place we can have some of these conversations.

220
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,020
And you know, when people fly off the handle,

221
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,020
you know, let's, you know.

222
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,020
There you have it.

223
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Then it happens.

224
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
I'll draw it back for a little bit

225
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,020
and then maybe start to do thread, but it's clear to me

226
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,020
that I have to be able to participate somehow

227
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,020
in the online ongoing conversation,

228
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
because there's so much good information

229
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
that gets lost.

230
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,020
You know, that's the signal to noise ratio I talk about.

231
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,020
It just gets lost in there, you know.

232
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
And I won't even look at certain threads,

233
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
because I know what most of it or what I'm going to find.

234
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
And of course, then you lose some of the gem.

235
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,020
So anyway, I don't think there's any way to stop,

236
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,020
but I think it's only going to get, quote, worse.

237
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
And I don't know if it's worse.

238
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
Maybe things have to get a whole lot worse

239
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,020
until they get better.

240
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,020
But this is human nature.

241
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
I don't think that, look,

242
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,020
as humans in the, in the non-ciber world can't fucking get along,

243
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
we're bashing each other's brains

244
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
with hot lead and fucking deserts.

245
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,020
You know, this is, so it's not foreign to me

246
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,020
that this kind of thing happens online,

247
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,020
particularly when people are very protected

248
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
and there's no real bullets flying.

249
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,020
So people are passionate.

250
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,020
People believe what they think is true.

251
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,020
They are the center of their own universe, and that's okay.

252
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,020
I'm 41 now.

253
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,020
I think I'm finally starting to realize it.

254
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,020
It doesn't make it any easier to get something done,

255
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,020
but understanding it and,

256
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
you know, the pipe people say,

257
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,020
oh, don't take it personally, but I just did

258
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
with David, didn't I?

259
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
See, there you go.

260
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,020
It's fucking, it's human.

261
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,020
It's, oh, but I hate it that sometimes

262
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,020
that I'm human.

263
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,020
Right on.

264
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,020
So as I said, it's Friday.

265
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,020
Tomorrow 830, I'll be hopping on,

266
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,020
I'll be hopping on a virgin for my shuttle flight to the oil rig.

267
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Just a short week.

268
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,020
So we got a board meeting coming up.

269
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,020
We got lots of people want to meet with.

270
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,020
We have, oh, just a lot of stuff going on.

271
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,020
You know, we're figuring out how back office

272
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,020
processes work and, you know,

273
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,020
with a commercial media network,

274
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
which is going to be different from anything

275
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,020
that has ever existed for sure.

276
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,020
Yes, indeed.

277
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,020
You know, the only, I've told you this, right?

278
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,020
When I say Senseo, I figured it out.

279
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,020
Because every time you burp,

280
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
you're going to think of me,

281
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,020
but every time you see Senseo,

282
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,020
you're going to think of me.

283
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,020
It's the ultimate marketing program.

284
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,020
I encourage you to use that yourself.

285
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,020
A couple days ago,

286
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,020
we were talking about,

287
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,020
can't remember how we got to the topic of,

288
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
oh, yes, mtv.com.

289
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
That's right.

290
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,020
This existed before the World Wide Web existed.

291
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,020
I didn't know about until Mark Andrews

292
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,020
and sent me a link to the HTTP,

293
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,020
the NCSA HTTP server.

294
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,020
I think it was version 1.2 or 1.3

295
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,020
that I set up on that,

296
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,020
on that headless Sun 3 card at DJX and Virginia.

297
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
Before that, though,

298
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
and I had done it myself.

299
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
I can figure it out for sure.

300
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
Actually, I built the client,

301
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,020
you know, with like CC and all that crap.

302
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
I don't know if I could still do it,

303
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,020
you know, command line builds,

304
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
but I could figure it out.

305
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,020
So I was able to compile it and install it

306
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,020
and was using that in the University of Minnesota.

307
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,020
Came back and he said,

308
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,020
hey man, mtv.com.

309
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,020
That sounds commercial and you've got to pay

310
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
a $5,000 license.

311
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
Obviously, that wasn't workable.

312
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
And we struck a deal.

313
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,020
And I was sent to lovely link by

314
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,020
BNP shit.

315
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I wish I knew who BNP was.

316
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Let me just go to that link right now.

317
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,020
You'll get a kick out of this.

318
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,020
So that's actually at the University of Minnesota.

319
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Let me see.

320
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,020
If you follow the cookie trail,

321
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,020
the breadcrum trail home,

322
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Mark P. McAhill,

323
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,020
MCCA, H-I-L-L,

324
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
projects,

325
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,020
and then go for t on mtv.

326
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
circa 1993,

327
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
a seven second quick time of Adam Curry

328
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,020
fulfilling the terms of his commercial use of in it.

329
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
So, well, that's not entirely true,

330
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
but okay, we'll let it slide.

331
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,020
Fulfilling the terms of his commercial use of

332
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,020
internet go for server software license.

333
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Adam's license terms required him to wear.

334
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
It's funny.

335
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,020
A go for t shared on mtv.

336
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
We called this gorilla marketing since

337
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
we had zero budget for real marketing.

338
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
And it worked.

339
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Okay, yeah, I'm going to play it.

340
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Adam Curry introduction to a Nirvana song

341
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
on the mtv top 20 video count.

342
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Okay, you can't see it,

343
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
but I'll play it for it,

344
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
because it's just,

345
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
it's kind of cool.

346
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Let's see if it'll load here.

347
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Here we go.

348
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
Oh my god, look at me.

349
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
It's in the top 20 video countdown.

350
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
When we come back,

351
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
we'll have the latest video from the gentleman who puts

352
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
Seattle on the musical map.

353
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
Keep it here.

354
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:34,020
And I had a huge black and white go for t shared on.

355
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Very cool.

356
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Thank you very much for sending me that.

357
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
Excellent.

358
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,020
And the saga continues.

359
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:48,020
I had to listen to this next piece of audio feedback twice

360
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,020
to just hear all of the information that was coming out of it.

361
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,020
This is that the podcast or Roger Smalls

362
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
who lives in Guilford.

363
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Of course, you know the cottage is also in Guilford.

364
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,020
And he's somewhat confused.

365
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,020
I think he's probably really sweet,

366
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,020
but he's confused and sometimes very angry person.

367
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,020
But I just, let's listen to how his mind works.

368
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
Listen to this piece of feedback he sent me.

369
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Hello, I've been Roger here.

370
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,020
Now, you don't have to play this if you don't want to say that it's quite alarming.

371
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,020
Now, you're talking about how I just came on your show.

372
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,020
And I've just heard that someone's copied one of your pubs was.

373
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,020
I'm not sure what you know, but I heard that there's actually a pair of

374
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,020
Gapsuic 606 Road Letters, being cool, imagine I changed.

375
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,020
I found out today that the elderly has been Madonna

376
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,020
has started her own podcast,

377
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,020
well, it's the gay audience, son of her.

378
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,020
And a formula, certainly, that much wine steam has been done for about a year now.

379
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,020
She's even called herself much for having a sake.

380
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,020
The nice thing is, real much has gone and got taken out by a change.

381
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,020
And the imposter is now getting all the credit.

382
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,020
I mean, you're much bigger and older star than she is at them.

383
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,020
And you managed to age gracefully,

384
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,020
without resorting to stillness, people's work,

385
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,020
and very hardcore bras.

386
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
I think something is being done about the Charleston.

387
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,020
If you can ask your daily source code listeners

388
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,020
to become that report concerned,

389
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
then in the iTunes directly,

390
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,020
some Madonna's podcast.

391
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
Well, we can do it.

392
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,020
We'll get kicked out for copyright reasons.

393
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,020
But in that, I think the more direct approach might,

394
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,020
you know, I'm assuming you know where she lives from your NPD date.

395
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Now, I don't actually own the pub,

396
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,020
and not sure where you got the impression that I'd drive a mini from either,

397
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,020
but I actually don't drive at all.

398
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,020
But I was wondering, if you want to tell you a little how the culture

399
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
over some Madonna's house,

400
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,020
and that we can show things out with a once and for all,

401
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
I think it's the plummeted house.

402
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
You can always bring along some muscle,

403
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,020
but your church is quite handy, which is past.

404
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
Anyway, you take care, and talk to me,

405
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
just to sort all this mess out.

406
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,020
And it's not really much happening with me at the moment.

407
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
I've got a bunch of nails,

408
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
but after that it's,

409
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
see, see, have a try to skin it,

410
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
so let me see others.

411
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Bye-bye.

412
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,020
Okay.

413
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
If you couldn't hear what that was all about,

414
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,020
now would be the time to hit your little rewind button,

415
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
and listen to it again.

416
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
That's what I had to do.

417
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,020
Okay, here's what I think Roger is saying.

418
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:24,020
He's angry because he feels that Madonna,

419
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,020
known in the UK as Madge,

420
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,020
has stolen Madge Weinstein's idea,

421
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,020
or whatever he thinks the copyright is.

422
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
He's calling it copyright,

423
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
and that, I don't know if this is true,

424
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,020
I don't think Madge Weinstein,

425
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,020
I think East Radio has been kicked off of iTunes,

426
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,020
but I'm saying that I should go and take care of the imposter,

427
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,020
which apparently Madonna would be the imposter.

428
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
Roger, it's okay.

429
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Don't worry about it,

430
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
and stay away from Madonna.

431
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,020
And she's not known as Madge anywhere,

432
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,020
but here, so Madge can be the US Madge,

433
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
Madge Weinstein,

434
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,020
and Madonna can be the British Madge.

435
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,020
And that'll solve it.

436
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Okay, hopefully that works for you, Roger.

437
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,020
And I'm kind of happy you don't have a car.

438
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
Really?

439
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,020
Hey, I know I'm sure you're going to be this a sledge.

440
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Very many of the exposed sledge,

441
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
from the I love kitty, it's podcast.

442
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,020
That's very, very, very, very, very, that I love night's dot com.

443
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,020
And we spot like the night on the horse for the lens.

444
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,020
Yeah, can I teach you a start com?

445
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Yeah.

446
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,020
Yeah.

447
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,020
Yeah.

448
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,020
Yeah.

449
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
Yeah.

450
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
Yeah.

451
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
Yeah.

452
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
Yeah.

453
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
Yeah.

454
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Yeah.

455
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
All right.

456
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
Okay.

457
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,020
Yeah.

458
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Welcome to me on academically.

459
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,020
Oh, you, get out.

460
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Oh.

461
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
Hey, everybody.

462
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Hi.

463
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:03,020
What do you call this isestone

464
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,020
right now?

465
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,020
Sometimes I panic about it.

466
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,020
I can't take that little while,

467
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,020
because definitely it happened.

468
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:18,460
one song every show and the audience decides whether it's a good song or bad song.

469
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,820
Songs like these is the Hanukkah overtures by the Nishama Orchestra.

470
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,740
Also, we have commissioned the artist themselves to play these songs, so it's completely

471
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,780
hard to say it for us to guess what we're saying.

472
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,340
Anyway, I'm hoping to play this, so thank you for playing it, and everyone out there

473
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,060
in Hebrew, Kaga, Hanukkah, Samayah, I'd be happy to come up with.

474
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:44,900
For a Merry Christmas, Happy Kwanza, Happy New Year, and keep on listening to WWE WWE

475
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:53,220

476
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,380
Happy Holidays, everybody.

477
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:01,660
I need to make the back stop the beat, and that's all I'm saying about it.

478
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660

485
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,900
Fantastic.

486
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,960
Ladies and gentlemen there's somemore Castro under direction of tonight's conductor Steve

487
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,260
Bill.

488
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,720
That was live, crap.

489
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,620
Thank you very much, I really appreciate of that.

490
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:37,740
It's been so hard to find a Hanukkah music that I like that sound up and up and

491
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,680
like a little, a little more modern,

492
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,000
like we've been finding all over the,

493
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,280
the Pods and Music Network in the holiday section.

494
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,720
And you actually said,

495
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
you know, you can fade the music out whenever you want to.

496
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm like, no, but that's the beauty of podcasting

497
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,400
because I can just let that play.

498
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
If someone doesn't like it,

499
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
they can shuttle past it.

500
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,840
They can fade it out.

501
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,120
The listeners and control.

502
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,480
I love that.

503
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
And if you have more Hanukkah songs,

504
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,000
please let me know about them.

505
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And if you know anyone who has them and artist

506
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,360
and they're asking if they wanna submit it

507
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,360
for the Pods and Music Network,

508
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,920
I know I sound like a broken record,

509
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,480
but I'm so excited about it.

510
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,560
Oh yeah, yes, that I do my typical scan

511
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,720
of all the new podcast and video podcasts.

512
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,440
There was Daily Planet TV and Lusion.

513
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,560
And that is spelled Lima Uniform Shira,

514
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,320
India, Alpha, November.

515
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,120
I spelled it incorrectly previously in this show notes,

516
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,120
I believe, responded to my request about information

517
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,320
about how he puts his show together.

518
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,760
And indeed, he is using the wire screen software.

519
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,440
And he actually showed us, he has two cameras hooked up

520
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,840
to his Mac, it's amazing, he's got a regular camera.

521
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,840
I think probably camcorder through what must be Firewire.

522
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,400
And then he has an eyesight cam hooked up

523
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,400
and he actually showed his entire screen as layout.

524
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,240
He's a one-man band and I love it.

525
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,160
And I wanna congratulate him, it was beautiful man.

526
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,400
He played a sound, which was so, you know what,

527
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,440
let me play the sound for you.

528
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,200
It was so beautiful.

529
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,840
Hold on, I gotta fire this up in a quick time.

530
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,480
Okay, so this is the actual video,

531
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,680
let me see if we fast forward,

532
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,800
it was somewhere around here.

533
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,640
Resilient prostitutes.

534
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,200
The fashion show, that wasn't the one, obviously,

535
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,600
here comes first, too, you know, the two Adam Currys.

536
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,800
Well, here's the third.

537
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,640
Here's the, okay, listen to this.

538
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:39,640
That sounds you hear, it's my baby's heartbeat.

539
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,640
You can just hear lures, heart beat in the background,

540
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
lures in my life.

541
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,640
In that beautiful, so he got an ultrasound of his unborn child

542
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,440
of, it's heart beating, and any, any dad, any parent,

543
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,640
but that, or mom, was ever heard that,

544
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,440
knows what a beautiful sound that is,

545
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,840
was really cool the way he shared that on the show.

546
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,640
DailyPlanet TV, dot net, fantastic video podcast.

547
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,440
I'm subscribed, and I love it.

548
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,640
Okay, DailySourceCode.com is where you can find the,

549
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,040
the podcast feed for the DailySourceCode,

550
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,640
where you can always find updated episodes.

551
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
Of course, I crosspost it to curry.com,

552
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,440
my weblog, where all kinds of other crap gets written down

553
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,640
and documented.

554
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,920
If you want to submit a promo for the show,

555
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,640
and I still could use some more holiday greetings

556
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,240
for xmus.podshow.com.

557
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
I'm still releasing two songs every single day,

558
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,440
mixing them together.

559
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,040
So we adhere to the, the license that we have with artists

560
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,540
who upload to the podcast and music network.

561
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,240
But it's really a cool way to fill up your MP3 player

562
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,940
with holiday tunes.

563
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,740
I don't just want to be Christmas, by the way.

564
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,640
And, you know, so if you've got Hanukkah tunes

565
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,540
or Kwanza or whatever, you know, send it in.

566
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,140
It's all about the whole festive spirit.

567
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Then it's right, I said promo.podshow.com.

568
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,040
I got that one, right?

569
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,640
That's where you can upload your promos.

570
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,040
It's a great way to, for me, at least,

571
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,840
to keep a track of where everything is,

572
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,640
instead of people sending it into my Gmail.

573
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,440
Gmail, fullness count today.

574
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,840
Let's see.

575
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
What are we seeing?

576
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,540
I've got to go back here.

577
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,840
Where's my Gmail screen?

578
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Shiza.

579
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,340
Hold on.

580
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,340
I'll tell you, we were 92% yesterday.

581
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,840
And what are we at today?

582
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,440
That's 92% of four gigs.

583
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,640
93%.

584
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,340
So does that mean I'll only have seven more days

585
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,040
if it's rising at 1% a day?

586
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
And then I have to go start deleting stuff again.

587
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,840
I certainly hope not.

588
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,640
Okay, wine that I've done with one more song

589
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,040
from the podcast music network.

590
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,740
Even though it's a summer song,

591
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,840
it has a kind of holiday feel to it.

592
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,440
Yeah, that's the point I know it's always cool.

593
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Relax.

594
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
Yeah.

595
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,240
For the lovers out there,

596
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,240
just turn your ring and get one band.

597
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
It's fine, that it's cool.

598
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
Yeah.

599
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,840
Instead of some a feeling,

600
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,240
yeah, I'm chillin' with a friend's party in the morning.

601
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,040
Trains around the way bend these days.

602
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,240
It's been in the old days, been in superb.

603
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,640
Remaining it's in the old days.

604
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,840
Women don't check it for a thug to take home.

605
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,640
They don't roam around the two in the mall.

606
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,440
Everybody look at things for us.

607
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,240
We got some grub on the grill, so I'm eating.

608
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,040
I think my split love in the middle.

609
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,840
You can get them.

610
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,640
Children in the middle with street dancing.

611
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,240
As per ladies, the chef and ladies smokey with Samsung blowing

612
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,440
on wood, showing on wood.

613
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,240
It's so good.

614
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,640
It don't matter when you hang on, slang is understood.

615
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
How the time is, you'd like to eat and roll baby.

616
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,240
It's like you don't die to say it's cool.

617
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,640
Maybe having your ability to celebrate like the late high

618
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,840
Saturday pop club.

619
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,240
High sweat if you cut in the room.

620
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,840
Free back with a green bottle.

621
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
Z's taking a look.

622
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,940
The music never stops in my city.

623
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,140
Hotel is packed with habdiparties by $78.

624
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,640
You The Lost Half the Body,

625
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
To LPM, the party's starting over

626
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
Yeah, folks, I'll have naked in the blazes

627
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
It's on for the time we wasted waiting

628
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
No days to come, we got the motorcycle blazing

629
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,640
But ain't nobody hating, you're just strictly hospitality

630
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,640
And I realize it, because it's even green bills are large accounts

631
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
The theory you banked, the heart of you bounce

632
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,640
No doubt, ain't nothing like the summertime playing in the sand

633
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
Layout and give blazes to your favorite jam

634
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,640
You can spend a path for the riddle, let the good times roll

635
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,640
With no worries, you get wide open and no worries

636
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
Yeah, I'm just feeling what I'm saying

637
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:40,840
I've paid the yield blind for work-up used to Side где

638
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,500
The brands I rise sometimes are

639
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,940
Oh, yeah, focused to wax W-ade up

640
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:52,840
Sris, weather, Tommy, you're good

641
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
Who's on the field?

642
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,600
You're here, you show mine with an cyan

643
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,440
Look at me, andíveis make you mind

644
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,640
That's the same. Make you feel like I'm falling

645
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,840
Nice Carl, you said Oh you can afford a few

646
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,740
1900ols on the field. I like that

647
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,240
I like you

648
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,240
She loves you

649
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:38,240

650
00:45:38,240 --> 00:46:08,240

651
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,880
on the feet-in- that's the playing.

652
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,080
I know the way I know it was soлу-Blanc thing.

653
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,780
Yeah.

654
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:25,780
Oh.

655
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,620
I'm recommended by Sourcecoida listener.

656
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,540
With the link to the Potter & P dependent on Rota I was here very cool.

657
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,460
His hith chiker is Sarmir Fielaно.

658
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,480
I'm not quite sure what it was like, if it made the track,

659
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,680
track, or was my setup, but it felt like on some of the bass tones, it was kind of like

660
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,920
the track was stuttering a little bit, sorry about that, not quite sure it was going on.

661
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,520
Okay, how cool is that?

662
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:55,600
We went from Christmas song to people, which is totally funk, R&B, then we went to some

663
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,280
Hanukkah music and ended up with a summer song.

664
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,160
I love that.

665
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,760

If you'd like one or two, there may be a couple more on the list there that you're digging,

673
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,000
there's always a link to the artist's website, and two other shows that I've played, which

674
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,440
will, of course, lead you to probably other music that you like.

675
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
We thought about that shit.

676
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,720
Okay, so as I said, I'm off tomorrow morning, right, and early, maybe I'll do an update

677
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,720
from the condo on Sunday.

678
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,360
I know when I get in Saturday afternoon, I know that I immediately have to start mopping

679
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:57,000
the floor because I kind of left it a mess, herid exit a couple of weeks ago when I left.

680
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,680
So some vacuuming and mopping is an order, everything else should be, and maybe

681
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,720
all change the sheets on the bed, they've just been sitting there rotting away for three

682
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:13,360
weeks, and yeah, we'll have another week of stuff from the condo information about what

683
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
we're up to.

684
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,280
We've got the Christmas party on the way, and I hope that you have a fantastic Friday

685
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,840
or weekend whenever you're hearing this.

686
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,840
Take care, everybody.

687
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Have a good one.

688
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,720
Pot show.

689
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,960
Nothing says love and light, pot show from the oven.
