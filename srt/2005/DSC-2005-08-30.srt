1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Dota Shara Charley 2-3-1

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You're DJs!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Are you the next player?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Your DJ has only just begun

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're fantastic

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And it is the 30th of August 2005

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome to the daily source code

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Another beautiful day in the UK

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here at Curry Cottage

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We've got the Conveyor role in the high speed

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The air cooled fan

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Because of course air conditioners

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's not excessive

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Homes built in the 1930s

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In affluent residential areas of Surrey

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's quite unbelievable

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's unbelievable

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, okay

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, they start off a little bit slower than normal

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Right now it's 434pm

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's a little bit later than usual

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Patricia definitely needed to go to the doctor this morning

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Looks like

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What I had in New York

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The full on full blown bronchial infection

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That she kind of skated through

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, she's got it

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And so I had to go get some penicillin

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, you know, she's a danger to society

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
With all that cough medicine you can't drive

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I gladly took over the driving duties

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, so I'm a little confused by all the reports that have come in

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
About Hurricane Katrina

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Some say, oh, wasn't all that bad

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Some say it's horrible

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't know, I'm hearing reports of 20 feet of water

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That sounds pretty bad to me

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And 50 people died

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Man

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Of course with such a huge evacuation

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Something's always bound to happen

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But that is extremely sad

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I guess we wait for some other water to drain

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And the cleanup to begin is going to be quite

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Quite a big job

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And last night the MTV Video Music Awards

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Rolled out here in the UK, of course

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
One day after the fact

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I'll have some comments on that

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
My favorite definitely from the entire show

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Had to be Gwen Stefani just the way she looks

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She acts the video

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The whole Gwen vibe is fantastic

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So how about this smash up just for her?

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:30,040
she's like we're all ready.

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,080
yeah

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,460
I love it pretty much, I love it

62
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,900
You and me, when they're open, they'll call them

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,900
I'm in the camera, but it's all

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,900
The lack of justice has less to pass, less to pass, less

65
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,900
I don't know if I pass, crack, ladies, don't use that track

66
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
It's my talker, little touch

67
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
It's the love, it's the name, it's the real beer

68
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,900
It's the name, it's the real beer, it's the real beer

69
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,900
Watch me as a grab, take a sip, hop, hop, hop, hop

70
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,900
We got a ghost town, there's no town, it's so sad

71
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,900
You win, bling, don't fight with us, stay fight with us

72
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
Which no sad, you kill ain't so don't stop

73
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,900
Lily, yeah, until it's mise this shit, Luna

74
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Watch me react to every pass, less to Jahren

75
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,900
What the shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,900
Don't you just… don't you just know what's the shit, shit, shit

77
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,420
Whatever they're on the internet,

78
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,900
Don't you just know what the shit, shit, shit, shit

79
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
I feel like I'm not in a hurry, man

80
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,900
What the shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit

81
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Thank you, одну, Riversome and Beatmen

82
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Man, hero, same as life and death

83
00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:22,900
You know I'm no father, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother,

84
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:52,900
no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, no brother, he, no brother, oh brother,

85
00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:06,460
So now they're already fuf gonna extravaganza, Gwen Stefani versus Gorilla's Hall of

86
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,340
Backgirls feel good on your daily source code for August 30th, 2005.

87
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,100
It's nice and hot today, it's great outside, it's really beautiful, so I feel kind of like

88
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,100
a schmuck for sitting inside you hear the con bear blowing away in the background.

89
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,100
So we've discussed this over the past three shows about mashups and hit test and backtrack

90
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,860
podcast, all driving sales of back catalog, and I think I just wanted to read a couple

91
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,020
more pieces of email that came in, it really seems to be working, this is just a fraction

92
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,460
to people who actually feel like sending off an email to send off their comment, and

93
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,220
we really are driving sales with all this stuff.

94
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,660
Patrick Seaman says I listen to daily source code on my commute, which means that even when

95
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,420
I like the music from mashups and hit test, I can't buy it right away, back at home,

96
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,740
I usually don't know the title artists anymore, don't have time to listen to daily

97
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,540
source code either.

98
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,140
Would it be possible to list the songs used in mashups and hit test directly in the

99
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
show notes?

100
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,460
Well, you know, I've been investigating that, and I've signed up to become an affiliate

101
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,860
of the iTunes Music Store, and also talked to Jan Polet about it.

102
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,980
Jan said that he'd actually been doing that for a little while on JanPolet.com, and

103
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,700
he says it's such a hassle because you have to find the right versions, and he says,

104
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,960
you know, it would take him about 45 minutes to an hour every time he had to go into the

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,780
iTunes Music Store to actually, you know, get the links, and he said, all of that for

106
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,580
60 cents, didn't feel those words that I, that was his commission, I guess.

107
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,020
And also, that seems to be some problem with the Windows version, if you use an iTunes

108
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,740
link, but I'm not quite sure what the deal is on that.

109
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:54,340
Jason Hallowd says he actually, when he heard, was it, the data source code 230, so I

110
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,100
have the Windwood album back in the Highlight from iTunes already, it was inspired to listen

111
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,860
to it again after nearly a year away from me, still amazed how incredible Steve Windwood's

112
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,860
voice sounds.

113
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,340
I just want to thank for the podcast, blah, blah, oh man, I got to look at so many different

114
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,660
podcasts, people are sending all these links.

115
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,700
Okay, in Australia, it's not working too well as Craig Russell says, we're pissed off about

116
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
it.

117
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,180
There's no iTunes down under, next time you're talking to jobs, tell them to put a rocket

118
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,580
under the record company, because until then it's limewire for Aussies where no one makes

119
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
a penny.

120
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,380
Okay, good point.

121
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,300
John Knell, just bought fantasy off of iTunes that I remember how cool it's Groove and

122
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Boogie Wonderland.

123
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:42,140
Whereas I got them as well, that's after hearing the hit test, I think number 51.

124
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,940
In Neri or Relaana, Adam can begin to tell you how many tunes I've bought after hearing

125
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,900
mashups and hit test, I think I've spent in total to date since iTunes launched in

126
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:57,380
Canada, just over $3,000 on albums and audio books, oh man, of course that's Canadian,

127
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,860
so it's not all that much, right?

128
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,940
Here's a familiar name, Doug K, from IT conversations, Adam I should be embarrassed to tell

129
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
you this.

130
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,980
Wait, I am embarrassed to tell you, but after listening to the toxic shack mashup on

131
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,540
the daily source code last week, I went to iTunes and bought Britney Spears toxic, just

132
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,460
wanted to hear the bass line and it's original context, really trust me, it was just

133
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
the bass line.

134
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,260
I'll probably never buy another Britney Spears song again, but it's more evidence

135
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:30,020
that mashups do sell music, yes, how about John who says, I've bought at least 10 CDs

136
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,780
as a result of the daily source code, podcasts and also be great marketing tools if you're

137
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,540
on a Friday to put in the effort, if anyone needs an example, look at Rob Costlow, I gave

138
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,820
him his first Amazon.com review after hearing him on the show and his Amazon sales have surely

139
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
gone up.

140
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Yeah, he's doing great.

141
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,620
I think Rob is hooked up with a movie company now, and then this is all in the show notes

142
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:57,220
by the way, Craig Myers sent in this huge idea of a mashup generator and regenerator

143
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,980
with the idea, I think we've come up with something similar to this, but he really went

144
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,980
into a spec and he has an XML spec that he put in this email, you got to take a look at it.

145
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,060
The idea is basically, you have the tracks already, so you buy the tracks, but then you

146
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,340
have this piece of software that can regenerate the actual mix, the actual mashup.

147
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,780
I don't know, well, I mean, it would have to be a pretty sophisticated piece of software,

148
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,740
but definitely an interesting idea and something to think about for the developers out

149
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,140
there.

150
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,780
And here's one that I, you know, I've looked up licensing, I think I thought I'd looked

151
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:42,020
it up, licensing of MP3 because it's not free, it turns out.

152
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:50,220
Now they don't really have a podcast license, but if you want to use the MP3 standard,

153
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,820
I guess it's just a standard, not even the code or the codec or anything, it's just using

154
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,540
MP3 itself.

155
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,780
For instance, if you're making players, then you definitely have to pay a royalty, you have

156
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,300
to pay a license.

157
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,100
And from what I've been able to read and all the links to MP3 licensing.com and everything

158
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,940
is on the show notes, if you make over $100,000, then the licensing kicks in.

159
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,620
I think it's, I think it's 2% of all applicable revenue.

160
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:29,820
Now it also states that you have to pay this if you make money streaming using MP3.

161
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,860
And even though it doesn't say it explicitly, I'm pretty sure, and any lawyers out there,

162
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,620
I'm sure we'll be happy to check it out.

163
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,220
We'll note that there is enough description there to cover podcasting.

164
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,620
So the question is, how does this work?

165
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,740
Is that ad revenue, does it include barter?

166
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,780
I mean, is this just like a music license?

167
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,100
I think that there's something we have to look into there because there will be money made

168
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
with podcasting.

169
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:05,220
In fact, I wonder how Disney and ABC, radio.com and those guys do it, who are all getting

170
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,380
the big push through iTunes.

171
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,580
I wonder if they're paying their license.

172
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,900
So it might be time to bring them into the conversation because we want to make sure

173
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,500
that we're doing at least that part legally.

174
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,980
I mean, the music stuff is hard enough to figure it out.

175
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,620
And by the way, the new show notes, yeah, they suck so bad, they swallow.

176
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,620
Thank you.

177
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,300
Everyone was very, very clear about that.

178
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,100
So I won't be using the eye frame today.

179
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,260
I do like the dynamic nodes of the outline.

180
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,940
So I'll make sure there's a link to that.

181
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,620
And we'll just put top line nodes straight into the show notes, into the actual post because

182
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,460
of course, what everybody got was basically an eye frame with a URL, nothing else instead

183
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
of showing notes.

184
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,540
So apologies there.

185
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,060
And now, back to your regularly scheduled promos.

186
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,660
All right, well, John, we got to do a promo.

187
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,780
You know, we've been doing this show for three months and we've got to do a promo.

188
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,540
So can you think you could spare a minute of your time to join with me?

189
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,540
I'm hungry.

190
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,460
Oh, come on, man.

191
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
We just got to do this.

192
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,460
Adam Curry.

193
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,460
I listened to his show.

194
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,980
I was in Austin all last week.

195
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,300
He did a show a night day.

196
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Yeah.

197
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,380
And he was begging for promos every day.

198
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,980
He did one every day last week.

199
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,380
We only do one a week.

200
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,500
Well, he's committed.

201
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,140
He is.

202
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,140
Every day.

203
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,260
I guess if we do a promo, we got to tell people what we do, right?

204
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,540
So let's get the list together.

205
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,580
We're Mac Geeks.

206
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,460
And we share our gap.

207
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
We give.

208
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,620
So that's why we call it the Mac Geeks.

209
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,340
We share our knowledge with them, right?

210
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,100
And they share their knowledge with us in the form of usually audio feedback.

211
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,300
And Chris, we send that right up to the show because it makes the show easier to do when

212
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,940
we don't have to talk the whole way through, right?

213
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
Yeah.

214
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,500
And then when you get talking and you confuse the heck out of them, I'm there to help

215
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,820
kind of translate, right?

216
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
For everybody.

217
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,220
I agree with you, the only part of that.

218
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,060
We've got to refine it.

219
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,340
It is that sometimes you really get, I mean, I don't know what language you're speaking.

220
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,980
And I really got to help people out.

221
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,780
They write me a thank me, but I know share those with you because you'll get all

222
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
great.

223
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,340
You don't want to like to hear that.

224
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:19,980
So anyway, we are from the Mac Geeks, yes, come visit us at macabserver.com slash podcast

225
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,620
where you can search for Mac Geek Gab in iTunes and come join us because every week

226
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,420
we have a lot of fun sharing information and good geeking.

227
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,420
Thanks.

228
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:48,140
Hot Joe, content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

229
00:14:48,140 --> 00:15:07,820
You're listening to KZFO.

230
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,700
Do you ever get the feeling that you're not in charge of your government anymore?

231
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:17,380
This or a dictatorship, it'd be a heck a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.

232
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,580
Do you ever sit back and think, hmm, I could do better job.

233
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
It's hard work.

234
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,460
Well, now's your chance to find out.

235
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,860
Join us at KZFO as we explore the micro-national world, discussing the day's news and

236
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,860
you can interview the top news and it goes to the day.

237
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,780
You've done nothing, you have no idea, because that's too busy to defend myself.

238
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,700
What you've got is plenty of the option, and your goal now is to get bored about it.

239
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Yes!

240
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,140
And the point is, you're not losing nearly enough, you're not doing that.

241
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,500
You're not losing nearly enough, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not

242
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,820
doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not

243
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,180
doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not

244
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,180
doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're

245
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,180
not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that,

246
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,180
you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not

247
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,020
doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're

248
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,020
not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're

249
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,040
not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing this,

250
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,620
you're not doing that, you're not doing this, you are not doing that, you're not doing

251
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,220
that, you're not, we're not doing that, we're not doing that, you're not in that, you

252
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,500
know the way I do anything about what I, and you, you, you know the way that I

253
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,460
was doing that, I even went up there, really.

254
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,920
Because I honestly don't know what I'm doing, so they're exactly how you do that.

255
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
I'm feeling it, you know, you know, they're being pretty funny.

256
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,860
You factor in the energy input into the entire production process, it takes considerably

257
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,920
more fossil fuel energy to produce the fuels than you get out of them.

258
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,080
And that, as a according to a Cornell University and a University Berkeley study, 29% more

259
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,360
fossil energy to turn corn into ethanol, ethanol, but I don't think that's the same as

260
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
biodiesel.

261
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,880
I think that's just like, it's an ethanol, a step before ethanol, something like that.

262
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:14,240
I don't know, I really don't know, but I guess if, you know, why would you have to use

263
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,840
fossil fuel if you can make the ethanol fuel?

264
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,080
I don't know, maybe I thought there was some kind of perpetual motion you could get in there.

265
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,080
James Berghoud says,

266
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,080
make magazine did a 30 minute interview about biodiesel, then of course, forgot to put a link to it.

267
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,920
According to the make magazine podcast, the diesel burning vehicles made today are better

268
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,960
suited for biodiesel than those made back in the 80s, and apparently biodiesel smells like

269
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,760
french fries.

270
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,400
Eric says, I want to come time to rebuild or replace the engine in that 182 RG.

271
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,280
That's my plane.

272
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,800
You might want to consider a Delta Hawk diesel engine, which may affect you as a diesel

273
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,160
motor for the aircraft industry.

274
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,360
Awesome, awesome.

275
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,080
It's just such a weird idea to have a diesel engine in the air.

276
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,120
Oh, and he says, by the way, you need something cooler than the SESNO 182 RG, like a

277
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,720
CRS SR22, where a land care column be a 400.

278
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,360
Yeah, I don't know about the CRS SR22s.

279
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,600
You know, I don't know if you've seen them, you might may have heard that there are these airplanes

280
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,640
now, private planes that have a parachute, you should go to the website, it's fantastic.

281
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,680
You actually see that, you know, someone's pulled the shoot in this plane, it's just kind of

282
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,720
drifting down.

283
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,000
By the way, the plane is pretty much destroyed on impact, because you still come that, you know,

284
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,920
it's like basically landing a space capsule, only you're not landing in water, probably.

285
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,840
I don't like the the the CRS planes, and yeah, it does, I don't know, something,

286
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,920
something about them that just doesn't sit nice with me, but they look nice though, that's

287
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,400
sure, that's for sure. Andy White says, since you're interested in biodiesel,

288
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,480
I might find this link of interest shows how to make biodiesel use from cooking oil.

289
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,720
Now, that's when I'm looking for, so that's a freedom for freedomfuelusa.com, of course,

290
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,160
all of those links are in the show notes, and finally, Steph and C graves goes into great detail about

291
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,120
the thing we talked about this peak oil, that basically the oil reserves are gone, but now they're

292
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,920
different ways to get oil from from coal, for instance, so there's a lot going on with this

293
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,240
biodiesel, and I definitely want to keep my eye on it. Talked about teenagers as well, as well,

294
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,200
about them listening to the source code and responding, and about the relationship between

295
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,960
teenagers and parents, and Cabrin writes in Adam, heard the source code today, and heard the

296
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,240
feedback from an actual teenager, I'm a teenager, actually turning 16 soon, so around the same age group,

297
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,840
as with a lot of parents, I'm an only child, as is Christina, by the way, and my parents have never

298
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,360
experienced a child grow up, let alone a teenager growing up. Well, hold on a second, we actually

299
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,640
all were teenagers once, believe it or not. My parents seem to have a hard time letting go, at least

300
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,720
my mom, I guess it's different since this is feedback from a male teenager, but being a teenager is

301
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,640
hard enough with high school and friends, especially being the big geek I am, we don't need any

302
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,640
more trouble from parents, hope this will add to your experience with a teenager. All right, Cabrin,

303
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,080
a cabrin, I'm sorry, I'm mispronounced at Cabrin, thank you very much. So it sounds like there's

304
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,840
no discrimination there between guys and girls, you get the same treatment as the teenage girls who

305
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:27,960
are written in, and fra from Belfast, Francis actually, 15 years old from Belfast,

306
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,400
heard you talk about Mark the Surgeon. Last September, I was diagnosed with

307
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:42,920
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, I think that's it, HCM, currently to keep my heart under control,

308
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,160
I take 15 milligrams of the beta blocker pill a day, and I've done the 24 heart monitor thing,

309
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,400
since I always keep on forgetting to ask my doctor, are there any side effects I should expect

310
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,800
sometime or in the future from the beta blockers? That is a good question for the heart surgeon Mark,

311
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,960
let's see if he, if he replies, it's a good information to have in our household as well, since

312
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,440
Patricia also takes beta blockers every day for her heart condition. I'm not sure, I don't think it's

313
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,560
15 milligrams, I think she takes much less than that, I thought it was only five. Jeffrey

314
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,800
Snedden says I'm a 13 year old boy, my relationship with my dad is minimal, mainly because he's

315
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,400
either dealing with work stuff or with political stuff. He used to be head of the north east

316
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,880
five district council for which he received an OBE, that's an award here in the UK, this means

317
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,560
he's rarely in the house and not busy. When he is in the house, he's often dealing with his

318
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:43,320
2500 plus video collection. All right, we're kind of videos with, he should be podcasting.

319
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,720
All right Jeffrey, yeah, that does kind of suck. But at least you got a dad, I mean,

320
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,440
there's something to be said for that. I'm sure that if you really analyze it, it probably looks

321
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,240
well, and he probably is it, he's probably a good guy. And he should maybe figure out what he's

322
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,320
gotten that video collection, send something over. Ben Collins says last week and introduced

323
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,960
my son, Nick, who's 13 to the concept of a podcast. We listen to a few that I subscribe to,

324
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,440
spend some time talking about what he could do on one. He's pretty typical into what most

325
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,160
13 year old boys are into, but he worked on for four hours straight and he came up with his

326
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,600
own podcast, the game's snafu. I can't wait to hear a promo for that. He says as every teenager

327
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,520
will tell you, they're smart and insightful. We just heard that. And as any parent will tell you,

328
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,040
they need focus guidance and the creative outlet, podcasting fits the bill brilliantly.

329
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,520
It can't be simple or technically sophisticated, meaningful or silly. Whatever they want,

330
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,040
and it gives them something to do. It is active, not passive at a time in life when that's

331
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,800
really important. I agree, Ben. And that reminds me, the minute I'm done with today's source

332
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,040
code, I'm marching downstairs, and I'm going to get Christina to do her podcast, damn it.

333
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,000
All right, check this one out. This is kind of a match.

334
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,880
And in this album, I'm saying, I remember what it's all about now, you fuckers,

335
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,840
fuck you all. Thank you, John. So I'm saying, fuck you all. Imagine this.

336
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Thank you all very much. Thanks for the warm welcome man. Let's roll one, two, three,

337
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:48,360
four, imagine. There's no heaven heaven. It's easy. If you try, try, try, try.

338
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,640
No hell, below us, us, us, us, us. And above us, only sky, sky, sky, sky,

339
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:06,920
sky, sky, earth, imagine. All the people, all the people living, living, for today.

340
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:17,720
Imagine, there's no country, it's country, it's, it's not hard to do, hard to do,

341
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:26,840
nothing to kill or die for. And no religion, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too,

342
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:34,040
so good I need to imagine all the people, all the people living side by side,

343
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:49,480
peace, peace, peace. You could say, I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one, and I hope someday,

344
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:58,520
you'll join me in the world. We'll live as one, two, three, four, imagine, no possessions.

345
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:11,560
I wonder, wonder, if you can't, nobody's afraid, we're hungry, we're hungry, we're

346
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:27,960
under the man, imagine, all the people, ensuring all the world, imagine, thank you very much, peace.

347
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:49,880
We strive for peace, let's come together, on to a deep home, imagine.

348
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:23,480
All I'm saying is good peace, a chance, let's come together, let's come together,

349
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:47,400
all I'm saying is good peace, a chance, let's get these a chance, imagine,

350
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
We see this.

351
00:26:48,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Unless there's no place to rush, unless there's no end.

352
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Yeah, they will be full of water, and water will be full of water.

353
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
And now it's killed.

354
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
And now it's killed.

355
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,400
All of us want peace.

356
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Wax audio does it again.

357
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Imagine this.

358
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Wax audio dots.

359
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
It was an AU.

360
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I linked to that in the show notes.

361
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
That is your present.

362
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,400
And so just what?

363
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Once you stand over there, huh?

364
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
I have a microphone set up for you.

365
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
I love it.

366
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
And I heard you.

367
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Here's stand over there.

368
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I have a...

369
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
No.

370
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
This big thing?

371
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Oh!

372
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
It looks like a microphone.

373
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Yeah.

374
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
I'm talking to that.

375
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I see it.

376
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Can I hear you?

377
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
I said I loved it.

378
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
You sound like shit there.

379
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Hold on a second.

380
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Why is that?

381
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
That's not good.

382
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Hold on.

383
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Say something.

384
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Say something.

385
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Talk to you too.

386
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Yeah.

387
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
I give you a little bit of low end.

388
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Hold on a second.

389
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Say something else.

390
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Go ahead.

391
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
You got a talk.

392
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Well, you were talking about the beta blockers.

393
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah.

394
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Oh, man.

395
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
It sounds like shit.

396
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Let me turn this on.

397
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
You've gone.

398
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Shall I just go on that?

399
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Yeah.

400
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
You've gone.

401
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Yes, they told me that they're going to stop people in traffic.

402
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Not only to check their alcohol level.

403
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
And also a medicine.

404
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
And a bit of beta blockers.

405
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Because they find out that people on beta blockers are really stone.

406
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
No.

407
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Actually, the reaction is too slow.

408
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Really?

409
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Yeah.

410
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,400
And if people take a high dose of beta blockers, then they shouldn't drive.

411
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Isn't it ridiculous?

412
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Well, do you feel different when you use the beta blockers?

413
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
A little bit.

414
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,400
But that's good because I'm a little bit hyper.

415
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
No.

416
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
You don't say.

417
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I'm a bit hyper.

418
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,400
So that's why probably people are hyper.

419
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Get hard problems.

420
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
I think.

421
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Right.

422
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
So this is running to fast.

423
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
So this.

424
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,400
The boy that sent in the email says he takes 15 milligrams of beta blocker a day.

425
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
How much is he taking?

426
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
15.

427
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Oh, that's not much.

428
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Well, he's 13 years old.

429
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Oh, that's sad.

430
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Yeah.

431
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
He needs to take that already.

432
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Yeah.

433
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Oh.

434
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Yeah.

435
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
He has.

436
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
You know, what is it?

437
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Uh.

438
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Let's see if I can find it.

439
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Oh, here it is.

440
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Yes, it's started.

441
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
He has.

442
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
I just started.

443
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
He's so novice.

444
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
That hyper traffic cardiomyopathy.

445
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Oh.

446
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
What is the HCM?

447
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
You ever heard of him?

448
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
I think it's seen.

449
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Yeah.

450
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
That's what I think it is, too.

451
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
That's like what Bob has.

452
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I think.

453
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Are you a regular?

454
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
You think?

455
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
I don't know.

456
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Probably.

457
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Probably.

458
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,400
So besides the beta blocker, what else do you take?

459
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
By the way.

460
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,400
So we took Patricia to the doctor this morning because she has bronchitis.

461
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
So I'm myself.

462
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
You are not yourself.

463
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
But you look beautiful.

464
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
You look gorgeous.

465
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
I don't feel anything.

466
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
And I don't like to be sick.

467
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
No.

468
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
You don't get me in bed.

469
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
I don't like it.

470
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Excuse me?

471
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
I don't get you.

472
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
You know, like laying down and.

473
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
And.

474
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Oh.

475
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Okay.

476
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Because if you will feel better after a couple of days, I'm going to do that.

477
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
No.

478
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
You're not a take.

479
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
I can't stand on my feet anymore.

480
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Yeah.

481
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,400
But you have to be careful of your lungs because you've had two cases of pneumonia.

482
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Yeah.

483
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Okay.

484
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
No.

485
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Yeah.

486
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
I'm just sensitive.

487
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,400
You know, when I was a little girl, you have those kids that always cough.

488
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Yeah.

489
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
And that was you.

490
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Yeah.

491
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
It was me.

492
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Oh.

493
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Is that the fun?

494
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
And I think later in my.

495
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
You get these sort of things that if you get it cold.

496
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,400
It's just lingers on a little bit longer than yeah.

497
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
You got to be careful, man.

498
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I know.

499
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Okay.

500
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
So we had a.

501
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
A moxacillin.

502
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
I was that what you have a moxacillin.

503
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
That's my favorite.

504
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Yeah.

505
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Yeah.

506
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
What flavor?

507
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Yeah.

508
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
So that's good.

509
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
What flavor?

510
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
No.

511
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
No flavor.

512
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
I see crap flavor.

513
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
I've seen every member and she was little.

514
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Yeah.

515
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
She had that pinky milky stuff.

516
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Yeah.

517
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
That looks like a milkshake.

518
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Kids love that.

519
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
You have to really hide it from them.

520
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Which happens.

521
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Some kids.

522
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Lay off the tennis ceiling kid.

523
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
All right.

524
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
So yeah.

525
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Isn't it something get people stopped because.

526
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Because they might be on beta blockers.

527
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Yeah.

528
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
And then what?

529
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
And drive in.

530
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
I don't know.

531
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,400
You know, they're going to outlaw pornography on the internet in the UK.

532
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah.

533
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Violent pornography.

534
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Violent.

535
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
But okay.

536
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
So, but how about violent war pictures?

537
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Is that okay?

538
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
I mean, where do we draw the line with that shit?

539
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Yeah.

540
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Yeah.

541
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,400
So, well, I must say in the UK that they definitely don't.

542
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
They don't.

543
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,400
They, you know, it's about the sexual thing.

544
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
I just.

545
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
I'm just.

546
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
I'm fine.

547
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
I'm fine with that because I don't.

548
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
I don't want, you know.

549
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,400
I'm fine with them trying to to make up that law.

550
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
But I'd like.

551
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
I'd like to know the definition.

552
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
When is it violently sexual?

553
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
And when isn't it?

554
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
What's the line?

555
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
First and probably.

556
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Yeah.

557
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
So what's the line?

558
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
That's just I'm wondering how they're.

559
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Forget about how they're going to enforce it.

560
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Just something that's very sexy.

561
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Right.

562
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
If I, if I, if I have a picture of.

563
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Not that I have one.

564
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
But if I have a picture of someone in a leather outfit and.

565
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,400
And someone whipping them with a writing crop is that.

566
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
That's pretty sexual.

567
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
But it's that violently sexual.

568
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Do you like it?

569
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Maybe.

570
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Let's get arrested.

571
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
All right.

572
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Get out of my studio.

573
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Get out of my studio.

574
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I got to play some magic.

575
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Okay.

576
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Okay.

577
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Yeah.

578
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Okay.

579
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Stay as long as you want.

580
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Bye.

581
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Hi.

582
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
This is PW Phantom.

583
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Create a radio for your radio's digital flotsom.

584
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
And I'm here to tell you.

585
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I am a big fan of Mad Weinstein's yeast radio.

586
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,400
I am also here to make a confession.

587
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Anyone who is listened to digital flotsom knows that I often tell personal stories from my life.

588
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,400
But I think that you should know that there are still some things I haven't talked about.

589
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,400
One of those things is that for my whole adult life.

590
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I have secretly felt that I was a lesbian trapped in a man's body.

591
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
I just can't help it.

592
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Ever since puberty, I've just been attracted to women.

593
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Oh, I'm so glad I got that off my chest.

594
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
You rock my world.

595
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
And I'm not ashamed to say it.

596
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Hi Adam.

597
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Just a quick audio comment from myself.

598
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Mark Hunter, a host and producer of the Titan podcast.

599
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
One of the seven music podcasts.

600
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Over at the Podsafe music network as I'm sure you know.

601
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,400
And it's just that a little mention about the podcast called UK.

602
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,400
I've sent you a link to where you can download a promo that I've made.

603
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:34,400
The organizers of Podcast called PodcastCon UK are hopeful that you'd be able to play in the daily source code.

604
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Just to increase the exposure for the event.

605
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
There's been a lot of hard work put into it.

606
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,400
And as it's Europe's first podcast convention.

607
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,400
It's certainly as a milestone and it's a landmark in the history of Podcaston.

608
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,400
I believe there's this well over 100 attendees in place already.

609
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,400
The BBC are sending representatives as are the times of London.

610
00:34:53,400 --> 00:35:01,400
The garden, times magazine, virgin radio and several media and advertising companies are sending representatives along.

611
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I've been asked to do a speech about music podcasting.

612
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,400
And obviously I'll be heavily featuring the Podsafe music network.

613
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,400
And how that is the number one resource for music podcasters.

614
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Or for anyone that wants to have a music in their podcast.

615
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
But it's hopeful.

616
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Or it's hoped that perhaps you can play the promo on the daily source code or make some mention of PodcastCon UK on the daily source code.

617
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Just to keep everyone in the United Kingdom that's involved with this event.

618
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Feeling good about it.

619
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,400
And I think they just would really appreciate.

620
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,400
And just a little saying of support from the podfather himself Adam Curry.

621
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Thanks for listening to this Adam.

622
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,400
And I look forward to meeting up with you at the Podcast Expo in November over in California.

623
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
I'll be there. Cheers.

624
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Yeah, I was there.

625
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,400
And of course I want to go as well to podcastCon UK September 17th.

626
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,400
The problem is, and I just can't commit to anything these days.

627
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Because, you know, there's just so much going on.

628
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
In fact, Monday I'm flying to New York for two days.

629
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Then I'll come back on Thursday Friday Patricia and Christina.

630
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
They going off in the trip for the weekend.

631
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,400
They'll be back on Monday I believe.

632
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
And then either Monday or Tuesday or sometime in that week.

633
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I'm scheduled to go either back to New York or the San Francisco, probably San Francisco.

634
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
I just don't know yet.

635
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
So I really hope I can make it.

636
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
And I'm of course very supportive of this.

637
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
And it sounds like this is going to be a lot of great press covered.

638
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
It sounds like all the right people are going to be there.

639
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
And a hundred plus podcasts.

640
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,400
So definitely be on the lookout for more information about that.

641
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
And I have the promo as well.

642
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,400
So I'll be sure to roll that out either either in tomorrow or the day after source code.

643
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
And now.

644
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,400
The Pod Save Music portion of the show.

645
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I was listening to other promo and I heard cruise bucks come by again.

646
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Like, man, I haven't played that in a couple of days.

647
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
I heard it on a podcast.

648
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Tell the FCC to stick and kick in its cruise box on your dead source code.

649
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
Do you remember?

650
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
We back last summer.

651
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,400
When me, she made you a such a fucking mama.

652
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
No ending music.

653
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Nothing to funny.

654
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Cleared channel motherfuckers.

655
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
He had a problem on it.

656
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,400
But somebody heard it wrong.

657
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Now you can't have it all.

658
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I heard it on a podcast.

659
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Rockin' fucking radio you wanted.

660
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Got it?

661
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Just downloaded a part it on a podcast.

662
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:44,400
No one's gonna stop you telling FCC to stick and kick in the revisions.

663

ABC the look of love

702
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,680
Think it's the look of love if it is then it's ABC and the final one is always is number three

703
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,840
Yeah, you go she can kill with a smile she can run with a ride. I get a reward

707
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:45,520
Faith with her casual life and she only reveals what she wants you to see

708
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,000
She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me

709
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
Just don't take the wheel, Billy

710

And it's also answer number two in today's hit-tales. It's ABC this is poison arrow

713
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,400
