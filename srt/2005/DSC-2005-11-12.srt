00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,880
Delta Sierra Charlie 278. Good morning everybody. Welcome once again from Ontario, California.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,680
This is a daily source code. It's Saturday morning, crack a dawn. You can hear the lovely air

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,520
conditioner here in my Sheraton hotel suite kicking in once again. I can think of me

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,040
up all night. Every single time I would kick in or actually when it would kick off, turn

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:38,120
off, then I would wake up in a slight sweat. I am definitely jet-lagged. I got my nice inroom

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,640
coffee going here. I feed it just give it a little update on what's happening here at the

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,120
portable media expo. A couple of things that happened yesterday and just give you my

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,000
impression and talk about some other stuff. We'll enjoy a couple of coffee this morning

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,720
together. I was looking for some cool music to play on the Pod State Music Network and I actually

10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,120
wound up checking a couple of podcasts out, which is usually the way I find a new music or a music

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,000
that I want to play on the show. It doesn't necessarily have to be new. Some of that pod safe stuff

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,880
is years old and just now getting uploaded. I bumped into a Pod Show music re-wine number 7,

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:30,040
which I hadn't heard yet. This is the show. You can actually find that music.podshow.com

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,520
on the homepage. It's a 7 different Pod Show music podcasters and it's a selection. I think

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,040
Marcus from the scenes scene takes one or two songs and a little piece of a clip of each show

16
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,200
and puts that together at the end of the week, which is a really great way to listen to some

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,720
very diverse bunch of tunes. And CC Chapman played this song that I immediately went looking for

18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,000
and maybe I'm just not searching right, which doesn't make any sense or maybe it's just not uploaded,

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,760
but if CC played it then I'm going to assume that it is Pod safe and therefore playable on the show.

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,600
It's a perfect Saturday morning song. CC likened it to the Beatles and

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,680
something else. What do you say? I don't know. To me it was more like a Dooby Brothers vibe.

22
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,520
I think he's a Massachusetts native. The name of the band, I think it's just one guy is the candy

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,280
butchers. And so basically what I'm doing now is I'm ripping a piece of the Pod Show music re-wine.

24
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,840
I'm cutting CC off and going straight into the song. Oh shoot, hold on a second. Dude, I didn't

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,000
have my, I didn't have a Pod about hold on now. I got to listen to CC for a second hold on. Here it comes.

26
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,360
That's what she said. And I'm like, okay, what is this? What am I in for? And the next one?

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,200
Yeah, so CC was very surprised by this guy as well when he said, I think he saw him play live.

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,920
Play the most amazing rocking set I had ever seen. Come on, CC, get to it.

29
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,560
Me away. It was a mix of like the Beatles and Elvis Costs. Yeah, there you go. He said the Beatles

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:10,360
and Elvis Costello, but I disagree with that. It's much more like the house, like the dubies.

31
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,480
Played and played play. And the reason they did this was they didn't have a drum set that they're

32
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,200
waiting for. And I had this on a queue up too. And they rocked the house. Yeah, they rocked.

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,720
And that showed the musical talent. And I went home and I couldn't stop raving about them.

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,280
And I thought, come on, CC, there we go. Check this out. What are we going to do about Michael?

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
I think is the title.

36
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Dream the bottom and friends. Well, she knows what to do with Michael, she knows how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how

37
00:04:32,280 --> 00:05:02,280
how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how,

38
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,780
Oh, try to make him feel

39
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,980
That he's the one

40
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,780
He's his mother son

41
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Not like anyone

42
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,780
It just needs time to heal

43
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:43,780
Hey finally hooked up for the first time

44
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,280
The night before the fourth of July

45
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:56,780
He felt so awkward saying goodbye to the girl who just changed his life

46
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,780
Now my friend, they are in separate ball

47
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,780
She even gets that boy to go to the gym

48
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,280
Now if you don't think that's love

49
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
You must be cynical

50
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Oh, maybe man

51
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,780
You're just dreaming in French

52
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,780
Yeah, because he knows what to do with my call

53
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,280
He knows I'm against him

54
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,780
He's his mother son

55
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,780
Not like anyone

56
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,780
It just needs time to heal

57
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,780
Oh, she knows what to do with my call

58
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,780
He knows I'm against him

59
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,780
Yeah, that he's the one

60
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,780
He's mother son

61
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
Not like anyone

62
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,780
It just needs time to heal

63
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
Yeah, he's the one

64
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,780
He's his mother son

65
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Not like anyone

66
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,780
It just needs time to heal

67
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Oh, that's right

68
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,780
He just needs time to heal

69
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,780
He knows

70
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
Man

71
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
Is that a candy putster

72
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,780
He's quite easy

73
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Is that a Saturday morning song or what?

74
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,780
Oh man, I'm totally, totally loving that

75
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,780
The connectivity the hotel is not the best

76
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,780
So I wasn't able to download any other songs

77
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,780
I really just wanted to

78
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,780
Just wanted to do a quick podcast

79
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,780
Last night were the podcast awards

80
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,780
Not quite sure how they worked

81
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,780
I think the winners were announced a long long time ago

82
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,780
And this was essentially the award ceremony

83
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Got a real nice, like Lucite thing here

84
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,780
For 2005 podcast awards

85
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
I received the People's Choice Award

86
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,780
The people have spoken for best-produced daily source code

87
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,780
I really appreciate that, it's very nice

88
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,780
Meeting all kinds of cool people here

89
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,780
And last night at the award show

90
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Just unbelievable how many people I know about or heard of

91
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,780
Or recognize their voice

92
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
Oh, by the way, long with that prize

93
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
A long with the prize

94
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Came a check for $250

95
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Which I re-aworded to Doug K's podcast Academy

96
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
I think is fantastic

97
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,780
It's really it's for real, it's happening

98
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,780
I think the podcast Academy is something that we came up on

99
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,780
Came up with like an 18,000 feet flying back from Nomdex

100
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,780
And we were talking about that

101
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
Maybe it was the oxygen

102
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,780
But Doug certainly got that kick in man

103
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,780
That's very cool

104
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,780
And I also received

105
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,780
I think all the winners received a microphone

106
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
A brand new microphone

107
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,780
It's a

108
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Hile

109
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,780
I don't know about the name there

110
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,780
H-E-I-L

111
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,780
The PR40

112
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,780
Let me see what they say about the Hile

113
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Hile sound has established a reputation for innovation during the past 37 years

114
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,780
In the live concert sound market

115
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,780
Custom home theater industry

116
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,780
Building the highest quality microphones for the amateur radio and communications market

117
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Okay, so this is apparently their top of the line

118
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
Should we try it out?

119
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,780
Okay

120
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,780
Let's do that

121
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,780
That's actually a pretty cool idea

122
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
It has a

123
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,780
Let's see, does it have a

124
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,780
Let's fit on my stand here?

125
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Yeah, I think that will

126
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Okay

127
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,780
Here's what I'll do

128
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,780
Right now I'm on the AKG

129
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,780
See 1000s

130
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,780
So I have to turn off the Phantom power for second and an unplugged switch over

131
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,780
So just bear with me for one second

132
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,780
You'll kind of hear it plop and around

133
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
And then we'll be on the new mic

134
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Hold on

135
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Right

136
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Oh

137
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
It's actually sounds pretty good

138
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
Wow

139
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,780
This is nice

140
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Hold on, let me put it on the old stand

141
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
It has its own

142
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Shoot

143
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
It has its own

144
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
I'm talking into the side of it now

145
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
There we go

146
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,780
It has its own

147
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
Oh man

148
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,780
My other mic stand is really jacked

149
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,780
I'm tight here

150
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Hold on

151
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Here we go

152
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,780
It has a little hold

153
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,780
Oh shoot

154
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,780
So it has its own holder

155
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
But now I have to unplug

156
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,780
I unplug the mic again to make it work

157
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,780
Okay, hold on

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,780
Let me

159
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,780
Let me see

160
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,780
There's something I can play for you

161
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,780
No, I don't

162
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,780
Okay

163
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,780
We're already committed to this

164
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Stay with me

165
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Wow

166
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
They even have a

167
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Shoot hold on

168
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
I have to unplug it one more time

169
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Bear with me

170
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
There we go

171
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Wow

172
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
It looks very professional

173
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
I have to say

174
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
I think it sounds nice

175
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Let me just

176
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,780
Yeah, it has nice bottom range

177
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Nice bottom range

178
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,780
Yeah, lovely

179
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,780
Oh man

180
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
I got a cool sound clip

181
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
That somebody sent me

182
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
Check this out

183
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
This is

184
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,780
This is in regards to the discussion

185
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,780
about the curry cruiser

186
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,780
The jag xj

187
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
Superv8

188
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,780
That was sleek and smart

189
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,780
For men who'd like hand jobs

190
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,780
From beautiful women

191
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
They hardly know

192
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,780
That's from that crazy

193
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,780
Crazy movie

194
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,780
That's not again

195
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
I like that

196
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
That was sleek and smart

197
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,780
For men who'd like hand jobs

198
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,780
From beautiful women

199
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,780
They hardly know

200
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Fantastic

201
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,780
Last night

202
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
As I said

203
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
I was in bed around

204
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Around 1030

205
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,780
It was so tired

206
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,780
And I tried to listen to a couple of podcasts

207
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,780
And I watched a little bit of TV

208
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Which is completely boring

209
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
I think around 1am

210
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
Someone knocked on my door

211
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,780
Because it did wake me up

212
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
And then this morning

213
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
I saw an email

214
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
From around that time

215
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
That there was

216
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,780
Let's see if I can find it for you

217
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,780
That there was a pajama party

218
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
Oh yeah

219
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
This is a rowdy bunch

220
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
Let me tell you

221
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
Let me see

222
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
It was from

223
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Madge

224
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,780
Let's see

225
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
Come on Madge

226
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Where's your email

227
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
Now here we go

228
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
Sexie PJ podcast party

229
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,780
We're taping the pajama party in our room

230
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
I won't give you the number

231
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,780
In half an hour

232
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Soccer girl

233
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
P.K. and Jay chick

234
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Nicole and me

235
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,780
And a couple of creepy dudes

236
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
It'll be videotaped for the feed

237
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
Nicole looks sexy in a 90

238
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
That's a magic stylus

239
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
Who's a long for the ride

240
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
And this morning

241
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
The PJ party didn't show up

242
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
But some of the stuff that Madge did yesterday

243
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
It's pretty wrang actually

244
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,780
I don't know if I'm proud of it or not

245
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,780
And some other people were up really late

246
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
Drinkin' around the world

247
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,780
Oh wait, this is not the one

248
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,780
This is good too

249
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Today's podcast for October 20, 2005

250
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
Welcome back

251
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
This is something I found

252
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Long absence

253
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,780
Today we have a celebrity inspired term

254
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,780
Maya Copa

255
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
Recently Bill Gates used it when describing

256
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,780
Microsoft's failure to dominate the online music industry

257
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,780
Maya Copa

258
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
Spelled MEA

259
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,780
Space CU

260
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,780
LPA

261
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,780
Is a Latin phrase uttered to accept guilt

262
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,780
It translates to my fault

263
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
I think people like using the phrase

264
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,780
Because it is psychologically easier to say than my fault

265
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,780
Bill Gates used it

266
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
Maya Copa is interesting

267
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,780
While I'm sure Bill Gates

268
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,780
thinks he can dominate

269
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,780
Anything he directs Microsoft to tackle

270
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Apologizing for not dominating the online music industry

271
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Is awfully presumptuous

272
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
I've also heard Adam Curry drop this bit of Latin

273
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
On the daily source code

274
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,780
My notes go

275
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
I first heard it over a year ago

276
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,780
Back on September 27, 2004

277
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
Back in the early days of podcasting

278
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,780
I had no idea what that was for

279
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,780
I didn't know I inspired a word of the day

280
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,780
That's pretty cool

281
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,780
Now here's what I actually wanted to play for

282
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
This is pretty funny

283
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,780
I was up at a really pissed

284
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,780
Okay, so it pissed by the way

285
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Some of the blackberries to close

286
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Pist by the way

287
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
In Britain means drunk

288
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Not angry

289
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,780
I've just been listening to your podcast

290
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,780
From fuck knows

291
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,780
I just want to drop your line saying

292
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,780
Obviously you're in and out in and out of England

293
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
And around Europe

294
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,780
This guy is so here and we're listening to it

295
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Which means you're going to spend some time

296
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,780
Time in our car I am pissed

297
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,780
I'm recording this to some my eye book

298
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,780
So I'm just using that little PC

299
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,780
Little speaker

300
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Microphone

301
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,780
So you're going to spend time

302
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,780
Jettin around here and there

303
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
And all stuff

304
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,780
Which means you're going to hit centre of town sometime

305
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,780
I'm a TV producer doing some stuff at the moment

306
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:11,780
And I actually right now I'm doing some marketing bits and pieces for MTV

307
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,780
I know you know that company

308
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
The Viacom brand

309
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,780
People that do these things

310
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,780
That's not the exact

311
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,780
So basically

312
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,780
You're going to meet a whole lot of people out there

313
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,780
To do that podcast

314
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,780
Whatever the fuck that's all about

315
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,780
I don't know

316
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,780
You talk about it

317
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,780
What is your show about?

318
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,780
That is a very good question my friend

319
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,780
That is the $64,000 question

320
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,780
What is it about?

321
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,780
I don't know

322
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
It's about experimentation

323
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,780
It's about what's happening in podcasting

324
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,780
It's the way my mom keeps up with what I'm doing

325
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Exactly

326
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,780
Because I've listened to it for like the last three months

327
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Maybe less or two months

328
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
I don't know

329
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
What your podcast is about

330
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,780
I don't know what it's about

331
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
I listen to it

332
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
And I enjoy it

333
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
But then I listen to Brandon and Eric

334
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
Doing the MacGeek.com

335
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,780
When I listen to the Twit podcast

336
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
I like that

337
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,780
That's funny

338
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,780
Although they always talk about video

339
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,780
I don't know what the fuck they're talking about

340
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
The video thing

341
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,780
I think it's just very very

342
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
Americanized

343
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
I don't know

344
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
Is that the word?

345
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
Damn, I'm doing it

346
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
I don't know what you do

347
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
I'm an American word

348
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
And then say is that right

349
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
And then at accept

350
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
I'm not going to get feedback on this

351
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
I did love your

352
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,780
What was it?

353
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,780
GMT

354
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
No, no

355
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
What should be

356
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
Yes

357
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,780
It is standard time

358
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Is that a summertime

359
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
I enjoyed that

360
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
It made me smoke

361
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
Because I thought to myself

362
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
He means summer

363
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
I knew what you mean

364
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
It doesn't matter

365
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
I didn't need to write it

366
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,780
Anyway

367
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
What are these anal people about?

368
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,780
So, basically, a long short of it

369
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
My name is Charles

370
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm a person

371
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
I live in London

372
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,780
Right, I'm brother

373
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Love them what you do

374
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,780
I'd like to meet you

375
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Could you tell them I can interest in person

376
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,780
So, if you were very nice

377
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,780
Okay, then it goes on to give us phone numbers

378
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,780
Which are one play

379
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
That's what I like about the Brit's man

380
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,780
When they're drunk

381
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,780
When they're a little bit soft up

382
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
They're funny

383
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
They really are

384
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,780
There's a certain point where they

385
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
They can tip over

386
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,780
And they become a little aggressive

387
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
And angry

388
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,780
And unreasonable

389
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,780
Like most drunk people

390
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,780
But

391
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
Yeah, it's

392
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,780
And I'm not for it

393
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,780
By the way

394
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,780
Because drinking is a huge

395
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,780
Huge problem

396
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
And Christina's 15 years old

397
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,780
And the story she's told me about her friends

398
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,780
Getting just so drunk that their vomiting blood

399
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,780
It's very disturbing

400
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,780
But it's such a part of the culture there

401
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,780
Oh, that's my, actually set my alarm

402
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,780
The blackberry waking me up

403
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
You know what?

404
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
As I sit here

405
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,780
In this extremely depressing hotel room

406
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,780
By the way, what I think is a fantastic microphone sound

407
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,780
This is well worth coming to the expo

408
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Just to get this free mic

409
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,780
The sun is just coming up

410
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,780
I can see it coming through

411
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,780
The palm trees

412
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,780
The shades are cracked open just a little bit

413
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,780
I think it's the perfect

414
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Opportunity to play this song

415
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,780
Which I have played in my

416
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Was it the curry condo video that I did?

417
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
Jimmy Bratcher

418
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Restless for this song

419
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,780
Good morning

420
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,780
Nothing's wrong but it's alright

421
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,780
I lay me down to sleep tonight

422
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Toss and turn

423
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,780
Sleep on call

424
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Restless for the song

425
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:54,780
The dreamer dream with you

426
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,780
In view

427
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,780
Better times and dreams come true

428
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:12,780
As what open tell me where's the dawn

429
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,780
Restless for the song

430
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,780
The view from here

431
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,780
Don't darken

432
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:33,780
It's shout so clear in my mind

433
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Don't break in through darkness

434
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,780
Dreams come true

435
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,780
Better times

436
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,780
So hold me close

437
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,780
Sleep to me

438
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:02,780
For the dreams we've yet to see

439
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,780
Can't wait to see you

440
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,780
When the morning comes

441
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Restless for the song

442
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:50,780
So hold me close

443
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,780
Sleep to me

444
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,780
For the dreams we've yet to see

445
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,780
Can't wait to see

446
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,780
When the morning comes

447
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Restless for the song

448
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,780
Restless for the song

449
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,780
That's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

450
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,780
It's such a long time

451
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,780
From his red CD

452
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

453
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

454
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

455
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

456
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

457
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

458
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

459
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

460
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

461
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

462
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

463
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

464
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,780
It's just one of the prettiest songs I've heard

465
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,780
My going purely pot safe and proud to be that way I might say that

466
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,780
It was a really good discussion actually

467
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,780
There was another guy on who I forgot What his name was

468
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,540
He has a streaming business

469
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,740
And he had some interesting information about that business model

470
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
I think at the end of the day we all agreed

471
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,740
That there's significant change of flow

472
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,740
And particularly in podcasting with consegu

473
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,100
We're just routing around

474
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,540
all of the licensing issues, you know, it's the music industry's problem. They're bad,

475
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:43,060
but they aren't able to license stuff to us. See what else regarding Podsake music? Oh,

476
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,460
there's a new digital flots amount, P-Dub did an excellent, and you know, I should play a little

477
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,860
piece of that for you, just the beginning of it, because it's so excited. You know, P-Dub, we hired him

478
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:00,660
before a Podsho was a company to do the serious show. And actually, I've never met him in person,

479
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,460
which is just a travesty, although Madge Weinstein thought that she met him on one of the video

480
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,780
cast that I saw, turned out to be Chris Kringle. Let me see if I can just bring this up for you,

481
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:18,340
because P-Dub has now also decided to go 100% Podsake, which unfortunately also means that little

482
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:25,860
that signature, beginning that he has, today, today, today, that's kind of his digital flots.

483
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,780
I'm starting thing there, his tune. I'll just play a little bit, because I think the, I think he

484
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,500
really sums it all up. And as you listen to this digital flotsome episode number, what is it's 20?

485
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,940
Oh, my second, this has 26, but I had 27. Shoot, I have to get it from the, it has an updated

486
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,020
yet, and I too, thank you, iTunes. Okay, I'll get it straight from his site that I'll work too.

487
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:04,260
So we start off basically pronouncing the, what is this? Man, I don't understand what's happening

488
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,740
with my website. It really fricking blows. I want to move this thing to WordPress so bad.

489
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,260
Okay, let me go to digital flotsome. I'll get it straight from digital flot. I thought I'd link to it.

490
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:20,340
Okay, yeah, it's the rest-in-piece edition. So it's just going to open it with iTunes.

491
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,140
What the hell is going on here? Oh, it's streaming? Interesting. Okay, let's see if that actually works.

492
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,060
Oh, maybe it would help if I, there we go.

493
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,940
He talks about the new revolution later on. One thing I do know for sure, it's over. There's no,

494
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,060
I'm not going to be playing anymore licensed music. If it's not registered through the

495
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:51,140
Podsafe Music Network, I'm going 100% Podsafe from this moment on. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's

496
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,140
over.

497
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,380
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together on this solemn occasion

498
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:12,740
to mourn the tragic passing of two siblings, the recording industry and the broadcasting industry.

499
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:22,500
Any time a passing like this comes so unexpectedly, it is hard for us to understand.

500
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:30,020
We often cry out, why Lord? Why were they taken?

501
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,220
Often their passing seems so senseless, so unforeseeable.

502
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:45,780
But I am here to tell you that this is an instance where I think I can bring the grieving

503
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:54,580
some comfort in the knowledge that even this tragic passing can be explained in a way that anyone

504
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,060
can understand.

505
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:09,380
The idiots brought it on themselves. They sinned until they were punished for their single-minded

506
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:17,860
green and lack of imagination made ways suffer for eternity.

507
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:53,540
How cool is that, huh? Hello and welcome to another edition of digital flat out.

508
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,740
You really should listen to the show to get the full effect. While that was playing, by the way,

509
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:04,420
I opened another piece of my little prize package there. This is a shock mount for the microphone.

510
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:09,940
Built by those who care and fair few heights of Illinois, USA. I can tell you guys care because this is

511
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,460
some good ass shit, man. I like this. So it has one of those wire frames, real professional looking

512
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,820
and I don't even need a like a plop filter. Well, maybe a little bit, but I've got a really

513
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:26,660
like the sound of this mic. This is cool. Something else that I heard last night was a cotton

514
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:34,420
steam song podcast, KTSP and I was so sweet because she obviously also heard about me going

515
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,580
to a purely pod safe and she dedicated an entire show to me, which was just so beautiful.

516
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,980
The flying edition, of course, all kinds of flying songs. So I don't know what she's going to do

517
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,420
now that now that that is no longer going to be legal anywhere, but also not in the Netherlands.

518
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,860
I wonder she's going to continue with that show. It's too bad because the way she

519
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:02,980
aggregates those songs and gets all the right themes together. It's fantastic. It's my favorite

520
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,300
favorite podcast for a Sunday late morning. See who else did I want to talk about?

521
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:16,500
Oh, yeah, yesterday during the awards and the place was packed and still it's such a fun vibe

522
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,220
and there's so many different people here. There are lots of listeners who

523
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:32,260
sponsored their like the tartan podcast. What's his name? Mark from the tartan podcast.

524
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:40,020
He's from Scotland and one of his biggest fans, one of his listeners, co-sponsored his trip out here

525
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:46,340
and I talk with her for a while and she's just really into it and she's in a totally different

526
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,780
business and there were listeners who came up to me yesterday who were big fans of a podcast

527
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:59,620
heard about the expo and just wanted to come up and meet everybody and I hold on. I should get my cards

528
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:07,620
one second. Just stay right there, okay. Let me just grab this out of my. Oh man, where did I put them?

529
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:14,340
Oh, here they are. I think this is it. It was I think was Darren. He introduced himself as one of the

530
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:22,020
blind casters, which to me was very, very evident when he came up to me. This is the guy actually

531
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,700
who wrote me an email and pitched him on and was kind of mean in his approach. I don't have his

532
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:34,100
card here about some accessibility features, but we had a really great chat surrounded by

533
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,820
million other people which is what I hate about these types of gatherings as you can never really

534
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,820
sit down and just chat with someone which is actually why we have the the pod show lounge

535
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,740
is so we could just you know have a place where the pod show people can hang out and talk with

536
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,540
people and because you know there's like stars man, the frickin celebrities. Look at Dawn Drew is

537
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:59,140
amazing yesterday. It's like sunny and share on acid. More acid than sunny and share. So anyway,

538
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:05,140
so Darren had some really good remarks about the pod safe music network, particularly while

539
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:12,260
it's all about accessibility and I really want to make it our mission and this is a message to

540
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,940
pod show HQ as well. In all the building that we're doing, let's try and put these accessibility

541
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:25,220
features for a huge core audience of pod casting, namely people who are blind. Let's make sure we

542
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:32,580
put that into the DNA of our thinking and that we always develop with that in mind because there

543
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,900
are some things particularly about the pod safe music network which is really bogus that don't

544
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:43,220
work for instance the verification email. There's some flash is a huge problem and I don't know

545
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,980
if there's like alt tags or accessibility features and flash that you can use but I can certainly

546
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:56,980
see why flash interfaces don't work for the blind. So anyway so yeah he was going through this

547
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,380
whole list of things like dude you know I've afforded one or two of these emails that I've caught

548
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,580
you know that you sent to me but why don't we just give you a login to our bugzilla

549
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:13,460
database which is if you're not familiar with bugzilla you know look it up but it's essentially an

550
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:22,020
open source database where you can drop in bug reports and there's you know tickets are assigned

551
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,820
to them and you know it can go through a resolution path so that eventually stuff basically gets

552
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,180
done and of course it being open source and put together by a whole bunch of really smart people

553
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:39,060
it is very accessible so Darren was was completely you know over the just overjoyed with that and so

554
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,820
we're going to have him doing some QA and helping us out which I think is a great idea to have

555
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:50,900
your users those who are familiar with it and Darren is familiar with the with programs like

556
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,980
bugzilla actually you know I think that's kind of what was designed for wasn't it for users to

557
00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:03,460
be able to feed back I think so let's see I had another message here let's just I'm just going

558
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,020
through the through the Gmail box and seeing what's up let's check this out for a sec well shoot

559
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,180
Steve Pender from karate cast nice the little like to have been there with you in Ontario

560
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:18,420
California with the media expo but the money hasn't exactly been there yet but we're working on it

561
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,060
and we have a chance in the near future to possibly make some money at this so that's good we're

562
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,940
working in that direction right on but I kind of wanted to talk to you a little bit about

563
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,420
what's been going on in your show notes I'm sure you've read it with some of the

564
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,900
just the crap and what he's talking about is the comments not the show notes but the comments

565
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,380
I think this is the thing if you've looked at the comments on curry dot com between

566
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,820
nightwise and Michaels in there who actually does the show notes and a couple other people even

567
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,500
I jumped into this thread and you know for 25 years now I've been studying the reality of

568
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:01,140
confrontations and what really amazes me is the crowing one could do on the internet the language

569
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:07,220
that is used here by some people would never be used face to face it's how bravely people run

570
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:12,980
there mouth online that is sometimes hysterical the internet has become a place where people with

571
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,260
zero confidence and spine can posture a bit by sticking their chest out and beating it like a

572
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,700
babbling gorilla I've met some of these internet critics face to face and they can barely get a

573
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,420
word out without wetting themselves the bickering in your show notes from Wednesday's show

574
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:35,460
about you calling someone out on your show was like comic relief I learned a long time ago

575
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,900
that one share critics will complain you know about how they're a life's treating them

576
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,500
and do absolutely nothing to change it so Adam if you don't mind I just like to say something to

577
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:54,340
these few one share warriors yes Adam Curry has a podcast show yes it is popular

578
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:01,060
yes if you're hearing this then you listen to it yes he has an agenda it's called the pursuit of

579
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:08,660
his family's happiness and yes he has that right in yes you have that right to voice your opinion

580
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:14,500
as does he and yes you're allowed to say stupid things to him and you should be happy he even

581
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,500
allows you to leave him messages and yes when you say something completely moronic he has the right

582
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,100
to publicly announce your stupidity hey man you should be thankful someone is recognized you for

583
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,980
your true calling in fact people like you should post their resumes on his show notes for possible

584
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:37,060
job opportunities you could sign it with a big ink stamp of a butt so people can recognize it as your

585
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:44,100
hi I'm Steve Pender the host of karate cast at www dot karate cast dot com

586
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,500
thanks Steve good pipes there man nice processing that's not really good

587
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,140
if you're here at the expo you've probably seen the t-shirts the unditioned t-shirts

588
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,980
if you go to podshow dot com you can also see kind of what that looks like there's an unditioned

589
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:05,140
banner that shows up a lot of people asking about that uh it is something that we're ramping up

590
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:12,100
wasn't ready to fully announce here at the uh at the expo I said and you know and it's also

591
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:18,900
not something you announce just something you do I think that if you look at the entire universe of

592
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:25,780
podcasters which is what 10,000 registered now I'm like very stuff that 10,000 registered podcasters

593
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:32,740
it's a podcast alley in any pod or dot org the the the 1000 most enthusiastic

594
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:41,700
shit man when we fill that thing on the floor um now let me rephrase that the people who came out here

595
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,940
who were able to come out not everyone who was it was enthusiastic podcaster and passionate about

596
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,900
what they're doing could come out but the people came out here are really very motivated and a big topic

597
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,980
of discussion is how do we make money on this and i promise you that that was uh what podshow

598
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,180
is all about and then we're going to um going to start answering some of those questions um as you

599
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:09,460
know there's a number of podcasters um which i lovingly call the pod squad uh who have uh essentially

600
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,660
been able to give up their quit their day job and podcast full time and it's not just their own podcast

601
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,060
but they're producing other podcasters and they're really working with us on creating what we think

602
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:30,660
will be uh the next set of tools needed for podcasters um and probably more importantly uh what

603
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:38,900
we need to grow our audiences and acquire listeners and uh having met hundreds of you here at the

604
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,700
expo and many hundreds more that i haven't been able to meet and probably won't just because there

605
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:50,660
is enough time um every single one of you seems really incredibly qualified and we feel that there's

606
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:58,980
a way and a process um to find uh people who we can basically help quit their day job if not just

607
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,100
say hey congratulations quit your day job. i think there's also a listener side to that by the way

608
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:09,380
of i've seen all these um these these really passionate listeners who were promoting their favorite

609
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,540
podcast uh i think uh that's a very valuable uh skill and and passion something else that can be

610
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,860
rural rewarded by allowing um great listeners and sponsors of podcast to quit their day job

611
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:27,780
that's really what this audition is about and stay tuned because uh in the coming weeks i'll be

612
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:35,940
explaining more about this and oh by the way everyone i mean everyone can participate and that's been

613
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:43,060
really uh pretty important point i think you're gonna like it the audition the largest promotion

614
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,180
podcasts about to hit you right between the ears

615
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:29,540
and the lips i'll either have your start tomorrow because i can't be around you and

616
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:42,900
i'll be with you if you refuse to come with me i'll go at a long

617
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:54,340
i'm waiting for a day when i can finally see

618
00:37:54,340 --> 00:38:05,140
my dear sweetenos um fell for me

619
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:53,340
Because I can't be around you and I'm not big with you

620
00:38:53,340 --> 00:39:04,340
If you refuse me to come with me, I'll go with you long

621
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:14,340
I'm waiting for day when I can't find a sleep

622
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:23,340
But if we blossom fair, my days we'd blossom fair

623
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:32,340
My days we blossom fair for me

624
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,340
Oh man, Robin Stein sweet blossom from her daydream CD

625
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,340
Played that on the source code a couple of times

626
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:47,340
One more thing about the audition, not only can anyone participate, but anyone who participate automatically wins

627
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:53,340
Because besides, I guess if you look at the steps in podcasting, there's really three steps

628
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:59,340
For a lot of you, I know because you're so passionate about what you do, the ultimate is to quit your day job

629
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,340
I think underneath that is G, I'd like to just make some money

630
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,340
Kind of like pod save music artists, you know, it'd be great if you had a hit

631
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,340
It's also nice if you can just get some rent money out of this

632
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,340
So I think that's a step that we can help a large number of podcasters with

633
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,340
Of course it doesn't involve advertising and sponsorship and doing business

634
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,340
But none of it will ever make you change what you do

635
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:31,340
That's kind of interesting, you know, all the shows that are now part of the pod show family

636
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:36,340
Just so you know there is an absolute rule as we have no say over the content

637
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:43,340
And it's explicitly stated that way, because I don't even want the opportunity to have the say over what's happening

638
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,340
And how many shows you want to make? I don't care, you do as many shows as you want

639
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,340
You know, you get rewarded based upon the audience size

640
00:40:51,340 --> 00:41:00,340
So it's anyway, so then you have one more level, I think that's a vast majority of people who may not even be interested in

641
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,340
In monetizing their podcast, but we're surely going to open it up for everybody

642
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:16,340
And that's just give me some great, reliable bandwidth, let me map my feed to a service that is going to stay up and is guaranteed to work

643
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:27,340
And one that is not necessarily, you know, a new project, you know, and just access bandwidth from somewhere

644
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:34,340
And you'll be hearing about this just around the same time you hear about all the details of the condition

645
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:43,340
Is that we have teamed up with some great, great companies to create the pod show podcast delivery network

646
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
And I'm very, very excited about it

647
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,340
Man, I'm telling you a lot on this Saturday morning, aren't I?

648
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:53,340
Well, maybe one more thing I wanted to talk about, audible announced a service yesterday for podcasters

649
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:02,340
And you remember a couple months ago, I was talking about the concept of what I call soft DRM, actually Ron calls it soft DRM

650
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:10,340
We all hate the DRM term, and the fact that through DRM has such a negative connotation

651
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Because when you say DRM, lots of people think, oh yeah, that's the stuff that, you know, that's from the people who accuse me of being a thief

652
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:25,340
And, and it's associated with not being able to copy and, yeah, basically not being able to rip something off

653
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:35,340
But there's a lot of major bonuses to having DRM, which is, for instance, getting a lot more information about your listeners

654
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:42,340
And being able to make your show a lot more interactive, understanding what people are and aren't tuning into

655
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:52,340
And I discussed this, well, we had a lot of, we've had a lot of ongoing conversations with the big digital rights management players

656
00:42:52,340 --> 00:43:03,340
And, you know, so I've always been kind of searching for an open type solution where we can use all the benefits, but kind of, you know, can get away from the negativity of DRM

657
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:08,340
And, you know, that I had several conversations with Don Kats from audible

658
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:16,340
Man, this is so unfortunate because he took parts of the right idea, but then he put it all behind the corporate firewall

659
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:21,340
And, and he's charging people to use his infrastructure and his service

660
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:27,340
And that, that is not the way that I think I did a bad job probably explaining to him

661
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,340
What, what we wrote, the power really can be

662
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:36,340
And now, if you do the math on it, it seems like you're actually, you wind up paying quite a lot of money

663
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:43,340
To, to deliver your, you know, to really get this information where there's a lot of this information

664
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:49,340
Yeah, we could have done it differently, that's all I know, but anyway, so we'll have to see how that plays out

665
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:56,340
I'm not seeing a lot of, I'm seeing a lot of confusion about it from, you know, from podcasts, we're trying to understand

666
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:03,340
Well, what exactly does this mean and I think that what they're all seeing is, hey, this means money out of my pocket again

667
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:09,340
So, we're trying to reverse all that, you know, if you want, if you want, great statistical analysis

668
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,340
I mean, some really good, useful stats

669
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:16,340
Then you're going to be happy when we start coming out with the, with the PDN

670
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,340
Speaking of happy

671
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,340
Nothing like a little intweign on the Saturday morning

672
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,340
There's an edge of change that we can't look back and see

673
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,340
And just what went wrong

674
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,340
I want to know now when we are

675
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,340
Should I pretend in a little face, babe

676
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,340
Yeah, I know when or what you've done

677
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:47,340
Could you confess your face with me

678
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:52,340
There's an edge of change that you told me and won't think

679
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,340
Suddenly change your mind

680
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,340
Isn't it strange that you'd come here for me

681
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,340
Turn away and leave me behind

682
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Now if he's like I'm drowning

683
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,340
If he's like I'm drowning away without you

684
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,340
I know the feeling

685
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,340
Cause I'll be a zombie for

686
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,340
I hope you don't feel just like me

687
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,340
I hope you don't feel just like me

688
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,340
I hope you don't feel just like me

689
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,340
I hope you don't like me

690
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:40,340
Isn't it strange that the world seems to turn away

691
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,340
When I try and explain

692
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:48,340
What's your strange that you can be as one

693
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,340
Yet another same

694
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,340
And if he's like I'm drowning

695
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,340
If he's like I'm drowning away without you

696
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,340
I know the feeling

697
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,340
Cause I'll be a zombie for

698
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,340
And if he's like I'm drowning

699
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,340
If he's like I'm drowning away without you

700
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,340
I hope you don't feel just like me

701
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,340
I hope you don't feel just like me

702
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,340
I hope you don't feel just like me

703
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,340
I hope you don't like me

704
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,340
Don't feel just like me

705
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,340
I hope you don't feel just like me

706
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,340
I hope you don't feel just like me

707
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:48,340
Would just lie me, I hope you'll I be

708
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,340
Love me, would just lie me

709
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,340
I hope you'll so feel just lie down

710
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,340
But I hope you'll feel much more

711
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:03,340
Baby, maybe not to I be

712
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,340
Not to I be

713
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,340
Not to I be

714
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,340
Not to I be

715
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:19,340
We'll go to my way

716
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,340
Not to I be

717
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,340
Not to I be

718
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,340
Not to I be

719
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:36,340
We'll go to my way

720
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,340
It'll Roger, an in time and happy on the daily source code

721
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,340
It is a

722
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,340
Let's see, it's a time for breakfast

723
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,340
What it is, one more comment I want to say about the podcast

724
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,340
Expo is that I think is really unfortunate

725
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,340
And somewhat strange that there is no channel out

726
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,340
This is not a blogging convention

727
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,340
So although there are lots of flicker photos

728
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,340
And there is a blogging going on, there's no audio

729
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,340
It's really strange

730
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,340
I would expect that it would have been made a lot more sense to stream

731
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,340
Some of the sessions or at least the key notes

732
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,340
That would have been great

733
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,340
Or create podcast

734
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,340
So I'm sure that they'll show up

735
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,340
Because people have obviously recorded these things

736
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,340
I just don't understand why

737
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:28,340
The brothers didn't think of making some of these things streaming

738
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,340
I think that's a great way to really hype up a conference

739
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,340
Anyway, it doesn't matter

740
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,340
Dude, we've done like a full show

741
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,340
Okay, I'm going to go have some breakfast

742
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,340
I might do a show tomorrow

743
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:46,340
Depending on what's happening and what time Doug K is flying back

744
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,340
I'm going to hit your right on the banana

745
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,340
So thanks for tuning in

746
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,340
