1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'll just share a journey, too, for you, save it.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And today is Tuesday, September 27th, in the year of our lure, 2,000 fans.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Warning, everybody, from hate to say it. Once again, sunny, California, sunny Northern California San Francisco.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's a great and beautiful day.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You know, it's true what they say. It never rains in California.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And not seeing it rain once since I've been here.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Funny, a fog, of course.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Alright, so time now is 9 a.m.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, it's nearly 1 for me.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But, you know, as I've said, I've got to keep it head of the eight ball being out on the west coast.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The Friday I'm going back home, then the shows will actually be there for you in the morning regardless of whether you're east coast or west coast.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Actually, even if you're in the UK, it'll be a general west in Europe at the end of the morning.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I've got my coffee ready, I've got my line up ready, we've got a hit test ready, we've got pot-safe music ready, we've got a new sponsor.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, I'm kind of cool stuff to talk about.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm just realizing something pretty interesting.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm looking out the window here at the condo at the Bank of America building.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you've been to San Francisco, you've probably seen this huge tower, well, it used to have the time on it for me, which I could look right across.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know, right out my kitchen window here, it's the time and the tower time has been off ever since I got here.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The first night it was on.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And I look kind of down and realize they're tearing the whole fucking tower down.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The wonder they turned the electricity off.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I guess it's going away.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
To the tower, all the doors, all the doors, all the doors.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, hopefully they'll put something up in his place that is nice to look at,

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
or if they take it down completely, I'll have an even clearer view of the marina.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Alright, kicking it off today with a mashup.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is one that artsen me just this morning, it's can't explain, but the mashup explains itself, check this out.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, now let's hear the number from your latest record.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We are setting out to achieve anything particular with this.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We were trying to achieve the sound which we get on the stage at present, you know.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Can't explain what's written to show what we're really trying to do, you know.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Alright, fine, what do you say about us now, would it?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And for the future.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Cause on the future you had to.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've got to credit call a seed.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's not mine, but it's okay.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't make it anything.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let your back, let your back, let it leave.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't do it, I'm not a bad thing to me.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's not mine, but it's okay.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't make it anything.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't do it, I'm not a bad thing to me.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've got to do it, I'm not a bad thing to me.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've got to go, you can't leave.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't do it, I'm not a bad thing to me.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But it's all ready.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And I've got to do it, I'm not a bad thing to me.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What you're in and where?

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Said it was going up free.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I've got to give both of you a good.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So I get to a dream,

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Show up on your car.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah!

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Better, okay.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't make it anything.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let your back, let it leave.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And don't do it, I'm not a bad thing to me.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,400
It's so good, but it's so good

63
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't want to be with you

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want to run too late

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,500
I don't want to be alone

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,000
And I don't want to be here

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Was it really what you're doing up like that?

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Time, time

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
See I'm moving on

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I'll repeat to turn back

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's so good, but it's so good

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't want to run too late

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Time, time

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
See I'm moving on

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't want to run too late

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That'll wake you up

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Races tower, rebooted by Smash

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Find it over at mashuptown.com

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Can't explain

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've had you in the minute

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I see

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Thank you gentlemen

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, those who boys in the beginning

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They were so naughty, weren't they?

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I was just looking through my blackberry

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's where I take notes

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
For stuff I want to remember to talk about on the show

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Which of course is not effective once you have 50,000 notes

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I saw a message coming from Devon, Austin, Dorf

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Adam, fear not, you are not a pussy

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I can't stand getting my blood drawn either

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Funny you should mention it because I'm sitting here with a band

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that jumped my arm for the very same reason

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Result of completing my physical and your emailing me

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The one thing I hate more

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
than getting my blood drawn is having my blood pressure

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know, this is funny you say that

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because although I of course know in my

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In my intellect

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Whatever's there of the intellect

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I know that it's funny blood pressure freaks me out a little bit too

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Ever had since I was a little kid

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The constricted feeling

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We got through it all, didn't we?

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yesterday had a great day at Apple

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Did not see my friend the frog and silicon valley

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
With his baguette barray and ipod

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But I did ask the folks who were meeting with

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You out of him, oh yeah, we know that dude

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Of course there's like eight million buildings over there

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So not really surprised that I didn't catch him

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Walking across the campus

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But we had a great update

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's really what it is

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We go over there once every couple of weeks and have an update

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We basically share some info

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Because they do have a lot of things that they're seeing

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
A lot of trends, they've hired a new guy, Pete

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Who is really responsible for the entire podcast

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's actually of the iTunes music store

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And he has a lot of really good ideas

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What he's really mainly is doing

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's trying to streamline a lot of these processes

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Of people getting into the Apple directory

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And I have to kind of reiterate one thing

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is Apple's directory

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So they're not going to put everything in it

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
They don't have to put anything in it

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They don't want to just like any potter.org

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I direct our directory and we put everything in it

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's completely their prerogative

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But there were a couple of things that came up in our talks

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Which are really interesting

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you're submitting your podcast to Apple

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Make sure that you have a description of your show

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In your RSS feed

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's really critical

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because believe it or not

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The people who take the submissions over there to Apple

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They look at the description in the feed

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They're not listening to all these shows

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Which you can imagine

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So if you've got a music show

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And you file onto the music category

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Which has been probably the biggest gripes so far

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
As that it just takes so long to get approved in the music category

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's probably because you didn't say

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Dude, this is what kind of songs I'm playing

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you're playing like RIA license music

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're not going to put that in your feed

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And they'll probably figure it out

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And they won't list you in the directory

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
However, if you're playing potsafe music

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Say it in the description of your feed

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And also if you want to be featured

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I think that they just post up out

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They think it's interesting

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And probably kind of the way I do it here at the daily source code

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You need to have a picture

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No art

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's a big one

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
People do not have art associated with their feed

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And because the whole iTunes podcast experience is also very visual

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It boos you to have art

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And it's funny because I don't like totally a green head nod

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And by the way Adam, you don't have any art for the daily source code

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And your feed

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Sorry about that

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And there was also some other minor thing that was wrong with the speck

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm getting the new speck

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Which I think was posted today or it will be posted today

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So there were some things going wrong just in the feed by itself

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No man

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Hold on a second

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let me just see who's calling

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't want to see who's calling me because I'm in the middle of a show

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Screw it

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But it looked like there might have been coming from home

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So I'll have to check it out in a minute

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So that was one of the big

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh wow factors over there

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And it makes sense

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You know I ask people this all the time

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Not just the metadata you're putting into your feed

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Which is critical

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I mean this is the stuff that propagates everywhere

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is how directories explain what's going on

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And you just show this is how you are automatically categorized

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But do that for your MP3 files as well

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Please

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Especially if you send off a promo

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It really helps because you know

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You have programs like I'm using MegaSeg

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But you have programs like Cast Blaster

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You have programs that even I tune

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It pulls information out of the ID3 tags of a file

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And displays it and that really facilitate

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And getting the information out

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So that was a big one

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We talked about some other fantastic opportunities

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Which

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I got a voice mail

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll tell you what

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Let me play pod safe tune for you here for a second

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I thought you didn't need to be woken up

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I only got checkers of voice mail see what's going on

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This is Lee 3 Harris

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Nothing to believe in

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Pick it up on the pod safe music network for this reason check it out

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I am TV and Vids 1

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And I'm a little planet in Nickelodeon

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And a net and a satellite dish and a

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Big tanker Dr. Fish and a

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You don't have this word you whisper

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Nothing to believe in

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Nothing to believe in

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Got a pretty good friend and a big new car

219
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Everybody knows your name at the bar

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
All the design is sneakers

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Terry O'Wit and she's speakers

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We don't have just what you deserve

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Nothing to believe in

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Nothing to believe in

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Right to his right

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
When you say you're so old

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Nothing more to silver go

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
When you know no matter not as the pain in

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Then ain't gonna save you ain't gonna save you

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Bucks and hooks upon the shell

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Down on the corner there's a taco bell

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Big max and two one sticks

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And hot but stunned is and milkshakes

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Nothing has just what it takes

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Nothing to believe in

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Nothing to believe in

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Nothing to believe in

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Nothing to believe in

239
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Nothing to believe in

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
From the pod save music network

241
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Check it out at music.podshow.com

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
More about that later on when

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
CC checks in

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
CC Chapman from accident hash

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So I check the voice mail the phone call

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Was funny

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I kind of I'm happy I didn't pick up

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Because I want to talk to these guys

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But I want to take some time

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It was the guy from the

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Wiki base

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That was the the Wiki that we had

253
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Over the weekend that was so

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Rockin and then kind of fell apart

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Using it for show notes for the

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Daily source code so of course

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Exactly what I expected

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What happened is we had multiple people

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Working on Wiki show notes and there's

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Another one which I put I actually

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Linked yesterday show to that other

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Wiki which Michael has been putting up

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Man

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I mean that we'll talk about your

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Detailed show notes and footnotes

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And correction notes and

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Whoa that was really nice of course

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I think he's doing most of the work

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And the question is can we really

270
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Keep it an open community

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wiki or do people come in and mess around

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
with it and I got to talk to these guys

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
About the the Wiki base

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Whatever it is they are

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
To see if that you know what what happened

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
With the Wiki did it get taken down

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Was it hacked the people mess with it

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Is it not robust enough and these are all all questions

279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's probably

280
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know I mean it would be nice if you

281
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Can have some kind of permissions or something

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sure it has permissions in there

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But I just got to figure out what the permissions are

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's got to be really simple

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And I just like the whole idea of if you show up

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's the show notes and oh man

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You know I want to add something

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But still you got to kind of have someone

289
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Keep it an eye on it because you know

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Somebody can really come in and mess it up

291
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And you know

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There you go well have to kind of see how that works

293
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
As a community project

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm still very excited about it by the way

295
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It really it really kicks ass

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And these I've never had show notes like this

297
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So check that out

298
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's it's linked from yes

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There's also linked to today's source code

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll link to those show notes

301
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And we'll see how Michael does on that

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Maybe he can start giving us a little bit of feedback

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
As to how we can you know open this up to a wide

304
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The community participatory event

305
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You know what I mean

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let's see

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What else did I have here

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I got a couple of things

309
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, here's something really sucked

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So yesterday I come back to the condo

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And I can't find three com anymore

312
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I mean this is

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And for those of you who've been listening

314
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Three com is the of course the three com is a device name

315
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But there's been an open

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Wi-Fi network

317
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Am I building called three com that's just been nice and powerful

318
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I've been able to sit in at least four different locations in the condo and use it

319
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's gone

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So all that was left now

321
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let me see I have Benbo 7

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And Benbo 7 is not strong enough to make it

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Actually is the only one spot that it works in the entire place

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And it's kind of like on the couch and I have to turn it just so so I can get two bars on the airport reading

325
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If I had an airport antenna and external antenna

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sure I do much better or even if I had the

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I didn't bring the

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The crap with me that does really well on Wi-Fi reception

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So I kind of like had to prepare for the show last night

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
In you know I've contorted in all different

331
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
All different directions just to be able to get the Wi-Fi signal

332
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So I guess I'm going to have to break down and actually have to go and

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Call the cable or the 80s

334
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
80s

335
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah those guys

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh it's we're talking to the people

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We're talking to the people

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't you want to say hello to the people

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah, how can you say podcast

340
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Dang those reds are podcasting again

341
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Almost live from Kirkland Washington

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a bread abroad with Steve Lacy

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hi, this is Steve Lacy from my bread abroad

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And the builders were fast here

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh, do you know what they don't do tea breaks?

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What they do back home?

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, it's just down there

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Back to Montana

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Montana was grand

350
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Sure, as I was the first time it was kind of similar

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I was like there were guys with like a couple of cowboy hats on and I was like

352
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They get to wear them because they're actually cowboys

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, they're not front and because it's like

354
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't hold for American companies doing business in the UK

355
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, she she could just do PR for me in a really small skirt

356
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The fun now

357
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You are listening to a bread abroad

358
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is British and he's not in Britain

359
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That that's why he's a good name

360
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So come and join this Englishman living in the Pacific Northwest of these United States

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
As I rant, rave, wax, lyrical, and place some fine music

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You can find my blog on the web and subscribe to the show at www.steve-lacy.com

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And don't forget you can find this and on a fine British podcast at www.brickaster.com

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
See ya!

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Pod Show

366
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother

367
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hello, Adam, it's me, Mad Weinstein, your favorite lesbian from the internet

368
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And the pod shows

369
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I have a wonderful, wonderful, exciting announcement for you

370
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And for all of the podcast turds out there

371
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
CubeHodder.org

372
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The exclusive not exclusive

373
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about

374
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The gay and lesbian podcasting community

375
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Which is of course open to anybody

376
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You don't have to be gay, lesbian, transvestite, transvestite

377
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Or a wander wisdom to join

378
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
In fact, our own PW Fenton is a member

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Even though he's not well, he's a male lesbian

380
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Anyway, we just reached our 100th podcast turd

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Our 100th queer podcast turd

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
On the CubeHodder

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And I'm so excited because just a couple of months ago

384
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
When iTunes was released, there were only 13

385
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
CubeHodcasters

386
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And now we have over 100

387
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And we've got 300 members including listeners, fans and contributors

388
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So I'm very excited, Adam

389
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And now, what does this mean for pod show

390
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And the community in general?

391
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, but it's why didn't you tell me Adam

392
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But I have an idea, why don't we start?

393
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, maybe it's your idea, I don't know

394
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But maybe we can give up some free hosting

395
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Away to the CubeHodders

396
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And then they can work with us

397
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Provide advertising for them

398
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then they get money, we all get money, we all get happy

399
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know if that didn't make any sense

400
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You can cut that out, I don't fucking know

401
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm a lesbian

402
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Anyway, thank you, Adam

403
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
For all you support on this pod show

404
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's been a dreams come true for me

405
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And I know that the other pod cast

406
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Herds out there are just as excited

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
To make money doing what they enjoy

408
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Doing

409
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And I hope we can make this happen for them

410
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And I know that we can get some common

411
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Manufacturers to advertise some of these

412
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Boo's, manufacturers, these Kenneth Coles

413
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Type of companies, computers, whatever

414
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You know, we're here, we're queer, we ask

415
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We tell QPOTA.org

416
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And this is Madge Weinstein

417
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
From yeast radio, you have favorite lesbian

418
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
In the bloatosphere

419
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Have a nice yeast infection everybody

420
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
On yeast radio

421
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Madge, that's an entrepreneur

422
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Sorry, I can already tell from my equipment readout

423
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Here that we had a skip during a

424
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Just a little diatribe there

425
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's because God, I hate this

426
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Ever since I installed Tiger

427
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm sure there's a way to turn it off

428
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But of course, I keep forgetting to do it

429
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The dot mac, icing just kicks in

430
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And of course, since I don't

431
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm not able to reach a network here

432
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's trying to mount my eye disk

433
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And it freezes the finder

434
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And then all kinds of bad stuff happens

435
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But I think Madge, fantastic

436
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You blew me away with it with that

437
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I totally totally, they've over 100

438
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Podcast in the QPOTA.org directory

439
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Which of course is also linked

440
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
From the indie potter.org directory

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
This is the cool thing

442
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Where you can have subcategories

443
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That are created somewhere

444
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Completely different and still link into the same place

445
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That really is pure genius of that system

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But talking about advertisers

447
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is something that we've been working on

448
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Very hard here at Pod Show

449
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I came up with what I thought was a perfect idea

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I've really been trying to hit it on the show

451
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But I got a big, a big no from the Pod Show

452
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Sail staff yesterday

453
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Although I still think they should try it

454
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Volkswagen has been very interested in advertising on Podcast

455
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And I kept, I had to test that

456
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We're on a way to Apple with Chris

457
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And I'm saying Chris, dude

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Get me a Volkswagen

459
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And we'll do a couple things with it

460
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We'll broadcast from it

461
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But also we'll do my biodiesel experiments on it

462
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That was the part that he had kind of a reason

463
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't know how I'm going to pitch that

464
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
To tell him man, it'll be the coolest thing ever

465
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Everyone's going to be buying these Volkswagen

466
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And crapping in their tank to make it run

467
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm telling you this is going to be a revolution

468
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So I don't know

469
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I mean that's usually how it goes

470
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Then we have to go through the agency

471
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And the agency has to go to the client

472
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So I wonder how revolutionary the agencies are

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's just a thought

474
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So we have been looking to a whole bunch of other advertisers

475
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And sponsors really

476
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And it's cool when you get a sponsor

477
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Because sponsors usually want you to talk about a certain product

478
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And that's really easy to do if you'd like the product

479
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So yesterday I was given product to take home the test with

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And even though we're not even starting the promotion

481
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I want to, you know, first of all

482
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You got an iPod, maybe you're listening to this on an iPod

483
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Or another MP3 player

484
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Look at that iPod for a second

485
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Now imagine

486
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Just hold that and you hold it in your hand if you will

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Now imagine that

488
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Out of each side of the iPod

489
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Something started to grow

490
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Towards the right and towards the left

491
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Hmm, 50

492
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Great, I've programmed you yet again

493
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It is the MM50

494
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
From a logic tech

495
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What the hell is it?

496
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Well it's something that I never would have bought myself

497
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Because you know

498
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I've seen these things laying around

499
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You know, docking stations for your iPod

500
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Because that's what this is

501
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But this one really blew me away

502
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
First of all

503
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It works with both iPods and with other MP3 players

504
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So that's really styled for the iPod

505
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But you can plug in an external source

506
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Just a mini jack

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So I actually had it hooked up to my computer last night

508
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And I don't know what these guys do

509
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Do it logic tech or how they do it

510
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And what are they from different like Switzerland I think?

511
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, I've actually visited them before in Switzerland

512
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But the sound that comes here the whole second

513
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let me just it has a little remote control

514
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You see which is very very nice

515
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The sound that comes out of this thing is just unbelievable

516
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Let me see

517
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Are we on here?

518
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Hold on

519
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There we go

520
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Wait, that's not what I want to see

521
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Now this

522
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't want that

523
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Okay, this is from my iPod

524
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Listen to that man

525
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This is based tone

526
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
She all turned the mic a bit

527
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The sound is unbelievable

528
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This is exactly what I've been looking for here at the condo

529
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Because I didn't want to put a huge stereo system in place

530
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You know it's like all kinds of wires and shit

531
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And I'm not going to use it anyway

532
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Because everything I have comes off of the

533
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Computer or off of the iPod

534
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So this thing has a

535
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
A plug so you can connect it to your computer

536
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So we just drop your iPod in it syncs automatically

537
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And here's the thing that really blew me away

538
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It has a little case and it has fold out feet and everything

539
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But it's really sturdy it's not like a some plastic job

540
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I wanted to take it into the bathroom last night as I was preparing for bed

541
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And so I'm already to take the adapter with me and then you know move it over

542
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And I unplug it and it keeps on playing

543
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So when you have it plugged into it has a nice little white wall adapter

544
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This used to be

545
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
When you have it plugged in

546
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It charges the iPod but it also charges

547
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Maybe it's running on the iPod battery

548
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't know but it ran for a real long time last night

549
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And I'm very very impressed

550
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
This is the thing by the way that I've been looking for

551
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
For the shows that Ron and I do

552
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And we talked to advertisers and marketers

553
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because we always have to plug into

554
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We always have to plug into the house system

555
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
In someone's media room and sometimes well know

556
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'd say most of the time

557
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The sound really sucks and you can't control it

558
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So now I'm just going to put this thing on the fricking desk

559
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's loud enough to blow up a whole room full of sounds

560
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So it's very cool

561
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's the MM50

562
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
From from Logitech

563
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Soon to be a sponsor of

564
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The pod show podcast

565
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm at CCH1 to drop you a quick note

566
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Because I heard you talking about the pod show

567
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Music rewind show today

568
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You and your listeners a quick update on what it is

569
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Pod show music rewind is hosted

570
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And produced by Marcus Couch of the scenes

571
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Check it out at buscinesine.com

572
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Great pod cast in a proud member of the pod show music game

573
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Anyways, what we wanted to do and what Marcus came up with for the idea

574
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Was you know to kind of highlight all the different

575
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Seven music shows that are signed to pod show

576
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm giving people a flavor of what each of them is like

577
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So every week we're going to a recap

578
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Playback clip from each show

579
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Every week what we're doing is each pod gastric

580
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Gives Marcus a clip of a song and an intro

581
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
All that from the pet previous week

582
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
A record something brand new and gives it to him

583
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Then he puts it all together and puts it out every week

584
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And for those listeners you want to check it out

585
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Surf on over to pod show music rewind.com

586
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
We're going to be it's it's it's in beta guys

587
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Working it all set up getting all the servers and everything set up

588
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But there's both a regular feed and an enhanced feed

589
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So you can subscribe to either one

590
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You know the hands has all the cover art

591
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The album art the links all that jazz

592
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But we realize not everybody can

593
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Support enhanced pod cast

594
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So we put out a regular one as well

595
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And we put we submitted the listen to iTunes

596
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But we all know how that goes so hopefully it'll be there soon

597
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And so check it out and kudos to Marcus couch

598
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He kicked ass and really stepped it to the plate

599
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And knocked this one out of the park

600
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So Adam glad you're enjoying the show

601
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And the seven-headed monster will be that can do that

602
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
He's out guys totally rock do it

603
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I really like listening to that last night

604
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
By the way CC make sure you got in the description of the feed

605
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Saying that it's all pod safe music

606
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That'll help with getting it listed in iTunes as we now know

607
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Rolling this out off the pod safe music network

608
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's a good example of no ID three tags fly highs

609
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
What I see right here. I like it kind of a reggae vibe

610
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
What we need love

611
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Beyond my kind why they know what we're going to get

612
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Why they know what we make

613
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
No Jedi why they want

614
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Keep it shoulder later that's where we are

615
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Be keep on post-selling

616
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Not fight

617
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Maybe I need to

618
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll be ignited

619
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
To the open up the plan

620
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Make your hear from the make it go down

621
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Drain the vibe with room in

622
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
To put it in your brand

623
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Good know

624
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
To the sister

625
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
She must feel

626
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah

627
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah

628
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah

629
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,560
I'll proud

630
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,000
That.

631
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,120
drought and

632
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,360
What the

633
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:39,920
2.

634
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,340
Made a fool myself, it's a stumbling long

635
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,140
Like if you'd like to lose you to throw up a song

636
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,820
All I did was finish think about the freaking extra

637
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,380
Spending 80% in dollars every day of the week

638
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,940
It was our deal, some trouble

639
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,140
Shampoo, we won't

640
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,820
Shampoo in the corner, yeah, you know

641
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,220
The really was no other

642
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,700
It made me feel better, any time and any weather

643
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,820
I was an angry man drunk and I didn't know no better yet

644
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,460
I didn't mean to do it, but I still think it was suited

645
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,020
Yellow and ma'am, I could only like a Puerto Rican moon kid

646
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,500
No, hold on, go on now

647
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,980
Est on the Westoma, I'm not the same person

648
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,700
No, hold on, he's not the one I've been

649
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,980
He's a lost track of what was those days

650
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,660
But now I'm blind, high, cause my ramen paid

651
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,520
Like, right

652
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,000
You can't stop what you got

653
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,500
When it takes I've ready for it

654
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
They like it, you did, ma'am, I lost me

655
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Stay a cool bar, and then you can't stop it

656
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Reyes, open your leg, live from from my beloved

657
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,500
Me, they've been through the alley, but they can't catch me

658
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Them can't see me, me, I'm a scar

659
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
And me, T-B, we fit that line, you won't need a shine

660
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
No player here, sure

661
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Then step into the next, let me shine a fly

662
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
We're young, fit fly

663
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
We're slim, for your end, to the sky

664
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
We're the young partner, earth

665
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Our only fit up, minutes, little hell

666
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Make your feel, more minutes, away

667
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,480
I'll pick it, wind it, settle a bit

668
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,540
Drink the Bibleыш, mark ya neverstanden

669
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,480
Have an old dictionary, make a Away

670
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Nadaie famous, Salme P Filmet,nie, it's Tebot Your Life

671
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Come on, take their backs, come on, we're Turder things out

672
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Set then them our black, damn our home

673
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
A win with you, I love it, bye

674
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,500
Time, our memories are your night

675
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,000
Ye, you, United

676
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,660
Bye, I live, T'you

677
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,640
I touch when it Essa

678
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,420
Now we're back, we're ramen pay

679
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:50,380
I've been to Jamaica about 17, 18, 19 times of vacation, started off with a documentary

680
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,980
I did once with a good Jamaican, I loved it so much that we just kept on going back

681
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
on vacation.

682
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,980
I love it.

683
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,980
I love it.

684
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
I love it.

685
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,260
I haven't been in a couple of years and it's time to go again.

686
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,940
We always go to a place called Round Hill, which is just fantastic.

687
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,500
It's great because you can go there for 20 years and the same staff is there and they all

688
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,500
remember you and I've become good friends with some of the staff over there.

689
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,340
If you go to, I'm not really like, I'll leave their stay in the house because these are great

690
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,900
houses that other people own that you can basically rent for a week or so.

691
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,940
They're fully furnished and you come with the staff with three, three people staff and it's

692
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,940
really nice.

693
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,100
But if I'm not hanging out with them, then I'd like to go into town but hang out with

694
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:42,860
the locals and some of the guys who worked out the beach and I teach them how to do stuff

695
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,620
on the internet and they teach me other important things in life.

696
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:57,780
And I've been to a dance hall a couple of times actually and so you hear the DJ of

697
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,300
the sound system.

698
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
What am I here?

699
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Oh, is that the MM50? Is that still on hold on?

700
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Yeah.

701
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,300
That would not read a Hayworth music.

702
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,300
I should be joining the Q-botters.

703
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:22,300
So the toaster or the DJ from the sound system will invariably say, LITA!

704
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:28,300
And you can actually buy these plastic disposable big lighters and they turn them up.

705
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,300
As far as they can go, in fact they rip the metal off and turn them and you know, so

706
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:38,300
that we can push the flame level even higher and they just blast these flames into the

707
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,300
air and sometimes they bring along aerosol cans and spray aerosol and ignite that.

708
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,300
And that's the whole bit of LITA!

709
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
So good news.

710
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Well, funny news actually. I finally got a hold of the trucking company, JC Penny.

711
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
So here's what happened.

712
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,300
I never really told you the whole story, but I really got into it with JC Penny.

713
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,300
And they had said, if you don't hear anything by Tuesday because the shipping company has

714
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,300
14 working days since the, since it was invoice, that was August 28th.

715
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,300
That was two weeks after we freaking ordered.

716
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,300
They have 14 days to call you for an appointment.

717
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,300
So by Thursday last week, I'm like, excuse me.

718
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,300
They haven't called yet.

719
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:27,300
And you know, so then it took like 15 minutes and then the person came back.

720
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
I called customer service, JC Penny.

721
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Well, here's the number of the shipping company.

722
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
You got to go call them and make an appointment.

723
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
I'm like, whoa, that's not going to cut it.

724
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,300
You know, I'm your customer.

725
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
I'm not the shipping company's customer.

726
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
You got to take care of me.

727
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
And just, you know, well, yeah, we can't help us.

728
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
Look, give me a supervisor.

729
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,300
I just want to talk to somebody.

730
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
So I got a supervisor on the phone.

731
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:53,300
And I said, look, you know, if I had known that I had to eventually call the shipping company myself, you should have emailed me that information.

732
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Email me the name and number of the shipping company.

733
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Well, yeah, I know, but, you know, she just wouldn't understand that I was not complaint.

734
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,300
Well, I was pissed off that I've been waiting so long for this stuff.

735
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,300
But at least tell, you know, send me some information through email.

736
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,300
Let me know when you complete your order.

737
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Tell me what the process is going to be and that this is how it's going to go.

738
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,300
That basically I have to call up the shipping company to order something to make sure it's delivered or that it can just get stuck.

739
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
And it just went on and on and on.

740
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,300
I said, look, please, just put in a little tag next to my name in the database.

741
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
Have someone call me.

742
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
I'll tell them how they can make their business much better.

743
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,300
And then she said in the legendary words, I'm just a small person.

744
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,300
There really be a company.

745
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
I don't think I can help you with that.

746
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,300
And I said, well, I'm sorry.

747
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Then I can't be your customer anymore.

748
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,300
And I finally called the shipping company yesterday.

749
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Yesterday.

750
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
They had a freaking with JC penny shipping.

751
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
Like they're a part of it.

752
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,300
You know, JC penny is pretending like they're an independent company, which I'm sure they are.

753
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Maybe this phone line just flashes and so with JC penny.

754
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
So they'll call me Wednesday.

755
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,300
They'll call me tomorrow to let me know what time they're going to deliver on Thursday.

756
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Which, of course, is the day before I go, which means it's going to be this mad dash of unpacking shit and putting the bed together.

757
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Ron is promised to come over.

758
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
He says he says he's good at that.

759
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I've never seen him hang anything, put anything together.

760
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
I've seen him design stuff.

761
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
He's really good at that.

762
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,300
But I've never seen him actually with a screwdriver or a hammer or a wrench for that matter.

763
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
So that'll be interesting.

764
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,300
That's a sound seeing experiment right there.

765
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
Tell you.

766
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
So anyway, so that's kind of taken care of the day before I leave.

767
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,300
But I guess I'll be back in two and a half weeks and we'll be back here in the condo because it's just really heating up.

768
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Also, I figured out that, you know, now that I know that I kind of live here in San Francisco,

769
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,300
three blocks from anywhere.

770
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
And there's a big block.

771
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,300
And you've got to walk under highways and pass bus stations before you get to a Starbucks.

772
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,300
Which, I don't mind that much in a year or two.

773
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,300
This will be a very bustling hustling community up here because they are really building.

774
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,300
After they got that Bank of America building torn down.

775
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,300
And so I, of course, I went to the best place for advice.

776
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,300
I went to the, you know, the dormant.

777
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,300
Mario.

778
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
And Mario, he switched on.

779
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,300
He knows what podcast things about.

780
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
He's a musician.

781
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
He's, he's, he's totally into it.

782
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,300
He's into the podcast music scene.

783
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,300
He says, hey, man, why don't you just order from Safeway?

784
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
What, they deliver?

785
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Yeah.

786
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
So popped on Safeway.com.

787
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,300
And, you know, he just go through the entire store shop by aisle.

788
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,300
It was, you know, we've heard about these things and they do exist in places.

789
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,300
But here it actually does exist and does work, I guess.

790
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,300
So today between 4 and 6 p.m.

791
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
I have to be back.

792
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Otherwise, it would have had to wait until tomorrow.

793
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,300
But I need so many different things just to survive here.

794
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
So I didn't put like a $250 order.

795
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,300
So they're going to deliver that today, including mobs and brooms and all kinds of stuff.

796
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,300
So, hey, yo, long live the internet.

797
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,300
What is comedy forecast?

798
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,300
It's a comedy podcast in four minutes or less.

799
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Is it a rant?

800
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Sometimes.

801
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,300
It's like those waitresses who ask you how your meal is while your mouth is full.

802
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
I'm sure they do it on purpose.

803
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Is it a parody?

804
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Occasionally.

805
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,300
Oh, there.

806
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
This is Paul Land.

807
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,300
And this is four minutes with Paul.

808
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Is it funny?

809
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Oh, I hope so.

810
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
Well, when I think we need to upgrade our computer.

811
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
What's wrong with the computer?

812
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Well, the cassette drive doesn't work anymore.

813
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,300
And it's getting really hard to find pin-feed paper for the dot matrix printer.

814
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,300
But I love that Commodore 64.

815
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Yes, I know.

816
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,300
You can check us out at our website, comedy4cast.com.

817
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,300
And that's with the number four.

818
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Okay?

819
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
We're done, done, done, done.

820
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
Bye-bye.

821
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:52,300
The motor tools went forth and cast their pods in the direction of all who would listen.

822
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:57,300
And casting their pods in this manner, they were henceforth known as podcasters.

823
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,300
We're getting your ear.

824
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,300
I've got you podcast right here.

825
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Hello.

826
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,300
This is Doug K.

827
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,300
The Executive Producer of IT Conversations.

828
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,300
Poptech 2004 was arguably the most popular event ever published on IT conversations.

829
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,300
And this year's Poptech held in Camden Main October 19th through 22nd looks like it's going to be even better.

830
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Well, have I got a deal for you?

831
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,300
For the extraordinary cooperation of the folks at Poptech and Limelight Networks,

832
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,300
we're going to be broadcasting a free live audio stream of the entire Poptech event.

833
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,300
That's right.

834
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,300
I'm going to be getting up at 5 o'clock Pacific Time every day,

835
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:52,300
dragging my butt into Studio 2 to host the program via the remote ISDN feed from the Camden Opera House.

836
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
But wait, there's more.

837
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,300
During the breaks, we'll bring you the greatest music of all types from the podsafe music network.

838
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Hosted by the various musical hosts of the Podshow music shows,

839
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,300
including the host of accidental hash and the manager of podsafe music network CC Chapin.

840
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,300
So mark the dates October 19th through 22nd on your calendar.

841
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,300
Check IT Conversations.com for the schedule.

842
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,300
And thanks for listening.

843
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Doug K. Man, he's got it together.

844
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,300
He's got a great network, IT Conversations.com.

845
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:33,300
And the way he does it, and it's a non-profit organization that he's put together with just tons of volunteers.

846
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,300
And people willing to really capture this audio.

847
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,300
All these great minds and great speakers and great events.

848
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,300
Poptech, of course, is also, I guess, kind of an open source type of event.

849
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,300
But it's a bitch to get to, it's held up in what Camden main is that it?

850
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,300
So really exciting this year is that during the breaks in the live feeds,

851
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,300
we'll have the podsafe music network gang rolling out podsafe music.

852
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,300
So this is great, man. We're really doing it.

853
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,300
We are creating an entire new universe without any help from the outside.

854
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,300
But, of course, I have to admit, I do miss my non-podsafe music once in a while.

855
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
Yon, help me out.

856
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,300
I've been one girl in casting with Adam Curry.

857
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,300
I suppose you think you know me or me.

858
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,300
So yeah, what did you add?

859
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
The hit test.

860
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,300
Yon, Polet.

861
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,300
Come on, Yon, Polet.

862
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,300
Try as me, baby.

863
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,300
Hey, Adam, this is hit test number 61, it's Tuesday morning.

864
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,300
And I just get out of bed, so my voice is still a bit low.

865
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,300
I get to.

866
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
Can be an advantage, of course.

867
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,300
I wanted to let you know that I updated the hit test track listing page.

868
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
I added a lot of iTunes links.

869
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Oh, cool.

870
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,300
So if anyone was going to buy tracks from the hit test and would use my links,

871
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,300
I would appreciate it very much.

872
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Yeah.

873
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,300
Okay, three intros and three answers and this is number one.

874
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Oh, man.

875
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,300
I give up.

876
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
And this is number two.

877
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Robert Palmer, can we still be friends?

878
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
At least I got one.

879
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,300
And the final one is always number three.

880
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
Oh.

881
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,300
Oh.

882
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,300
It's a lovely thing to do.

883
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
I think that's what it is.

884
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,300
Okay, I know number two for sure.

885
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,300
I'm not sure about three and one is tough.

886
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,300
And times up and this is answer number one.

887
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,300
It's a song from 1984.

888
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,300
This is Stinssel Town in the rain.

889
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,300
To the Nile.

890
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,300
But every ever comes so far.

891
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
Yeah.

892
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
We're not a goddamn one.

893
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,300
I give up.

894
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,300
I've seen it all before.

895
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,300
I know that.

896
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Love was so exciting.

897
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,300
Tinssel Town and Lorraine.

898
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,300
Oh, man.

899
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,300
I'm not.

900
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Here we are.

901
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,300
I've been this way.

902
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Tinssel Town in the rain.

903
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Answer number one.

904
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
And this is answer number two.

905
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
Let's Robert Palmer.

906
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,300
This is can we still be friends?

907
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,300
I love this song.

908
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,300
We can play this game any moment.

909
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Can we still be friends?

910
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:51,300
Things just can't go on like before.

911
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,300
Can we still be friends?

912
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,300
Madam Missing.

913
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,300
We have so much to learn.

914
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,300
Now it's time for the winter time.

915
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,300
We're going to the winter time.

916
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,300
We're going to the winter time.

917
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,300
We're going to the winter time.

918
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:25,300
We're going to the winter time.

919
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,300
Robert Palmer has answered number two.

920
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,300
And can we still be friends?

921
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,300
We're going to the situation I'm in right now.

922
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,300
And that's because I'm going through a divorce.

923
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
Answer number three.

924
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
I was right.

925
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:55,300
It's a love thing.

926
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
Answer number three.

927
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,300
Man, I love music.

928
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,300
And I really love these music.

929
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,300
Expect a lot of it in the coming hit test.

930
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,300
Okay, this concludes hit test number 61.

931
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,300
It's Tuesday, September 27th.

932
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,300
And of course, I hope it'll be played soon.

933
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,300
Adam in your daddy's source code.

934
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,300
I hope you did well.

935
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,300
I hope you enjoyed this one.

936
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,300
Two out of three.

937
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,300
Always.

938
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,300
Feedback is welcome at hittest.gmail.com.

939
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,300
And you can find all sorts of info on my blog.

940
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Yampolet.com.

941
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,300
J-A-N-P-O-L-E-T.com.

942
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,300
And as I said earlier, there is a page with all the tracks in the hittest.

943
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,300
And now I edit almost all iTunes links.

944
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,300
So if you're going to buy a track from the hittest,

945
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,300
please do it using my iTunes links.

946
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,300
Well, thank you for listening to you for the next one.

947
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,300
Hopefully tomorrow, so until then, bye-bye.

948
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,300
Notice I'll single guys have a much higher output.

949
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,300
Yeah, and I'm sorry you're going through all that, and that sucks.

950
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,300
I don't really does bike.

951
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,300
I head on over to hittest.com or hittest.nl,

952
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,300
so that you can find out more about the tracks played in the hittest

953
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,300
and actually go purchase them.

954
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,300
Nothing we talked about at Apple yesterday.

955
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,300
I reiterated I said, dude, come on.

956
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,300
This is perfect two years.

957
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,300
I wish there was a G5 or some other model that I could...

958
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,300
I would have upgraded a long time ago, but there is no upgrade.

959
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,300
This is the biggest one you can get.

960
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,300
You know, the fastest.

961
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,300
I think it has the fastest processor,

962
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,300
but I think it's just it's had it, man.

963
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,300
The mouse, the trackpad, doesn't work anymore,

964
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,300
and I've been through a million,

965
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,300
I've been through this for like a year,

966
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,300
where the trackpad will also go screw me on

967
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,300
and then you have to reset your P-RAM

968
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
and do all this stuff and shake it like an etchist.

969
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
Another pop show podcast.

970
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
Stick it in your ear.

971
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
Thanks for watching.
