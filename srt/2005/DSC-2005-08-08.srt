1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta Sarah Charlie two two one ladies and gentlemen. The pod father is down. May they made it. The pod father is down. I repeat the pod father is down

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Okay, well now you have the attention over you. All right ladies and gentlemen as you all know we are in the big NYC

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Represent if you didn't hear that I did do the chest banging thing. Yes, we have the official represent sign

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,500
So as you all probably heard on the on the weblog my dad does have the flu and it is beyond sucking it now officially

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
So

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,500
The flight the flight was actually amazing. We had first class, so I'm just gonna do the briefing here on the

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,500
On how the vacation is going first class. We all sat in one of those little pods. You know you're like little

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Closed off little thing with a little foot rest. You got your little pimped TV. It's just like pimped my right episode on the airplane

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,000
So we all sat a bar like a playboy sort of thing going on as some flight tendons with a short skirt to give you massages

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Especially it's like a cheap version of my high clock

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
It's really good

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Oh

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,500
There was one of the little beeless celebrities Johnny von no it's not as good any crane

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Johnny von is a radio show host in England and he thinks a lot of himself

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,500
He's pretty much a dick. We were on the airplane and we see him sitting there moms. Oh, I know who he is

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,500
He's a mom celebrity spotted. Oh, he's he's from the commercial at all. Oh, oh, the one for dancing in the street

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
I can't sing it right now, but he's a DJ

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
So

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,500
You know just after getting a few foul looks from the whole time, you know just giving us the eye because we're speaking in

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Language she's like once was going on here. I'm cool. I'm English. I understand what they're saying

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
So

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Dad just sits are like

23
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Smash his head

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Oh, blatantly and then mom says oh hi

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,500
No, but you were like you didn't you didn't like him. He was loud

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,500
He wasn't used to get into the night. Let me just explain that this all this jockeys all this jockeys

27
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Are clinging to the lowest rung of the showbiz ladder

28
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:31,000
And that's why they and they're always hyper particularly morning guys because that's the life and they're always like jittery and jumping around like they've got to read

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Yeah, it's like me

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
If you want to join in, you got to come we'll show you come over to you

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I think you have some good stuff to say mom's got some good stuff to say about the flight. Come on. How are you feeling, huh?

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Grab a chair, babe

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
You're still sick

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,500
So actually Christina was the only one who was normal you felt yeah, you felt good

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,500
But we think mom and dad think that you remember we went to you remember it was less week

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,500
We went to the playboy party party and partying and it was very very hot

37
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
It was hot. I don't mean like

38
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,500
No hot because it was cool sexy hot was like it was stinking hot and sweaty and muggy and and

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
That people everyone

40
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
No

41
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
People were sweating a lot and talking with

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
We say with consumption

43
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Spring on you

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
To get really close to here

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Now English people are people who love to drink

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
That's what you don't you don't say

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Yeah, so we think that that happens it happened over there

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Oh definitely someone had some germs and then this germs jumped on me

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
And they may have jumped on you

50
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
But you have a different flu you don't have it as bad

51
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Now you have a flu and I have just a heavy cold

52
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
We're coughing and we're waking up in the middle of the night

53
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
It's looking at each other

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Rogitason

55
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Nice

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Because we took Nike

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
And Nike actually

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Getting sleep

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
You don't know anything until four o'clock

60
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Then you start to cough again

61
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
You have to grab some other drugs probably

62
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
In fact, we had so much Nike

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I had a insurance test for tomorrow morning

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,580
tomorrow morning. I cancel that because I think I'm a crystal meth addict. No, because you're

65
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,220
happy for me. If I look at your arms. I'm totally stone from this shit. Yeah, they are very

66
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:02,820
big. The people's are very dilated. And that's a stuff that's in there. So, Adam, it doesn't

67
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,780
not a very good start to the vacation. No, I'm sorry. Christina and I. But my voice does sound

68
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,740
really fucking cool now, doesn't it? In a world where less beings are nothing but women who

69
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,380
were comfortable shoes. The big hell. The less humans are nothing more than the big hell. Nothing more

70
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:26,500
than now. 65 million years ago hung like a horse. That's all I can do. I don't know

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:35,140
more power. We have to say that you find a very nice hotel. I have to get used to the boutique

72
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:41,220
hotels. Didn't even know what it was. I thought that boutique was, you know, where you buy your clothes.

73
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,700
It is boutique hotels. That means not much in the room. Mm-hmm.

74
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:58,740
Very minimalist, minimalist. One stick of bamboo, just, you know, a single stick of bamboo in a square

75
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:06,260
base. It's art. Yeah, these sort of things. Very trendy. But it's not, it was the only two bedroom

76
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,340
suite in New York. It was available. But very beautiful people in the lobby. I could see that.

77
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,940
What hotel is it? You might as well tell them. The Alex. Yeah, give me a plug. Yeah.

78
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,540
Guys with black suits outside with earphones. Yeah, like secret service. Yes. Yes.

79
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,700
It's totally got all the bullshit. The man in black. The bullshit. One of the men in black guys in

80
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,700
a very nice restaurant next to it belongs to the hotel. The food is very healthy. Good health.

81
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:43,140
Now, very good. A little bit, you know, sort of a Chinese kind of a feel to it. Very, very healthy.

82
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,140
We ordered a couple of times. Nothing for children. Now, let's get back to Johnny Vaughn.

83
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,580
Johnny Vaughn. I remember you asked him on the airplane. Well, that was not your first of all. We saw him.

84
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,580
And he had a vault spot. No. And I said, we're sitting here. Now, we said, God, this guy is so annoying.

85
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,700
Look, he's jumping around before we went into the plane. Remember that?

86
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:12,020
And so we noticed him right away. He was talking really loud and a bit. Yeah. And he had this little

87
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,180
fat kid's sidekick with his dad that probably ate a few other kids. And his kid was like,

88
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,860
everything's so funny with that. You know what that was? I think that guy was also traveling in upper

89
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:29,860
clubs. He was, he was, no, no, no. I think he's a television producer or something who works in England.

90
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,100
You've definitely successful. Somebody will be jumping up to somebody there. I think Johnny Vaughn was

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:44,020
sucking up to a fatso. Because he seems, he wants to, of course, see if he can do something else.

92
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,780
Well, apparently he's on some TV show. He was, because he was reading a script.

93
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,340
Can you ask him? So what do you up to? And you are, he said, oh, well, it's a surprise.

94
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:59,380
And he said, no, no, no, no, no. I said, oh, you're going to do something exciting. And he said,

95
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,940
oh, if I told you when beats that exciting. And that was like, fine, blow me up. I mean,

96
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,940
you don't want to say this. Oh, you were probably, everyone was thinking, I don't think you can

97
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,020
give her the money. Oh, she said horrible things. You were totally thinking that. I

98
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,820
doesn't want to tell you. So I go find them. I'm not going to talk to you. He's horrible.

99
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,820
But mom was talking to him. I didn't say anything. I just, you were probably thinking that.

100
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,660
Because I'm sure you were, of course, I was thinking that. I said that you were probably thinking

101
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,020
to unconscious dad is to arrogant. He doesn't want it. He wants it doesn't want to talk.

102
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,300
But I'm about to Jay status now. I'm on one road above the lowest road. I talk to anybody.

103
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,340
He doesn't matter. Yeah, that's why people usually people and people person. Yeah, people like, oh,

104
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,140
we can say that people love talking to you. Anything I want to know about it. I want to know why

105
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,660
people are this hyper. Yeah. What excuse me? Yo, why are you so goddamn hyper?

106
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:58,740
I think exactly sorry. So that's why I thought because he was so busy showing off and letting

107
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,660
people know that he was reading a script. Yeah. You know, it was pretty good. So that's why I said,

108
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,260
okay. But let me tell you, having done a morning show for a year, it doesn't even make

109
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,900
it. But it makes you fucking wacky. I mean, you have no likes any flies. Yeah, no life. Any flies

110
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,620
to New York every weekend to do the whatever show he's doing over here. So this doesn't

111
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,900
hurt him. Oh, it's not so like for eight weeks or whatever. Yeah, we're just little tiny bag,

112
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,420
nothing, nothing important in there. Believe me, that's so messed up. That is, so we have to have

113
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:39,780
respect for for morning people, but somebody has to do it. Right? Okay. So now we're in a hotel here.

114
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:47,540
And we slept him around today. We wanted to go to see a couple of things. It is very muggy and very

115
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,700
also hot. We actually we skipped the weekend. We've been here Saturday and Sunday. Now it's Monday,

116
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,780
Saturday and Sunday. We just, you weren't there. Well, you went out. You went out. I went out with you.

117
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,620
Yeah, you went out with you. You don't even know you were there. Sunday, where are we going?

118
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,500
It works around like a zombie named Central Park. Yeah. We went to Central Park. We went into Central Park

119
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,540
in the opening and sat down on a bench and then went home. Yeah, right. This set to sit up. Yeah,

120
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,580
and I said, this is even better than in a fashion show because it's nice to see just all those

121
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:26,180
people passing by. It was. Sorry. So now we're here and we just been outside. You know,

122
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,780
you have a little Madonna accent happening, you know that? Oh, I hope so. Yeah, you have a little

123
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,980
bit of the, for Dutch people that is absolutely fabulous. No, but I mean, like the Madonna English

124
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,820
accent. Oh, it is. So you're like an abstract. Yeah, I'm English American now. Yeah, English

125
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:51,540
Dutch English American. Wranglish. So now we're sitting here. It's very muggy. One time I said,

126
00:10:51,540 --> 00:11:00,660
now, it's about four. Yeah. And Edom was sweating. We are going in and out of stores and Edom was standing

127
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,100
outside and the poor guy was sweating. You were sweating like it was so high. I'm cold medicine.

128
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,060
I didn't say that. I was just like dripping on everybody. I was actually, I was sad I didn't have

129
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,220
my microphone because I mean, I couldn't say anything because I was just too tired to talk, but

130
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,780
a lot of interesting sounds. Yeah. Very interesting. Yeah, all different languages. If you're just

131
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,740
standing on one spot in New York and listen, interesting sounds and people on cell phone conversations.

132
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,900
We were walking near a Chinatown. No. Which is always I like that. I like to go to

133
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,220
to these sort of parts of the city. Because that's interesting. Christina, how is it to be back

134
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:50,660
in New York, your mother country? I'd never live here. It smells dirty. Sidewalk is like one big

135
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:57,220
puddle of grime. We're purple shoes that are not purple anymore. It's maybe when I'm back in

136
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,780
New Jersey for a while. I think, oh, I remember it's a suburbia. I'm used to suburbia. I'm not

137
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:08,180
a little New York thing. But you see a lot of interesting people. But the other day, I've just been

138
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,020
noticing that England is actually more obese than America now, but I did see one particular person

139
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,220
where the big McDonald's like backpack, you know, like the extra big takeaway bags. And she was

140
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,980
saying to us, but look at subway over the, I don't eat subway. So I said little dinky toppings.

141
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,220
And I was thinking, have another burger. I mean, what do you eat this morning? Your children?

142
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,060
She was so big. It reminds me a lot of England, actually. Everything's kind of really close.

143
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,980
American England, kind of close to England's a little bit, maybe more classy. But still,

144
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,100
it's good to be back to see and compare what I've been away from for a while.

145
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,500
People like Haiti. Yeah, really. It's true, though. Everyone's obsessed with fat people.

146
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,220
But they're all fat. Is it how? I'm just, you know, they need to be, I mean, I've been

147
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,220
you're, I'm kidding. And skinny. It's just they can't all be skinny. But the fact that they're just like,

148
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,540
you know how subway is, the sound, which is like a meter. Well, I personally think that America,

149
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,580
you know what? The terrorist don't have to do anything if they just leave America alone will eat

150
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,260
ourselves to death. I'm telling you. No, just eat a look at what we're eating.

151
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,620
No, but they're trying. You can see the TV. I mean, basically it's all about eating shit here.

152
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:35,700
It is really. But in, like, when we're all dead, that this generation, fast food won't be around anymore.

153
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,780
It won't be. I don't think it will. I was talking about it with my friends once.

154
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,940
We don't think that fast food will be around anymore. That's just temporary thing for this generation.

155
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,380
And that eventually it will be against the law to be served. There will be against law to serve fast food,

156
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:56,340
because it's, well, we heard, we heard, and if you look on TV, we haven't been watched American TV for a

157
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:04,740
long time. It's almost unwatchable. Yeah. Yeah, we noticed that it's actually a little bit disappointing.

158
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,420
Don't you think so? Yeah, I do. I'd like to hear from you. Why? It is very empty.

159
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:25,220
Don't you think? Yeah, it's very empty. It is all about, if you look, if you look at the presenters,

160
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:38,420
there's so much, there's so busy, puking, as we say, puking that, I, you know, Adam taught me that,

161
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,420
that is a proper way. Hey, now, you know, they're so busy. No, they're projecting. Really

162
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,220
loudness. So you understand exactly. Yeah, because there's a way to talk in the way and be seen by

163
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,700
it. But if you listen, they don't say anything. They don't say anything deep. They don't say,

164
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:04,660
they don't say, they don't say, there's actually no information. There's no information. It's about

165
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,700
stuff you're going to die from. The kids are going to get killed very negative. Very negative,

166
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:20,340
the news. Where's produce Pete? I miss him. Yeah, I'm not eating produce. But not many happy things

167
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:33,460
that they have to write. Sorry. Yeah. No. So we noticed that, but it's, of course, it's holiday now.

168
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:41,460
So they have repeat, repeat everything that we see in England too and in Holland. We've seen

169
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:51,460
already everything. But no, I don't think the quality of the American television is better. No, no,

170
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:58,500
I'd say it's exactly the opposite. Actually, I'm disappointed. What if I compare it with the English

171
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:06,580
television? It is better. Yeah, it's much better. Yeah, information is better. I talk about BBC

172
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:14,580
or series. BBC and ITV. It's more serious now. And if they have the news, it's more serious

173
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:23,140
and more, they have more information. Don't you think so? Oh, yeah. And also the presenters and

174
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:32,580
the quality of them. Yeah. And the shows. We have lovely shows in England. Thank you,

175
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,380
thank you, thank you. Beautiful big bands. And, and, and, and, and, and, and this is how it's turned this morning.

176
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,660
I had heard him in a while. And you know what I said? Oh, yeah. I said, actually,

177
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:50,340
how it's turned sounds like a podcast. You know what? Show. Yeah. You know the way he speaks the way

178
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:59,940
his tempo is no, not at all. No, no, no, no. I don't even know how to do that. But, um, and it also, again,

179
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:09,940
he's talking about. Was it in-out? Content? Content? Content was nothing special. No, that's where he

180
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:17,300
differs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And people that make podcasts shows, they have really, you know,

181
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,540
something to say and something to tell you, something explained to you. Yeah. But, um,

182
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:29,220
listening to it this morning, it was, uh, I laughed now. And then, because it's funny. And, uh,

183
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,340
play was nothing special. It wasn't like, to, uh, all wife's. I love it shocking because it's an

184
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:40,100
American. He's talking about poop and sex. No, he doesn't. He does. Yeah. Oh, but you're a little bit

185
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,860
of vulgar. But that's already, you know, he doesn't have to do that. It's still like in the

186
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,940
American. Like, oh, that sucks wrong. He's no meant to say that. I think that's the same reason

187
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,820
why we have shows like the old world. But it's not what he showed. What was very interesting. He said

188
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:00,820
that the television, um, even the sports shows and everything. If you hear some interviews with sports

189
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,660
guys, now you know that sports guys are using a lot of bad words. That's the way they speak. Yeah.

190
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:14,660
And they, uh, who said that we are shouldn't, um, uh, shall I let it go for them now?

191
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,180
Sense. Sense for themselves. If you can, they censor so much. He said it's ridiculous.

192
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,660
One of these days, you will not even, you know, get people to, to do interviews or anything,

193
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,980
because you cannot anymore. You cannot do that. There's nothing going to be left. He said,

194
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:37,380
what's going to be left of, of interviews and all sorts of other shows because they're

195
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:45,460
bleeping and bleeping. And he was, he was, um, having an example. And so we were listening to

196
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,460
something and they bleep, they bleep constantly. And it was just a couple of sports guy telling

197
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:59,300
that it wasn't their, their day. They said she's, you know, stupid things like it sucked or anything.

198
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,460
They bleep, suck. They bleep that. Really? So they, they're not even allowed. Yeah. They

199
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,220
don't even allow to to say, uh, use these words. No. Oh my goodness. Not that you would use those.

200
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,620
I do. Yeah. I do actually a lot. Oh, that sucks. You know, it's not that bad. But even that word,

201
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,020
and it was one of the sports guys said, oh, I really suck today. That is normal. That,

202
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,180
it's not bad. So they bleep and bleep and bleep. And he said, you know, that's why people

203
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:36,260
love to listen to podcasts and to how it's turned probably because it's, the guy still says

204
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:44,100
anything he wants. And really, just though, he talks, the way people talk. Yeah. I think that's,

205
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,220
that's why he's such a success. It's the puking. It's going to be worse. The radio and

206
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,860
television. Oh, yeah. Because you noticed that. Yeah. Don't bring your puking to our podcast.

207
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,660
No. No. No. Okay, Christina. Puking is active. You want to wind it up?

208
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:05,460
What? I don't know. You started it off. What do you want me to say? But I don't know.

209
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,740
I'm too afraid. I'm going to shock the world. I don't know. Do all that. Don't say anything. That's

210
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:21,220
there. You don't know. How have you been enjoying yourself? I mean, it does suck the

211
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,420
appearance of sick. That does kind of blow. It's still been good. I like the view from

212
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:32,580
the hotel room. I've seen a lot of it this week. No, it is really good at night. All the lights. It's

213
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,820
beautiful because we have windows down to the floor. Down to the floor. So that it's, it's amazing.

214
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,020
When all the lights go up, you stand on the couch. You feel like you're setting on the edge of the

215
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,940
building, looking down everything. I'm on top of the world. Yeah. And you know what last night when

216
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:53,860
Daddy was already asleep, we stand on the couch. It's naked. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I only are underwear.

217
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,420
And it was just like we were floating, you know. That's about to soon. It was wonderful. I was

218
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,620
already sweating. Yeah, you were sweating too. I'm not just sweating. I'm experimenting. Yes,

219
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:12,900
it's nasty. Juice is a float. Thank you. You're flowing out. It's theater of the mind. Yeah.

220
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:20,980
Okay. So we'll do another podcast tomorrow. All right. If I can talk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're really, you're still

221
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,820
staying Charlie and chocolate back three tonight. What? We're still staying Charlie and the chocolate

222
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,380
factory. If I don't collapse up, you happen to go with you. You have to walk over to time square

223
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,820
right. Yeah. But you know that the movie theater here are very loud. People are very loud.

224
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,020
Yeah. Stinky throw off stuff in the screen. I know. You know, on the floor, everything is

225
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,460
cracking on your feet and, you know, a bottle's and dreams thing. And don't find it. It's pretty

226
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:54,020
good. Sometimes. We're not going to get us to get us. That's the way they are.

227
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,700
It's New York. It's New York. It's New York. Yeah. Because we have a few small ones in England.

228
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,380
Yeah. But we noticed that it is a dirty city. Wonderful. Wonderful. It's just one. It's just

229
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,460
no. There isn't no other city. There's our city. Oh my god.

230
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,420
Yeah. But it is overwhelming. It is overwhelming.

231
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,980
Overwhelming? Yeah. Everything. The buildings.

232
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:34,020
It's big. It's so big and so high and so huge. And you feel so small and you're a little hotel room.

233
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:40,420
Well, particularly you from the only restaurant. Yeah, it's a lot of other tribe members though.

234
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,220
Yeah. I'm going to see what's got your shorter. People are going to think I'm so small,

235
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:51,540
but I'm not. But it's just an amazing hotel. The Hobbits are amazing. I know that tall.

236
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:59,540
You are for 14-year-old. Yeah. You're tall. Yeah. Well, Ellie's shorter than you. She's not going to grow.

237
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,500
Her hands are like, if you bend your fingers and your knuckles at her hand, you should see her clap.

238
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,140
But it's so cute. Well, actually now all we noticed is that you're a horrible child.

239
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:15,700
Yeah. Everyone makes fun of her too. There are a lot of tiny peoples. I feel very much at home. Really?

240
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:24,340
Yeah. You and Willy Wonka. Yeah. No, Willy for you. Okay. All right. We'll talk to you all tomorrow.

241
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,220
That was 25 minutes. I hope people are interested in listening to all that.
