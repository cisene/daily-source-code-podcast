1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-5-5.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We saved!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've been told what to like and then like it.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In my opinion, if you're over six years of age and you're still getting your music from the radio,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
something is desperately wrong with you.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I can only hope that somehow MP3 players and file sharing will destroy FM radio

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the way they're destroying record companies.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then, even though the air will probably never be safe to breathe again,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
maybe it will be safer to listen to it.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There are no secrets.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll be information you don't even have.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now I'm Korean.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And it's Thursday, my friends October 6, 2005, crisis in the cottage.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh yeah, it's been one of those days.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Everything has been gone wrong.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I'll tell you all about it, of course.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because in that way you tune in to find out about how even my life can mess up.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, of course you do.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And for some of the pod save too.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Which of course today I will get to.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, they was kind of a rant that I went on.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It certainly made me feel good.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And this morning, it kind of happened all over again.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I woke up.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Actually, I could barely get to sleep.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was so excited about the evolution of the original idea.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We had here yesterday about the pod safe music network and about rights organizations.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Did my homework?

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Looked at a couple of things.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Actually, I dreamt a lot last night.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
All about Armageddon and pod save music was very, very Jewish to scenario.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's a little bit later than normal.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I apologize.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's 10 after two local time here in Gilford, Surrey in the United Kingdom,

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
where we bring you the daily source code.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
When I'm over on this side of the big puddle, I got to kind of keep my eye on the door.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Of the window, actually, to see if the DHL guy is arrived.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And I cannot miss it.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He has a very important package.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He has to transport to Paris.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Curious?

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, I'll satisfy that in this show.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And hopefully, of course, the Mac will hang in there.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Just another one of the minor crisis you've had today.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Looked at all of that in just a few minutes.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
First up, Art Adub, Art from mashuptown.com, gave me a couple of different files to check out today.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
His mashups.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He had three options.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And for me, there was really only one.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It was also his first choice.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you like the who and the Beastie boys, you'll love front and on the route down.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

Yeah.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

108

127
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

128
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:29,480
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

129
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:59,480
We're gonna kick it from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death

130
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,380
from death, from death, from death,, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from death, from off which one.

131
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:13,380
Until came from death, because one died and he survived, he died, he died.

132
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,380
It's not like that.

133
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:24,500
Turned up loud in the studios on the speakers, you know, that's something that I forgot to talk to you about

134
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,300
back in the day, and remember we talked about how the turn table were started with the relays and Big SLIPMATS.

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,660
fader on all of our mixers back in the pirate radio station days and

136
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:42,920
Funny the Microsoft which would actually run 220 volts through it, which was fucking stupid because you know if you press down too hard on the the metal casing of the

137
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:51,180
Of the mixer there was a real potential shock hazard and many of this jockey has spilled the beer in the in the console and been electrocuted

138
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,100
No one with horrible results, but we'd have a micro switch in there and when you

139
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,900
Pull the fader up for the microphone a red light. Yeah, a real on-air light would go on outside the studio door and the speakers would cut off

140
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,900
Boy, that's something we got to get back to that again. Oh, there's so many things that we're remembering

141
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,860
So you heard the little hiccups here and there that was crisis number one today

142
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,340
I came in my Mac I'd never turn my machine's off by the way, which I guess there's two schools of thought on that

143
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,220
It's not about the power consumption which by the way

144
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,260
They you know, I got like three machines in the tube amp and the mixer and that all stays on all the time

145
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,580
So it sucks some real power, of course

146
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,860
But I walked in and I could hear my hard drive going

147
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,220
And that's usually a bad sign and

148
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,940
So I

149
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,820
Rebooted and it gave me that little can't find the system can't find the system icon

150
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,300
I was finally able to start it in single user mode and you know went through all the typical things

151
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,980
Man, it took like an hour to boot up after that and I went through some of the things that I would normally do

152
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,700
You know repair file permissions and such and it actually was kind of handy because while it was booting up

153
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,580
I was looking through the Gmail looking at some of the

154
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,420
Some of the comments that had come in and low and behold Bob was there was some ready advice

155
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,220
Mac heads pay attention. I add them. This is Bob host of the never published bomb cast

156
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,980
They'll have been figured out my format which so I haven't started but we've got some good things coming up

157
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,340
This mini cast is to address some of the issues that you discussed with your power book and thinking about getting a new one

158
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,940
Couple of things maybe four items to cover and less than two minutes if possible

159
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,340
And they should hold you over for a while now

160
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
I'm not sure which 12 inch power book you have

161
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,500
But I have a 12 inch 1.33 gigahertz hold on hold on Bob

162
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,700
I have a

163
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,100
month 17 inches baby your hurts with 768 megs around now since I bought that about a year ago

164
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,940
They have upgraded the power book 12 inch

165
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,980
One time it's very soft upgrade because it's a 1.5 gigahertz and it has 512 standard mine had 256

166
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,060
Mears is probably older than that. I would guess by what you've said on your show

167
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,100
So I'm assuming that you get something around a one gigahertz

168
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,260
Are you gonna upgrade? Yeah, you should upgrade you probably want to do one and here's what we know

169
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,820
We know that there's going to be a new version of power books staying in a G4 line

170
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,100
They were never able to get the G5 small enough and cool enough to put it into a power book

171
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,540
But moving right along we also know that apples ramping up to put Intel machines out and where they're slow

172
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,540
Where they've been slow to release the the performing machines has been in the power book line

173
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,580
We don't expect dibooks to get a G5 what you expect the power books to have something similar

174
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,300
So my guess is the first Intel release will be power books

175
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,940
And that means that if you buy that if you wait for that then it is sure probably we're getting it next

176
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,060
Then you're signing up to be apples beta tester

177
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,900
Dude, I have been beta testing for apples since since the what was that luggable thing the apple portable

178
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,900
100 was that it I had one of those I had the one

179
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:08,180
40 series the one 70 series the one 80 or 190 the duo docked to 30 C

180
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,660
The apple to the apple to x the top of the apple to fx

181
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,140
The Mac

182
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,820
Mac plus Mac ED

183
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Mac 512k

184
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,820
You know floppy disk based I've had

185
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,740
Remember the black power books. I've had every single one I am a lifetime beta tester

186
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,620
There's going to be a bunch of applications that don't quite work and and you know the ones are going to take the hardest hit or always the fringe guys guys

187
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,660
Like audio hijack pro. They're not mainstream and you know we hope that there's stuff works

188
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,100
But we rely on it and so it sucks when you get an image seen it just doesn't work

189
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,940
All on let me just say something. I'm pretty sure it won't

190
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,460
I'm pretty sure audio hijack pro won't work in

191
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,300
Future versions at least it won't work the way it's working today because it's way too easy to copy

192
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,300
To directly copy music from your iTunes and if you play an iTunes

193
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,940
If you hijack your iTunes and you play it and you record it you can record

194
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:15,220
Basically music that you purchase on the iTunes music store. I have a feeling that functionality is not going to be available pretty soon

195
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,700
Which is a major freaking bummer

196
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,340
And hopefully only that stream will be cut off because I use audio hijack pro on the other machine here to actually

197
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,460
Actually record in addition to that

198
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,580
You become their beta tester and you can't afford to do that with your main stream machine the machine that you're living on so

199
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,700
We do know that there are new power books coming in the G4 line

200
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,260
It'll probably be another pretty wimpy upgrade, but I would wait for that upgrade before you buy your new power book

201
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,860
And then I'd snap one up and expect to ride the storm out until the second generation Intel pieces come out

202
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,020
a couple of other things mac and end.com says that the Apple is planning a special media event on October 12

203
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,780
It's an invite only event

204
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:01,220
It's one day after the announced their financial results for the fourth quarter. It's 10 a.m. October 12 the California theater in San Jose

205
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,420
And it's right after another special event in the very same theater where they introduced iPod nano

206
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
iTunes 5 in the Motorola rocker phone

207
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,620
Early last month and according to one report the invitation shows close theater curtains with the words one more thing

208
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,780
written on top so they're definitely going to release something. I wouldn't be surprised if

209
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:27,540
The new line of power books is in that list. So well now the the jury's kind of odd on that. I've received several messages of

210
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Who sent me that email

211
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Oh, that's second. I got an email from

212
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
a couple of people forwarded me a Yahoo email

213
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,980
Paul

214
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,420
About this special event some people think it's going to be

215
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,020
New line of power books and

216
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:52,420
Some people think it's going to be the video iPod. I got to tell you. I don't believe in it

217
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,060
I don't think Steve Jobs is going to do a video. I could be wrong of course, but I

218
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,340
Had this conversation with him and someone brought up the video iPod and and just to look on his face

219
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,100
He went like

220
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,740
Video iPod he said makes no sense. You know, what's the earphones of a video

221
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,900
When he said that

222
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,180
I was pretty sure that wasn't going to happen. So I'm I'm betting on the new power books. So you may want to wait for that

223
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,220
In addition to that you were talking about moving everything over

224
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:26,900
Well believe it or not 10.4 in the utilities folder has a set up slash migration assistant

225
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,620
And basically if you're running tiger

226
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,380
The set up assistant runs immediately after you install the macOS

227
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,620
So when you boot the machine you do have the option to use this migration assistant

228
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,580
Just connect both computers on your network or by firewire

229
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,220
And you'll be able to transfer all your data and it'll act like it had always been on that new machine

230
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,460
Before you do that though you want to clean up your hard drive and here's where you're having some problems

231
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,540
One rule of thumb on your boot drive is to make sure that you keep 10% of that drive free for

232
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,460
Disco operations if you've got a 40 gigabyte hard drive and you've got 39 gigabytes on it

233
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,340
You're asking for trouble and you know, I'm I'm going to stop

234
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,580
I'm going to stop does not that it is an interesting but

235
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,260
Feeling that none mac users will not be digging. It's up. I'll put the file up up

236
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:20,180
That's DHL Christ I got to explain to you why DHL is here. I'm going to pause this for two seconds. I'll be right back

237
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,420
Right I think the word for today is discombobulated

238
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,900
I'll come back to Bob in a second with his mac fix it to cast oh, man

239
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,300
So remember I told you that I had arranged for a special weekend for Patricia and her sister in Paris

240
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
where they would be invited to go watch the

241
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,100
Fall Chanel fashion show. Well, that's this weekend actually it's tomorrow

242
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,220
Tomorrow is the show and then they're gonna stay Saturday and hang out in Paris and then come back Sunday

243
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,260
So she left this morning. She left the house at 10 o'clock and really there's only a couple you know when I go on a trip

244
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:09,700
The only things I need are my phone my my power book increasingly less need the power book

245
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,060
Credit card passport, you know, that's pretty much all you need everything else is just baggage

246
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,540
So for Patricia it's her phone it's a credit card you know some cash of course for taking the cab from charred to go

247
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:28,900
To the hotel and and her heart medication and so she was off at 10 o'clock

248
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,620
After I took Christina to school and then I got a frantic text message SMS from the plane

249
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,220
I forgot my medication oh, man

250
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,020
I'm like okay, well, of course, you know my wheel started churning. Well, this is possible

251
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,140
I knew that she'd taken her medication this morning so she really doesn't need anything until tomorrow morning

252
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,580
But first I was a little worried you know if she's on the plane and she you know how you can just like

253
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:04,420
You know get a start-up. Oh my god, you know that feeling when you forgot something that goes through your whole chest and your whole body and your shoulders and your neck

254
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,820
He just feel horrible and you can even start to

255
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,780
Perspire

256
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,100
So I had these horrible visions of that happening to her and her not having her emergency pill over there

257
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
So I immediately called DHL

258
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:21,140
Actually, I normally would use FedEx, but FedEx doesn't have the same type of FedEx really isn't as good

259
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:29,380
I don't think for international European international delivery and they have a next morning next day before 9 a.m. guaranteed service

260
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,860
So got a great great person to DHL in the line

261
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,780
Explain the situation she said well we can get it there before 9 a.m. She said would you like a quote on that and I said yeah

262
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,860
Well, yeah, you know 102 pounds. I said oh let me think for a second if it's worth it

263
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,060
So that's why you know as waiting for the DHL guy and at the same time hoping that Patricia wasn't too freaked out on the flight

264
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
She's fine

265
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,900
And so now it's also all the medication. It's on its way with my hero the DHL man

266
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:08,820
So that was one of the crises that was that has delayed the show today and as I said the other one was the power book and you hear it's still skipping

267
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,220
Bob really put together a great cast. I'll have to get the full audio of this up online still another two and a half minutes of it

268
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,540
um

269
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,660
And he has you know, there's all kinds of tips that he has and I went through everything meticulously

270
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:29,620
I think my drive is just shot and I have like 20% of free space and I don't know what's going on and also this this

271
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,860
The book is just had it, you know

272
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,820
I've said this before you know the life of a power book. It's a couple of years and whenever there's problems you close it

273
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,860
Treat it like an etchisket shake it a little bit open it up it works and then at a certain point, you know

274
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,660
Who knows and then it it becomes a

275
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
video server for your television in the living

276
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
Something else about the skipping because of course

277
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,540
Lots of people are sending in comments

278
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,580
Hadn't spoken to cast blaster Mike for a couple of weeks and he came back

279
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,620
He was out he spent a couple of days in like a log cabin and

280
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,620
Completely reprogrammed cast blaster. I mean completely

281
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,940
And he's working on several versions at the same time one which of course will be for me because

282
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,500
I really want to use the product, but what what's exciting is he is now

283
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:29,300
And I'm still not he did did it down at the actual frame level of the MP3 players because the problem one of the big problems is the way that quick time buffers

284
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,780
The audio and Windows media player also has issues with that

285
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,660
Sorry

286
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:44,100
So he went down to the frame level of the MP3 files and and he is now created recreated cast blaster with the mix

287
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,980
Happening entirely in software

288
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,460
Zero latency

289
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,380
Zero freaking latency so you can use this thing and the sound is

290
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
Just phenomenal

291
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,220
Now doesn't it still doesn't have all the the control bits that I need to be effectively be able to use it

292
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,980
Just in the way I work that's my problem not the not the software's problem

293
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,820
So I'm very very excited about about what I saw and there is also no no delay on

294
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,540
And no

295
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,900
No delay in no skipping

296
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,820
Using the the new cast blaster so it's still I think it's beta beta or alpha beta alpha beta

297
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,660
I don't think it's been released to the beta group yet, but it's called a beta and was given to me

298
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:36,020
And I love it and hopefully we're gonna be able to talk about that a bit more in the very near future. What are we at now? Oh my goodness

299
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:44,980

The world's first Marilyn Monroe podcast join me for my bi-weekly show where I discuss Marilyn collectibles her life career

310
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,060
I even play Marilyn inspired music that I bet you've never heard

311
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:34,420
And if she did I see mine be alive

312
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,340
Yeah

313
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:04,860
I've been a Maryland fan and collector for over 15 years and I'll try to answer any questions

314
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,940
that listeners may have about this incredible woman.

315
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,100
More than 40 years after her death, she is arguably more popular today than during her

316
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,500
own lifetime.

317
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:21,060
So come and find out why at www.mymeralyn.ca or look for me in iTunes.

318
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,100
But don't just take my word for it, what do you think of the show?

319
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:54,060
I've been subscribed to that for quite a while and I'm going to make some

320
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
I think it is sent off a new promo.

321
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
Prohomers are welcome.

322
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:04,140
Always submit at podshow.com, send them in feedback, adamantcurry.com, please if you can, put

323
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:10,940
an MP3 up on a server and just send me the link to it and try to do some work on those

324
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
ID3 tags.

325
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,780
It really makes it a lot easier for me.

326
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:21,020
Got a lot of feedback, of course, based on yesterday's discussion and now I've had at least

327
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,820
three people email me saying, hey, you know,

328
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:29,900
this note on inepotter.org hasn't been updated since August, you know, can I take over

329
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,580
the note and as I might my standard response, please email the note manager, copy me, ask

330
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,940
him, you know, what is it, his or her intentions are and we'll take it from there.

331
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,140
And that's pretty cool because the conversation and I've seen it in the stats too, really

332
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,060
did send people searching, I guess everyone's perusing through the entire director to

333
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,100
see if they can find any horrible podcast that I don't listed and I got a great email

334
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,140
yesterday from the Netherlands, people have listened to the daily source code, what are we

335
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:07,580
episode, 255, 255 episodes, 255, probably somewhere around episode 30, I think I introduced

336
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:13,660
mode zones, banned from the Netherlands who independent, they produce all their stuff in their

337
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:19,900
attic, I think it's two brothers, they produce it on a Mac with Pro Tools and just it's

338
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,900
something about the vibe these guys have, it's something about, you know, just the song,

339
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,980
I just really like them, they also played at the North Sea Jazz Festival, by the way,

340
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,540
LeCivies, Bitties are applying to to perform there, of course, going to use as many

341
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,500
back channels as possible to try and get them in. So I got an email from your from the Netherlands

342
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:45,580
and you said, hey Adam, skinny, that's the, uh, one half of my Jones sent off, uh, hold on a second.

343
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,340
Have no one, that's not. I went too fast for me.

344
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:59,580
Skinny, uh, uh, Mo Jones has a new record coming out, it's titled My World and Skinny wanted you to have

345
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:06,940
the premiere of the first track off of the record, always the same, Mo Jones on the source code.

346
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,740
Everything notices in the school, everything's sacred, it's will, everything's safe,

347
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,980
and it's will, everything's life.

348
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:51,180
Everything's rich, it's will, everything's buyable, everything's buyable, everything's buyable, everything's buyable, everything's

349
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,980

354
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,980
It's not the ever-changes, it's always the same

355
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,980
It's always the story

356
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,980
It's always the story

357
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,980
Nothing ever changed

358
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,980
Nothing ever changed

359
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,980
Nothing ever changed

360
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,980
It's always the story

361
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,980
It's always the story

362
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,980
People who don't worry about things

363
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,980
They don't worry about things

364
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,980
They don't worry about things

365
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,980
They don't worry about things

366
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,980
They don't worry about things

367
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Yunzie!

368
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
From the new CD My World

369
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,980
Always the same

370
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,760
It'sפit

371
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,980
It's their own label

372
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,060
their own songs and permission to play it loving it and got to get these guys listed on the

373
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:03,300
pod safe music network. I know I'm gonna have to plug it again music.podshow.com, really, really

374
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:10,020
like that. Did I see Steve Gilmour's head poppin along? He's a big fan of Mod Jones. So, um, oh man,

375
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,060
I hope I can hook up with these guys pretty soon. They are so good live. They bring like a

376
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:21,380
rhumba box and a couple of the oil drums and a guitar and an armonica and they're and

377
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:27,540
they're good to go. Another crisis that happened today, uh, as they say, when it rains it pours,

378
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,740
so I was already late with the source code. As you know, uh, we are a simulcasting, uh, the pod squad

379
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:38,740
on uh, serious channel 103, which is right next to Howard Stern's channel. So, he's not there yet.

380
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:46,580
Welcome those of you, uh, just channel surfing. Um, and so the way that works is, uh, pww fenton from

381
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:52,660
digital flots and fine podcast. Uh, he manages all of that and uh, and this, it's quite a bit

382
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,980
actually just collecting all the pieces because they're all sent in the evening before such as my

383
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:03,060
show the day of, but I get up a little bit earlier because I mean, the UK. And, um, and so I emailed

384
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,580
them saying, you know, dude, here's what's going on, the power book Patricia's Heart Medicine,

385
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,620
I'm a little bit late, so don't freak out, it's coming. And in here back from them, I get a

386
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,460
a text message and he was in a car crash last night. Now, in nothing serious, he's okay. He's a

387
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,740
little bit sore, um, he got rear-ended, which normally is really nice. And, uh, I said to my

388
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:30,580
immediately, the pw, two words, man, whip, lash. Maybe that's one word. I said, we're sitting on a

389
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,020
cold mind by brother, but now his car won't function and wouldn't start and his ISP, which is

390
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,020
a roadrunner, so that's a pretty respectable ISP. And he's one of the super duper accounts,

391
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,620
was completely down. Uh, and so, you know, we're late and just, you know, I was like,

392
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,540
what are we going to do? And so I came up with a genius solution. I said, look, you got a

393
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,220
power book there, right? Because, you know, yes, to put all the shows together and then has to be

394
00:31:53,220 --> 00:32:01,540
converted to the satellite MP2 file, whatever, and then uploaded to their server. I said, you got a

395
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,100
Wi-Fi power book and you got one of those thumb drive, one of those USB one, you know, like 500

396
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:14,020
megabyte drives, he says, yeah, so, well, off you go, in a cab, to Starbucks, and uh, download the shows,

397
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,580
come back, stick the drive into your system at home, do the stuff, and then go back and upload it.

398
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,340
So, thank God for Starbucks. Remember those days when I used to stand here,

399
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,980
bitching and moaning about Starbucks, and then have to go to Starbucks and upload it before

400
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,260
there was a bandwidth in the cottage? Oh my goodness. Lots of great comments coming in from

401
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,860
people about podcasting and pod safe music. Next, five or six minutes or so, I want to talk

402
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,740
about it and want to tell you a little bit more about my idea for, um, for the pod safe music network.

403
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:55,140
I think, uh, think you're going to enjoy it. Oh, man. Christo, mighty. There you go. I think that

404
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,860
today is the day that I buy a new power book. Uh, I now have the spinning beach ball of death.

405
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:06,820
After I asked it to advance to the next file. Oh, man. It sucks so bad.

406
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:15,860
Piece of shit. Sorry about that. Try to take my composure there.

407
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:23,220
One to comment on a couple of things that's been going on lately. One is, thank you very much.

408
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,660
Um, getting up early in the morning and getting your, uh, your pod cast, the daily source code before

409
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:34,020
I go to work. I'm on the road all the time. It's been great. So thank you for that. Uh, it's one

410
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,940
less time I need to think up during the day. You might say, uh, the other thing is I wanted to kind of

411
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:47,140
voice a just a listeners kind of point of view for, uh, for, um, this whole idea of the music industry and

412
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:53,300
what's happening. You know, I kind of gave up with music. Um, and I just subscribe to Yahoo,

413
00:33:53,300 --> 00:34:00,100
make music for, you know, a yearly account for what 50, 60 bucks a year plus Rhapsody. I had that for a while.

414
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,300
And I just kind of gave up with it. And, um, I have X and satellite and that was kind of nice.

415
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,420
But, uh, pod casting is done for me. Something that I think a lot of other people that

416
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:17,700
listen to pod cast, um, it's given me kind of an appreciation again for music. And I'll give you an

417
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,100
example, uh, Rob Costlow. I guess it was this name. I'm, I hope I got it right.

418
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,020
One of the, that was just beautiful piano playing. Now, I'm kind of conservative in my mother-in-law's

419
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:34,100
very conservative. And she heard that. And right away, she said, who is this? Who is this? And boy,

420
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:41,220
it is so refreshing. I mean, I, I hate to use these words because it is a paradigm shift. It really

421
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:47,300
is a thinking because a lot of the stuff that's going on right now isn't so much the monetization

422
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,740
right now. But it's building a relationship. I mean, pretty soon, these artists are going to have

423
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:59,940
a following. And, um, I'm going to want to give them money because I want to know what they're doing.

424
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,540
And where they're going. And I feel like as a, as somebody who's just in the very beginning stages

425
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,460
of this, that as they grow as an artist, they're going to, yeah, I get to be important in their life.

426
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,220
And, um, I think that's what's going on with podcasting. It's, it's, there's a, you know, a thousand

427
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:26,020
podcasters out there. But what is doing is it's raising the level of, um, what's the, what's

428
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:32,260
the best way of saying it? Um, it's transforming a relationship that you can have with the, with the, with

429
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,540
the artist. I mean, you can really talk to an artist in a way that you couldn't talk to. Even if you

430
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:43,140
don't, you know, it just by sitting in email to somebody or just knowing how, how cool it was to,

431
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,780
to get somebody into the beginning stages and be recognized. And you were there for them.

432
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,540
I mean, I think this is the greatest thing going on right now. And pretty soon, you know, this

433
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,700
way, I don't, I don't care anymore about the old stuff. I just don't care. It's not that important to

434
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:04,420
me anymore because there's so many good people out there that all they have to do is start.

435
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,620
And, um, man, I'm looking for the, for the next beetles out there. I'm looking for the next guy

436
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:15,300
that's just going to say, hey, you know, this is how I got started. And, uh, me, Mark, I was listening

437
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,500
to him in the beginning and, uh, follow their career. And, uh, you know, at old radios dead,

438
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,260
old old radio, uh, CD, the record company said, got to change and get with the program here,

439
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:32,740
because I'm just Joe average, but Joe average is starting to get a little tired of the old way of doing

440
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,260
things. And I'll find this stuff I want to listen to. And, uh, so, so that's my two cents. It's just,

441
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,820
um, you know, you don't have to broadcast or anything. I just want to tell you how I feel because

442
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:48,820
this has made a change in my life, uh, not just the music, but all the, the smart people out there

443
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:54,500
that are podcasting and the funny stuff. I mean, uh, if once people get in the habit of it,

444
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:00,740
I can never see going back to, to old, old media again. So, uh, that's it. I'll talk

445
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,700
you later. Thanks again for putting your podcast early in the morning. It's, it's, uh, it's, uh,

446
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,660
it really is cool getting on that damn freeway. And it's, uh, parking lot out there and, and L.A.

447
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:17,140
and being able to, you know, listen to some fun stuff, you know, with no commercials. Man, that's great.

448
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:23,620
So, thanks. Mark, right on, man. Uh, I really wanted to broadcast this because that's exactly

449
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:30,020
the voice that, that I love hearing is when, um, Joe average, as you say, and, uh, look at this,

450
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,780
look what happened, man. You're listening to my show on your commute, and then I don't know

451
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,060
exactly what you recorded this on, uh, doesn't really matter. Um, it came in as a wave file.

452
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,020
Uh, so probably some, maybe it was on your, um, none of your iPod, obviously, but on, um,

453
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,020
on some portable device, maybe your phone or something like that. If this is fantastic. You're

454
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:55,060
absolutely right. Absolutely right. I'm loving it. It was worth all the hassle to get to that

455
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:02,660
wasn't it? So, I had some more thoughts about, uh, the pod safe music network, and how,

456
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,860
remember we talked about, um, um, about the, the performers and the people who make a song,

457
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,900
which is the author composer, this is what I feel by the way, author composer, uh, producer,

458
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,180
and then the musicians. And, um, ask a BMI, if you're a member of either, and I went through

459
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,500
these sites, I've done a lot of research. I got another beach ball on my Mac by the way. Steve,

460
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:30,580
Steve Jobs sent me a new Mac. Now, please, please, crying. It's a hand-pring my work, man.

461
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:40,180
Um, what was I saying? Okay. Um, so of course it would be great as we start to monetize, not all,

462
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,180
but, you know, some pod casserole monetize, and I think it's only, we discussed this. I think it's

463
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,380
only fair that if you use someone's music, and that is a part of your product, um, that they should

464
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,540
be compensated for that. Now, the, here's, is what's, and here's what I found out was very interesting

465
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:01,700
about, uh, the way Ask Cap and BMI work. They, uh, talk about a, uh, basically a defined or a finite,

466
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,660
pool of money that can be brought in because, and that's it really hit me, there's only a certain

467
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:15,700
number of radio stations. There's only X amount of frequencies. There is no growth. The only growth

468
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,500
can be in more listeners, more revenue. Well, if we know anything, we know that it's exactly

469
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,980
the opposite. Radio revenue is going down. Listener ship is going down. Now, let's look at pod

470
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:34,420
casting. Pod casting is unlimited. So, maybe we have 9,000 podcasters today. Why wouldn't

471
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:40,900
that be 90,000 in a few years from now? And if every single one of them is donating just a little bit,

472
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,580
just a little piece, not like Ask Cap and BMI have or actually BMI has, uh, has a specific podcast

473
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:53,300
license. And it's so complicated. It's like a minimum of $288 a year. And then you have to,

474
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,300
you know, you have to track everything. And then they'll come at audit you. And then you have to,

475
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,300
say, okay, how, you know, what percentage of, it's like 1.75% of your growth revenue,

476
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,940
you know, but then you can subtract 15% for agency commission. It's just, it's, oh, man. And,

477
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,940
and if you get played on the real radio quote, real radio, there's a whole, the, the distribution

478
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,940
of money is even fuzzy. You know, it's like you get, if you have a hit record, then you get a

479
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,540
super hit bonus and you get extra payout, you know, because they can't, they do have one system that,

480
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:32,180
that most, most people are not subscribing to, called BDS and BDS listens. It's a computer

481
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:38,580
program that listens to radio stations and can detect based upon waveform, basically what's

482
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,460
song is being played. So I'm not going to lay the whole thing out right now, but first of all,

483
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:49,060
I have a name for it's called the Podsafe Music Rights Organization or a nice acronym Pro. I kind of

484
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:55,300
like that. Podsafe Music Rights Organization. And it would of course be a nonprofit. And I have a

485
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:02,420
way, and I don't want to delve into all that right now, but I have come up with a way that anyone

486
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:08,180
who is podcasting can use Podsafe Music. We can do that already through the Podsafe Music

487
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:15,300
Network, but also each time you use a Podsafe song, the artist will get paid, not just the

488
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,780
artist, but those four categories, right? And I'm seeing it as kind of like an equal four-way split

489
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:25,860
with the, the, the, the vocalist and musicians, they're divving up their split. And that may not

490
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,660
be the right way to do it yet, but I'm, I'm pretty confident that it's, the fairest thing is

491
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:36,020
author composer producer and performers because there are organizations throughout the world for

492
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,780
every single one of those groups. So if we could have it all in one and the Podsafe Music Network,

493
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,460
and let's just say that I haven't figured out, I haven't figured, and you wouldn't even have to

494
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,460
report back anymore. You wouldn't have to report into the system because the BDS sound system,

495
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,020
well, you know, that's easy. We know how to analyze wave files. We deal with it every single day.

496
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:04,420
And we can do a much more accurate count. So we can actually distribute the money, like I almost

497
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:09,460
aren't like a certainly a monthly, probably a weekly, even a daily basis. And of course,

498
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:14,660
it all do it through PayPal and, you know, we'd be very, very online about it. And here comes the

499
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,220
kicker. This is the part I love. No, wait a minute. No, no, no, I'm going to tell you about the

500
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:24,020
part I love in a second. First, let's talk about reporting for a second because another faux

501
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:29,780
pot has taken place in my friends. Now, let's see if we can get, uh, of course not. Of course,

502
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,780
it's not going to play. It's just going to sit there and give me a spinning beach ball. Hold on. I need to

503
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:41,780
kick something! Hey Adam, it's Derek Miller from the Penn Machine Podcast in Vancouver, Canada

504
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:50,020
at podcast.pen machine.com. I was listening to your Delta CR Charlie number 253,

505
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:56,660
where you were talking about podcasters, about 95% of the mom and pod save music network,

506
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:04,580
giving credit to the pod save music they're using. I hate to be a nag, but Adam, you're in the

507
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:14,180
5% because back on daily source code number 235, September 5th, where you did the job cast from

508
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:21,940
podshow headquarters. Well, the only had one song on that pod cast. It was mine. It's called

509
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:27,380
Cold Cloud that a nice pack. Well, you didn't list it on this pod save music network and you didn't

510
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,780
put it in your show notes. So, you know, it could hurt a little. You did, but I'm okay now. You know,

511
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:40,340
it's been a month that I've recovered. Anyway, just so you know, my pod cast is original pod save

512
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:45,940
instrumentals that podcasters can use them have for theme songs and background music and

513
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:51,940
well, and people that just listen to it if they like. So, once again, it's at podcast.pen machine.com.

514
00:43:52,660 --> 00:44:00,020
Give it a listen. You can also get it searching for Derek D.E.R. E.K. on the pod save music network.

515
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:05,460
Grab some of the music. Use it on your show. I'd love that. Anyway, go ahead to listen to the source

516
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:12,180
code and I'll check you later. Derek, man, I'm so sorry. I suck. But now there you go. It just shows

517
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:18,580
how hard it is. I reported it today, put in episode 235 and you're probably receiving an automatic

518
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,540
email from the pod save music network that I played it. I'm sorry, man. I really do. I love the tunes,

519
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,740
obviously, but it was because of the job cast. Oh, maybe I should do that now. We've had so many

520
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:34,580
interruptions. Again, the word is discombobulated. Let me play one more thing about the pod save music

521
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,100
network. Then I'll do the job cast at the very end of the show. Hello, Adam. This is Franklin

522
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,060
McMahon from MediaArtist Secrets. The pod cast for the creator professional at mediaartist.com.

523
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:48,100
And I have a pod safe music question for you. I just launched podmodel.com. It's an enhanced

524
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:54,100
pod cast for iTunes and the nano and iPod photo. Basically, it's pictures of my model and fashion

525
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,220
photography. And as I was developing, I was thinking, what a perfect place to put in pod safe music,

526
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:04,420
you know, for the background while viewing the images. And the problem is I didn't know all the

527
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:10,820
places yet where my shows are going to go. For example, my MediaArtist Secrets, that show is available

528
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,700
on CD and computer arts magazine. Now there's a special page on the CD interface and all. And now

529
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,180
that's something I didn't envision when I started the show early this year. It's a commercial

530
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,820
venture and you know, they're selling magazines. So, I know the thing I might want to do down the

531
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,860
road is sell a CD of podcasts, perhaps episodes that are no longer available or, you know,

532
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:34,660
things like that. Anyway, one of the thoughts, I look at anything I do as content and content

533
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:39,860
goes many different places over time. Places I haven't even thought of yet and places we all haven't

534
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:45,620
thought of yet. And I just think we need to start looking beyond iTunes and iPods to see, you know,

535
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:51,140
what the next step is, it would suck to have to go back and edit out pod safe music from these

536
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:56,340
things this content or, or is it safe? I don't know. This is just something I'm thinking about

537
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:01,140
over the next several years. We'll be able to download a received podcast in many, many, many new ways

538
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,860
and I'm just wondering if pod safe music can legally come along for the ride. So, we may not have

539
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:11,300
all the answers now, but I want to write. Of course. Of course, it stops right in the middle.

540
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:19,220
So, very good point there. So, that's what Pro would do. The pod safe music writes organization

541
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:26,900
would do exactly that. We would help you license for CD ROMs, for CD's, for any other type of

542
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,500
distribution. And if the radio industry wants to play any pod safe music, by the way, they're doing

543
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,100
it already. Just so you know, I mean, I know for a fact that some radio stations have definitely

544
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,980
played pod safe music because they dig it obviously and there's nothing against that, but hey,

545
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:48,580
hold on a second. Just like we have to play by your rules, you have to play by our rules. And I

546
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,820
predict that because the growth potential of pod casting is unlimited by frequency or by time

547
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,220
that the total number of, let's just call them spins, right? We agreed on that previously.

548
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:06,980
The total number of spins of a pod safe song will far outweigh what is being played on the radio.

549
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,420
Think about it. Think about how incredibly powerful that is. And guess what? That's when

550
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,260
everybody comes knocking on our door and when we get to turn the tables and where we get to

551
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:27,220
basically call the shots. So I'm really excited. And you know what? We don't need, go to Manhattan,

552
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:33,860
go to BMI's, they have the BMI has beautiful offices, beautiful building. I don't think I've been

553
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:40,020
I think I've been asked cap one, same deal. Lots of people work there and that's all in the,

554
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:46,980
because it's a non-profit, but they got really nice company cars and they may even have a company

555
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:54,900
jet for all I know. And they've got full time people sitting down the basement speculating with the cash

556
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,020
and would be very simple for us. Every week, we look at the money that's to be distributed.

557
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:06,100
And that's the part that I just want to hold back on before. I'm not quite ready to

558
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,580
talk about that yet. We'll say a no-dam announcements rule on that for the, for the time being.

559
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,180
And then we look at the number of spins and then everybody gets a percentage done.

560
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,300
It just, it all clicked into my head. It was completely clear to me.

561
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,820
So I'm really excited. We could run it with two people. Two people could run it. Everything else is

562
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,340
online. You do the same thing you do with those guys. You have to send off 30 bucks to the

563
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,620
copyright office. But you know, by the way, by the minute you lift your pen from paper,

564
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,580
you already own the copyright just so you know. Anyway, all that stuff to come, I'm going to go

565
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:47,780
throw this piece of shit out the window this Mac. I'm so angry about that today. I can't even

566
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,180
play the closing, the closing tune. I'm just sitting here looking at the goddamn beach ball. And I

567
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,660
tune to keep's popping up. I don't know what's going on. All right, everybody. I'll be back tomorrow.

568
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,660
We'll do a thank God it's Friday. It shouldn't take care now. Bye.
