1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Daily source code for February 23, 2005.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Transmators, we don't need no stinkin' transmators.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get ready for the generation of rocker.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And a podcasting.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's Adam Curry.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey everybody, welcome to the Thursday Disney source code.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
At least we'll call the Thursday edition because here in California,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we're still living in Wednesday.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
By the time you hit this, it'll be Thursday or Friday or Saturday or God knows.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It is the 23rd.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But the 24th.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm confused.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What is it Marcus?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What's Thursday?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's the 24th.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, wait a minute.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Did my announcer screw it up then?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What did she say?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
23rd, 2005.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Screw it.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
She's talking about bad programming.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's just call it the 23rd.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey everybody, welcome to the Daily source code coming to you from San Francisco, California.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From, uh, I love the hotel on Gary Street.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Kind of right in the middle of, uh,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
all the druggies hang out.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's all the drug addicts are here on the street.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
For the next 40 minutes, got some crap for you.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wow, we had a long, long day.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I posted on the weblog early this morning,

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
uh, that a source code wouldn't be up until later today.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, I certainly made that promise come true, didn't I?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Without doing meetings, meeting with lots of people,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and actually today we were in the valley.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Silicon Valley itself, which means you get on the,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
uh, on the 101, 101 freeway going south.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
She can tell I've got, uh, Marcus sitting here.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's, uh, hanging out in our studio in our Gary Street studio.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Uh, for those of you that haven't been introduced to Marcus,

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
we've been working together for about, uh,

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
was it Marcus three years now?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Three years.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He, um, basically keeps all my shit running.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's what we've been doing for the past couple.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How do we meet?

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How do we meet?

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How do you know?

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you email me and said, what?

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I do frontier.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I used to live in Holland.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, that's right.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You've got some interest in stuff going on.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then, uh, I said, yeah.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, uh, but the interesting thing is, uh,

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that although we've been working together for certainly a good, uh,

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
uh, three years, we had never met in person.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We've spoken on the, uh, not, not even on the phone.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We've spoken on Skype before.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And, uh, on what on, uh, I chat a couple of times.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We never actually met.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And, uh, I guess kind of like, uh,

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
if you know someone from, uh, from the telephone or, um,

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
if you only know someone from a radio broadcast or a podcast,

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
uh, and then when you finally meet up,

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it's like everything you expected this person to look like is completely untrue.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's completely different.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Um, but Marcus, you had the bent, you knew what I looked like, right?

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So that, that was, that was easy.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But, uh, I actually, without going into too much detail,

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but I thought Marcus was ten years younger.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Doesn't matter how old he is.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I won't give that away.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But ten years younger just because of his voice.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Um, and I thought he probably had really long hair.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I was kind of like a musician type, type rock and roll guy.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Long hair all one color.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Dude, I've got the gray here too, don't worry about it.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So, uh, we've been hanging out, uh,

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
actually speaking out, uh, for most of, uh,

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
uh, most of the evening, uh, in the hotel room.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Uh, we got the power books.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I had this, I got like a,

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
it shouldn't be happening.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've got, uh, I don't know if you can hear that.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've kind of interference on the wireless mics.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I wonder what's doing that.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Maybe some kind of,

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
ease dropping device in the room that is doing that.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So meetings in the valley.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
My goodness.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
For all the, all the noise, everything that's going on in, uh,

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in the world of podcasting,

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I gotta tell you that San Francisco, California,

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and well, particularly the valley, uh,

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
so that's like, uh, what's the valley?

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mountain view, sunny veil,

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
all those places that you may have heard of before.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They are fucking clueless.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I was so amazed.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It seems like when it comes to anything

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
or anything, MP3 players or anything,

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
iPod, everybody here is still trying to figure out

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
how to capture the music business.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And it's just, it's amazing.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And we do meetings with people, and yeah,

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
you know, they're really excited about podcasting.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But, you know, halfway into the meeting,

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it's like, you find out that they,

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
they never really even listen to a podcast.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's just, uh, it's like you're there in this big,

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
sinkhole of God knows.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And this is, of course, it's not true for everybody.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That would be completely unfair.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But when it comes to all the companies here that you'd expect,

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
uh, to know what is going on,

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
have a real good feel for it.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Wow, I was pretty amazed.

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Not that everyone we met with had no clue,

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
but woo, it was, um,

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
um, interesting to say the least.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So we talked a little bit about that,

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
a little bit about, uh,

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
also new, uh, applications, uh,

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've been playing around with.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And of course, we've got a matchup.

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And this one's, uh, music shape by the dog.

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't you get that yeah, yeah yeah,へep, make the border sure see itvin' all in the world, healthcare, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a bond between London and America and America, they're especially lonely Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah better, yeah, yeah, oh yeah yeah, yeah

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,360
It's another matchup that I received from Pimpedaddy Sid, the Pimpedaddy from Holland, but

161
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,000
like that one, Madonna music shaped me in, I was turning like Marcus here, this, but for those

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,600
of you who record your podcast on a Mac and if you use Audio High Jack Pro, you've probably

163
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,960
discovered that if you unplug the headphones, then Audio High Jack Pro kind of freaks out

164
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,120
on you, and we'll usually crash and we're talking about external mixers. I've been in the market

165
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,840
for a small handheld or battery powered mixer. Marcus actually had a really good idea during the

166
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,240
Madonna tune, said, how about going to the pawn shop? There's a lot of musicians that need money

167
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,280
in San Francisco and it's probably been pawning everything, so it's a good idea maybe Friday morning

168
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:52,200
because tomorrow going up to Seattle, I'll give you one guess who I'm seeing up there should be

169
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:00,920
interesting. It's been, wow, maybe, trying to think, it's probably been like seven years since

170
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:08,040
I've been up to Redmond, and of course there's, I think I told you about that, that a guy named

171
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,600
Aida Kuhers, who was a Dutch guy. I met a couple of years ago about four or five years ago in Holland,

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,720
he was just recently promoted up to some big muckery muck post up there and he knew us on the

173
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,720
West Coast, he said, I'll come on up and we'll talk and we'll do some stuff. I think that's kind of

174
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,720
turned into like we're meeting 50 people or something, but that's okay. Should be fun, it's always

175
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:35,560
good to find out what's going on up north. We're going to talk about today a couple of things.

176
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know if I'm going to make it 40 minutes because it is now 10 p.m. and we have to leave

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,880
the hotel at a quarter to six to make the 7 a.m. flight, which of course is having me regret the

178
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:57,400
fact that we agreed to come on up. Last night was the Wired Awards, the Wired Rave Awards

179
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:07,240
in the legendary Fillmore. It was, I didn't know exactly what I was to expect from an award

180
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,480
show, you kind of expect that someone will be up on stage and announce nominees, they're

181
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,280
announced winners and maybe there's a short word of thanks or something, but it was none of that.

182
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,960
It was almost like, I remember parties like this in New York, MTV used to throw parties like this

183
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,960
with a whole bunch of people who were just way too cool and hit for the room and they all kind of

184
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,440
mall around, eyeing each other and you know, no one really talks because the music is just a little

185
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,800
bit too loud and there's perhaps the drinks flow a little bit too freely and it was weird,

186
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,720
it was, I mean the setting was great, it was beautiful. I didn't recognize one single solitary person

187
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:53,080
in the entire, well no, it's not true. I met C. Carl Jacob who he actually got me started in a lot of

188
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:59,400
stuff when he was at Sun and that was, well that was before I started on ramp. It was good to see him.

189
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,280
What he'd do, he had a company called Dimension X, he sold that and then what he'd do he went

190
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:12,920
on to work for Cloud Mark, I think. God no, he's in a kite surfing right now, so that was good to

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,720
see him and I think there was no, what's the, Mark is you know, what's the virtual, the guy

192
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,880
like the credit as the father of virtual reality with all the dreadlocks, Lanier, I mean I can't

193
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,360
remember his name. Well anyway, you know that dude with the dreadlocks? Yeah, he was there.

194
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:39,960
He was there. Oh, but I did not win by the way in the category for tech innovator, I was nominated for

195
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:49,080
iPodder. The award went to blog lines. I think he's, what does his name Eric? I think it is.

196
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,960
Is that Eric? You eat it? Oh, is that it? Yeah. Well, what, what, what? Check, right. Yeah, I've got

197
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,920
markers here doing all the show prep for me. This is great. Most prep. Well,

198
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:09,240
speaking, we check it. Exactly. I was really proud of Mr. Colehouse or you might pronounce his name

199
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,280
his cool ass. He's a Dutch architect. He won for best architect. That was very cool.

200
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,440
But so there was no announcement of the winner. It was just like, you know, there were screens and

201
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,440
they, and the screens rotated the nominees and then it highlighted the winner. I was like, wow, yeah,

202
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,840
okay, that's all right. And then the editor and chief got on stage and the mic was, you know,

203
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,840
he had a love mic on, which is like that sucked. That didn't work. He couldn't hear him at all.

204
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,440
And then Danger Mouse did a couple sets. He's the guy credited with bringing mashups to the

205
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,520
masses, although I think that mashups have kind of been around for a while, but he did that

206
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:49,160
the gray album, the Beatles mashup with Jay-Z. So that was definitely cool. We played that on the

207
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,640
source code. So, you know, that's awesome stuff that he's doing. And so around 10 o'clock,

208
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,000
he's like, well, all right. Let's go. That was really nice. Oh, and all the nominees did get this

209
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,800
block of, there you go. So I think it's a aircraft aluminium. And note, by the way, I say

210
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,720
aluminium, which is the correct pronunciation. It's not aluminum. That is not actually an alloy.

211
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,360
I think that exists. It's aluminium. So this is like block of, you know, what does it like?

212
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,720
It looks like a like a die. And the size would be, what does that two by probably two inches

213
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,360
by two inches by two inches by two inches? And little ribbon weighs a ton. And I asked the nominees

214
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,040
to walk around with them. Listen to this thing. Hanging around your neck like this big anchor.

215
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,560
So that was nice. That was kind of cool. But what was really nice is they had the new

216
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,800
the new addition of wide magazine, which is a whole thing about radio. I don't know if I

217
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,360
told you about this. But it's basically about the death of radio. And they feature

218
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,880
serious satellite radio in there. They feature some terrestrial digital broadcast thing,

219
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,400
which is on my clear channel and podcasting. And you remember, I went through all that work

220
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:17,400
in in South Beach to do these pictures with a great photographer, by the way. We, you know, we got

221
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:24,120
an Audi A8 that they rolled in specifically for the photo shoot. And we spent a couple of hours

222
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,360
doing pictures there. Not one of those pictures made into the magazine. But then we did something

223
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,520
with a photographer wanted to do. Because I was like the photo editor wanted that picture of the A8.

224
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,360
And the photographer said, I want you something else. And well, if you get the magazine, you'll see

225
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,320
it. It's a, it's a, it's a, basically a full page shot of my face, which would be extremely

226
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,480
frightening. Had they not luckily completely photoshopped it. So I look like a, like a plasticine

227
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:56,920
wax doll. So there's no lines. And, you know, it's, it's fake, essentially. And even it's

228
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,760
even saw some comments on on credit card on the weblog people saying, wow, what kind of,

229
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,200
what kind of makeup are you wearing? Well, no, please. I mean, that was, that's not what I

230
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,520
really look like. That is all photoshop. And by the way, any magazine you pick up, if you think

231
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,880
that any of those bodies, particularly women's magazines, if you think any of that is real,

232
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,960
no way, it's all photoshop. Not a single solitary picture makes it into any magazine these days

233
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,960
without being photoshopped. And by the way, if I see one more commercial of Kate Moss

234
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,640
with get the fucking London look and these, and this I, what is it, mascara that's supposed to

235
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:41,160
make your eyelashes look really long? Please, she's wearing fake eyelashes, okay? So it's a lie

236
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:49,960
and it's fake and that's what the cosmetic business is. It's two cents worth of mud and two

237
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:57,800
million worth of marketing. So wired awards. Yeah, okay. I would suggest doing it differently,

238
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,720
and I think they would probably get more mileage out of it for their own magazine if they did

239
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,880
a little more, and just a little more traditional sense of an award show because it's just

240
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,360
nothing to do with awards. But it was really nice and it was great being nominated and I really

241
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:19,000
appreciated that, but yeah, anyway, moving along. Just before I started the show, my Skype

242
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,760
bleeped. I thought I had an incoming message or a phone call, but it was actually an upgrade message.

243
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,960
And I did the upgrade and low on behold, we have some spiffy new features on Skype for the

244
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,160
Mac now. I had the voicemail feature. I don't know if that's not standard in it or not,

245
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,760
or maybe you still have to get invited. I do have that voicemail features. That's cool.

246
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,000
But now you can also finally do conferencing from the Mac. So it looks like Skype is really

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,760
moving up and I guess this is a stable version and love in it completely, especially now with the

248
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,480
trip I've been calling home. I try to call home every at least once a day, sometimes two times

249
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,760
a day, but to be able to do that and just talk for an hour on the phone, basically,

250
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,000
for almost no money, is a confusing Skype out is absolutely fantastic. These guys are on

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,120
something really, really big. Speaking of new applications, I bought a lemon out with a new

252
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,760
new beta version for the Mac. I've been trying that out. It looks really clean, really fast.

253
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,640
I've also worked on putting up a cleaner version of the directory for them, which is

254
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,600
now sucking in. So that works a lot faster. They've got a clean up buttons. You can basically

255
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,760
delete all those files that are hanging around. I'd still like to see a little more a little close

256
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,160
like a Tvo functionality where basically you say, after two gigs of stuff that you've downloaded,

257
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,320
start deleting it or whatever. There should be some kind of preferences that we put in there

258
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,400
that a little bit beyond just delete old stuff or whatever. But that's just personal taste,

259
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,680
I guess. But it's looking really good. And there's a couple more two point out, even three

260
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,840
point out versions of iPodders coming along. So I'll try and keep you updated as much as possible.

261
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm really fried. I'm not going to keep this. I'm not going to make this too long.

262
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,160
About 18 minutes into the show. I did catch the new bitty cast. I'll just play a little bit in the

263
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,840
background here. If you want to hear what goes on with an all-girl band and the stuff they talk about

264
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,800
is a whack. Just listen in for a second. What I really like about it is the stereo sound is

265
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,120
so nice. They've got it completely separated left and right channel. Listen a little bit of the

266
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,560
bitty cast. The guy from B2 records like this record label. And then there was the man. That's Amanda.

267
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,160
One of those swing bands like Big Bed Booty Daddy or my command like that. And he's like,

268
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:45,320
well, you know, we made our record for a fraction of that cost and we're talking about how

269
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,600
cost efficiently they work. Yeah. And I totally met these girls in New York. They are so set up man.

270
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,400
They've got bitty's LLC. They've got lawyers. They've got a band fund. They're making money. I mean,

271
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,720
they're not really putting a lot of money in their pocket. They say not yet at least or not when we

272
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,640
spoke that could have changed immediately. But you know, they got money to record. They got money

273
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,080
to do their own tour support. It's just totally beautiful. And now with the bitty cast,

274
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,680
which you can find at bittycast.com, you can subscribe to the feed there. You know, live by

275
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:22,120
carously through them. I haven't even listened to this whole show. Let me see what's the length of

276
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,000
this one. This is from the 20th. It's a 26 minutes. I love well, of course. Well, you know,

277
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,200
they started out. They couldn't have started out any better to get my attention. Actually,

278
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,240
check this out. What were we recording now? You're doing a think of an intro. And so I

279
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,440
skipped the four of these at 16 loops. It's late. And we kind of do really. So get your attention.

280
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,920
Yeah, I thought it was. No, we have enough for our two people. That's true.

281
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:53,000
Each one of what? No. We got a lot of moves for it. But not 16. No, that's true. That's a little

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,280
you know. Okay. Well, if that is enough of the tease, then I don't know what is. Another podcast I ran

283
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,480
up a bump into something. I listened to it all the way through. It's just wow. This is such a tremendous

284
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,160
wealth of information stuff. I never heard about thought about, you know, it's the stuff that

285
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,760
usually have to go to college too to, and you know me, my academic career. You got to go to college

286
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,760
to learn this stuff. If you've ever wondered about the stars and the planets and astronomy in general,

287
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,320
you might want to check out slacker astronomy. Listen to a little bit here.

288
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Welcome to show number negative three of slacker astronomy. A podcast about astronomy and just about

289
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,320
anything else that floats over our heads. Every week or so, we will bring you a summary of recent

290
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,480
news events from the world of astronomy. And during slow news weeks, we'll simultaneously cast the

291
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:51,880
Howard Stern Show. You know, for the ratings. This week's show is about big, bad space, big, bad empty space.

292
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,080
It's kind of space that exists in W's head. Or so it often seems. W's victory in November.

293
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,760
Don't you wish? Don't you wish that you had a professor who talked about astronomy that way,

294
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,720
comparing big empty space to what's in George W's head? I mean, that's beautiful. Really pretty smart.

295
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,160
And recent events show that outer space is not as empty or as tranquil as it generally appears.

296
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,640
When we look up at the black night sky, we see a lonely wasteland of isolated stars.

297
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,120
It may feel as if our planet is alone in a drift in an empty universe. What most of us don't

298
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,440
realize is the same sky that looks relaxed and calm is in fact fiery and active. Stars are exploding.

299
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,120
Galaxies are colliding. And even the soft little gas clouds and nebulas are shooting microwave lasers.

300
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,840
So I don't want to give it all away. But basically, if you listen to this slacker astronomy podcast,

301
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,280
you'll be pretty worried about this explosion that happened 50 million light years away or a go or

302
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,920
what does it light years away or a go away? But if it's, if it's light years away,

303
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:57,000
then it takes, doesn't take 50 light years to get here? 50 light years or 50 regular years.

304
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:05,400
See, I stumped Marcus. 50 years in our time, a light year is the distance light travels in one year.

305
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,920
Okay. So that one million 800 and some, why do you know this stuff?

306
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,680
Anyway, you can find the slacker astronomy podcast through iPod.org, which is really heating up.

307
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:29,800
Thanks to some of the recent press that we've been getting. It's, I mean, normally we see about 10 to 15

308
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,840
new podcasts being listed a day. Now we're closer to 20 to 25. So it's really heating up. And by the way,

309
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:43,000
if you subscribe to the iPod.org RSS feed, you can actually have those come into your aggregators.

310
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,720
So you know, you wouldn't necessarily have to go to iPod.org all the time to see what's new.

311
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,720
And you know, you're pretty much, if you don't go there every single day, you're going to start missing

312
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,760
because it just has to scroll off the bottom at a certain point. But it's, that's just been,

313
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,120
just been phenomenal, the amount of podcasts that are coming online. I can hardly believe how much

314
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:09,880
is happening. Let me see, before we get into this, was something else that I wanted to say that was

315
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,560
really, oh, yes, there was hold on. I have all my crap here on top of this article.

316
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:25,560
I was, number is ranting about the security, the airport security in New York. Was it a great article

317
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:33,640
in the San Francisco Chronicle? I'm just gonna find the front page. I can't find that. Anyway,

318
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,120
there's a security firm at San Francisco Airport SFO has been accused of cheating.

319
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,680
And what that means is that the home security office or whatever you call that will send

320
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,240
undercover agents to all the airports, of course, to see if they can penetrate security. So they've

321
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,240
got like bombs and guns and all this kind of this contraband stuff that you should box

322
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,120
cutters, whatever. You shouldn't be able to take on the plane. And so of course, they do penetrate

323
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,440
through the security, but what the security firm, which is a private firm, by the way, hired by

324
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:23,400
the government, basically performing in a governmental role, what they did is, if one of these

325
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,080
decoys, I guess, would penetrate their security. And what would happen is, they'd go through

326
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,960
security, they'd smuggle whatever through they had, so like a knife or gun and they'd say, okay,

327
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:41,800
listen, I'm an agent here and you missed this. They had a whole system set up of 1,200 cameras

328
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,320
where they would follow this guy, because what he would basically do is he would then go to the next

329
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,760
security checkpoint and try to do the same thing. And so, you know, well, they call it cheating,

330
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,760
essentially, they would hand off that information all the way down the line, so the guy would never

331
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:05,480
penetrate another checkpoint again. So that's one point, which, you know, all right, so that's happening,

332
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:17,080
but the meat of the story to me is that apparently they only catch 90% of what is taken through

333
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:27,480
the security checkpoints. The other 10% includes knives, box cutters, baseball bats, bricks, golf clubs,

334
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:37,160
and even ones in the past couple months, a small chain saw. So so much for your fucking security,

335
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,360
you know, all you need is, don't you need just like 1% to go wrong or just one little item,

336
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:51,640
please. Again, I will, I submit that the security at the US airports is there to make us feel safe,

337
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,840
it's horseshit, it doesn't make you any safer. Yeah, you always want to try and get the one whack job,

338
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,680
but essentially it would be much better to create something with winky, blinky lights and

339
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,240
retinal scans and radars and you walk through that with your luggage and, you know, you're then

340
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,200
scanned and, you know, you're approved and then you can go through, which means, of course,

341
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,280
they didn't check anything, but at least you'll feel a lot safer and isn't that what it's all about.

342
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,280
Fine, for the hit test. It's not going to be multiple choice. Every test is multiple choice.

343
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:35,720
With Yon, Poli. Hey, Yon! Hi, Adam. It's time for hit test number 14.

344
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,680
Right, I don't, but it's the 7th, number 13. What do you mean? So, the tricks will be played for you two times.

345
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,320
Okay, and afterwards you get five seconds to think about it. So, are you ready? I don't get my 10 second one.

346
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,720
Yon, Pharnam, you're the boy. Yon, Pharnam, you're the boy. Yon, Pharnam, you're the boy.

347
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,120
Okay, I'm going to stick with my answer. Yon, Pharnam, you're the boys.

348
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,280
What, for number two?

349
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,000
And once again, no idea about it.

350
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,040
I got to give up on that one. And this is number three.

351
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,200
Oh, yeah, I know this one. This song is actually one more time.

352
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,240
That's the first song I played on my first official radio game, Pointer Sisters. He's so shy.

353
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,760
I think. That's my five seconds. It's time for the answer.

354
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:46,040
Answer number one. Yeah. In today's hit test number 14. Yon Pharnam, this is the voice.

355
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:16,040
And the second entry today's hit test. It's name is Cherry. This is inner city mama.

356
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
I never would have guessed that.

357
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,800
I don't remember the song at all. And then it's Cherry sure, but

358
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:41,240
and the final answer. It's an old drag from the Point of Sisters. And he's so shy.

359
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:08,280
And the point of Sisters and he's so shy is answer number three into this hit test.

360
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,960
Well, that's hit feedback. It's welcome. It's hit test at gmail.com and all information about the hit test.

361
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,880
And the new hit test podcast can be found at www.yonfolet.nl.

362
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,080
This G-A-N-B-O-L-E-T-D-S-N-L. Well, I don't see you next time for number 15 of the hit test.

363
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,880
Bye bye. Thank you very much. That was good one. That was good. That was good. Thank you very much. Yonple,

364
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,120
doing the hit test. And well, tomorrow's somewhere tomorrow. Of course, there'll be another podcast.

365
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,480
It's going to be a little tough for us. Well, maybe I'll do one on the plane or something like that.

366
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,560
Oh, by the way, before I forget, I must say we were in the meeting today. The company was

367
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,760
really, really smart people who've been working on their own version of podcasting for quite a while, actually.

368
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:59,160
And so it's in there with like the chief technology officer and a couple other people.

369
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,800
And the door opens and the young lady just folks are head. It's a small company.

370
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,960
Just folks are head around the corner. She says, hey, I just wanted to say hi,

371
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,880
because I listened to the daily source code every single day. So, I'll straight.

372
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:23,480
Keep messing in the roof. It's hard. You drive us wild. We'll drive you crazy.

373
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:34,920
You say you want your first spin. Part is just a double hit. You win. You drive us wild. We'll drive you crazy.

374
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:45,640
You keep shouting. You keep shouting. I want to rock in, roll out now.

375
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,240
And party every day. Yeah.

376
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:56,920
We'll run in roll out now. And party every day. Yeah. We'll run in roll out now.

377
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,280
And party every day. Yeah. We'll run in roll out now.

378
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,240
And party every day.

379
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,560
You keep saying you can drive me wild. You're looking fancy in a light crystal.

380
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,080
And you drive us wild. We'll drive you crazy.

381
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:25,160
And you show us everything you've got. And pay the paper that's quantum rock.

382
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,360
You drive us wild. We'll drive you crazy.

383
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:39,160
You keep shouting. You keep shouting. I want to rock in, roll out now.

384
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,760
And party every day. Yeah! We'll run in roll out now.

385
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,600
And party every day. Yeah. We'll run in roll out now.

386
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,880
And party every day. Yeah! We'll run in roll out now.

387
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,920
And party every day.

388
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:27,160
You give the shadow, you give the shadow

389
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,160
I won't rock it roll out now

390
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:41,160
I won't rock it roll out now

391
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:47,160
I won't rock it roll out now

392
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,160
I won't rock it roll out now

393
00:32:53,160 --> 00:33:02,980
Hey, see Dixie from their album Kiss My Grass, Rockin' Roll and I, of course, you probably

394
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:09,340
recognize that from one of Michael Butler's all-time favorites, Keas.

395
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:16,960
Before I go, I just want to mention that I stand corrected in the previous podcast, I spoke

396
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:26,120
about helicopter pilots, not smoking, and Hugh, Hugh Adonnell sent me three pictures

397
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:33,200
no less, it must be a collector of cockpit pictures, three different helicopters, each

398
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,900
of which contains an astray, so there's the aerospatial, a Spasial 355, which is like the

399
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:46,540
euro, it's like the big asturocopter helicopter, nice, the last tray there, neatly positioned

400
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:53,340
on the left hand side, by the way, that's the passenger side, I think, in the French helicopter.

401
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,580
Then there's a Bell 206, which looks like it's astray, is located right in the middle

402
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,980
of the console, or wait a minute, is that I can't really tell what that is, and then there's

403
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:12,580
also a bull-cove, which is a very popular helicopter for police and trauma use, and they

404
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,540
also have an astray, right, and you know what?

405
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:25,500
All of these astrays look used, maybe I just need a new machine, yeah, that's a show, a little

406
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,300
bit shorter than normal, but time for you to hit the hay off to Seattle tomorrow morning,

407
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,620
and somewhere in the evening we'll be back with another daily source code, and I'll tell

408
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:40,100
you all about the days of MCs, as usual, it's Adam and Curry.com, and all the archives

409
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:46,100
in the latest show at Daily Source Code.com.

410
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,740
Weblog is www.curry.com, leave a comment there, I still haven't had time to clean out my entry

411
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,380
through feedback, Gmail, e-box, I'm probably going to wait to do that until I get back

412
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,700
home to go for it, and by the way, going home Friday, which means I'll be back with my

413
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:06,780
two girls Saturday morning looking forward to it, it's been a lot of fun, but it was like a big

414
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,660
road trip, okay, take care everybody, have a great day, and I'll talk to you tomorrow, bye-bye.
