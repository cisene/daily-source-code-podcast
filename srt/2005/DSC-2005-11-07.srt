1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-7-5

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Please save me from people who've been told what to like and then like it.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
In my opinion, if you're over six years of age and you're still getting your music from the radio,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,500
something is desperately wrong with you.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,000
I can only hope that somehow MP3 players and file sharing will destroy FM radio

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the way they're destroying record companies.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then, even though the air will probably never be safe to breathe again,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
maybe it will be safer to listen to.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Good afternoon everybody, coming to you from Brussels.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's right.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
An undisclosed hotel in Brussels in Belgium.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is the daily source code for Monday, November 7th, 2005.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As you can tell, I do not have the Yamaha Mega Workstation with me.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I just had to throw some stuff together.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I basically pulled out whatever it's fitting a small suitcase for my two-day quick travel

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
to visit the European Parliament and a couple members of Parliament.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
About some serious issues, some things that took place Friday and over the weekend

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that we got to talk about.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And what better than this is kind of like pulp fiction like music from a brain bucket.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Which I found on the pod save music network.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is a buy-out something.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Anyway, wow, where to start?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think the best place to start for today is kind of a spin it back to Friday.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now, sometimes there is just no coincidence in life.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But for the past couple of weeks, actually for the past year or so,

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
we've been talking about music rights and how performance rights work versus mechanical rights

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
versus publishing rights and how we can use license music in podcasts.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And I think we pretty much determined that it wasn't going to work on a short term.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And now some events took place this past Friday and a little bit over the weekend

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that made me realize that it's definitely not going to happen.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But it gets a little bit worse than just that.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So having grown up in the Netherlands moved there when I was seven.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And of course, there was like a 15-year period when Patricia and I went back to the states.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But we've been back.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We were back just at the end of 1999 and stayed there until a year ago.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We moved here, but we moved to the cottage in the UK.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I'm a very familiar with it's a small country, right?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, man.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I did it.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I did a valley wood.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I said, right.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
After my myself to find myself for that.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a very small country.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And Patricia and I were both very well known there.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And there's just a lot of activity around us.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So people are very aware usually what we're doing in podcasting of course is no different.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Since it was basically developed partially in the Netherlands.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was writing the iPodder script during the decompression hour of my morning radio show

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
for Veronica Radio, which I did for a year in the Netherlands.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I would drive from the castle up and back every day.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You probably remember some of that if you've been listening for a while.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And of course it was further developed at the cottage in Belgium.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So podcasting, although it really caught on first in the states and probably about six months ago

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the Dutch press caught up and started to talk about it a little bit more.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The conversation about playing licensed music on podcast took a very interesting turn.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Probably about that must have been about six months ago.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When the Dutch version of Ask Have Be Am I, who of course affiliated the Buma Stemera,

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
said that podcasters, non-commercial podcasters could obtain a 35 euro month license

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and play whatever they wanted on their podcast.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
At least that was the way it was construed.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I never quite read it that way.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I thought it's still meant that you had to have permission from the owner of the masters themselves

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to play it on a podcast.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hold on, I'm just having a sip of, unfortunately, my favorite coffee.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And one of those coffee makers in the corner hall.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I missed the froth.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So unbelievably, last Friday the message is started to come in that the Dutch version of the RIA, which is the NVPI,

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
decided that they were not going to go along with us.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Didn't like the idea there was going to be no test.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The only way they will work with people and license music with podcasts is if podcasters

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
DRM their podcast, which of course, I mean, what a can of worms that is we can't even get

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
iTunes songs on different devices.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So I think that's the last place we want to go.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But they're very adamant about it.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now, you have to know something else about the Netherlands and how it works there.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hold on a second.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let me just stop this.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Bring buckets almost over and I don't want to go to the next song just yet.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Something else you need to know about.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, boy, I have a little too much reverb there.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, well, it's the multi-effects box that I brought along.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't want to mess with it.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I got to get this story to you.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So something you need to know about broadcasting in the Netherlands.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And in many other countries around the world, unlike the United States.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think even in the UK, you purchase a license for, let's just keep with the radio for a moment here.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And let's keep it with the Netherlands because this is where the issues are coming from.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You purchase a license to use the frequency.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And you purchase that.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Actually, it's done in an auction.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Every, I think it's, they've done two auctions now.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is the second auction in 10 years.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I think that's what it was.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But most of the time these frequencies are auctioned off.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Just like cell phone frequencies are auctioned off.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And they're auctioned off to the highest, usually to the highest bidder.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And some radio stations are paying up to 10 million euros.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So call that, what is that?

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's probably like 11 or 12 million dollars.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Like 11 million dollars a year.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Just for the privilege of using the frequency.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You don't actually get a transmitter or an antenna or even two-tain cans in a string for that price.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And of course, depending on your coverage, depending on the actual frequency,

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
if the middle of the band is sometimes more,

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
it can be more useful than the side bands.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know, there's all these different parameters that play along.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And so, you know, the smaller stations are playing,

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
still paying up to a million, I think,

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
anywhere from half to a million euros a year.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Just to use it.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Now, what is the USP, the unique selling proposition of these broadcasters?

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, 90% of all broadcasts, radio broadcasts,

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and the Netherlands are music-based.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There is an all-new station and they have it segregated.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In fact, they've done it so trickily.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So it's very intricate, actually.

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can purchase a cheaper license,

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
but then you may not be able to play songs from the 90s and today.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can only play 50s and 60s and 70s or 70s, 80s and 90s.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And then there's how much talk versus music and how much news you have to bring.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And so there's all these stipulations.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a very, very messed up system.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not really a free way of operating.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And it doesn't really give for good competition,

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
because you're competing, you know, well, forget about it.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So the main point is that there is a fee that has to be paid.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And so the USP is being able to play licensed music.

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So there's not just an issue with the record companies in the Netherlands.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And again, this is something that is very common amongst other European countries,

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
other countries in the world.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There's, so there's a big disconnect between what we're doing on podcasting.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And what's happening in the music business and what's happening in broadcasting.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But it must be very clear that it behooves both, obviously, the record companies,

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
because they do not believe in the power of promotion of a podcast.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They think that because we're playing or if someone played licensed music on a podcast,

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that it would actually, would detract from record sales.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now, you all know that I believe very different from that.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now, the, the broadcasters, they only have that music,

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
that licensed music as their USP.

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In fact, the backlog is in many, many instances, very, very important.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So think about, you know, the kind of music that I use in backtracks,

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
or that is, that I play, that is used in, and produced in backtracks.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And the, the hit test that young poet does.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And that's a lot of backlog.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So basically, I got a phone call.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, actually, it wasn't just a phone call, but it was more, more than one means of communication.

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
From more than one representative, or people who I deemed to be representative,

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
of both the music business and broadcasting in the Netherlands.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And I was told, maybe I should say, well, threatened wouldn't be the right word.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But I think, promised probably would be a better word, that these organizations,

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the broadcasters, particularly the commercial broadcasters, who are very,

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
very sue happy in the Netherlands.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
They sue each other all the time.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They sue the government over their licenses.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, if someone plays a song from the wrong era that doesn't belong to their license,

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
they go out and sue that station.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And they go through the government again.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And it's just a very, and believe me, you do not want to be in the Dutch legal system.

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Certainly not on the, on the being sued side.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not fun.

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Very lengthy.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And they have no, it's a professional judge system.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They have no jury.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So eventually some guy or gal is going to decide your fate.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Not a jury of your peers.

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So the promise that was made is that they're going to come after podcasters.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And they're going to shut them down.

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now, what was implied, but what wasn't said implicitly, was that they were going to shut podcasting down.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Many of you may have wondered how come there are several episodes of daily source,

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
that you can't find in the archives.

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So maybe it's time for me to tell you why throughout the past year,

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I had received notices from certain organizations.

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Again, these would be a Dutch, local Dutch chapters of international organizations

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that would say, hey, you have licensed music sitting on your server.

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Here's the file.

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And they typically would point to a daily source code.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Now, of course, a year back, I was certainly playing licensed music.

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I would just remove it and I didn't make a big deal out of it,

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
because I just wanted to keep podcasting rolling on.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The last thing we need is the RIA and Ask Cap or BMI or Harry Fox,

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
or the NVPI or Sainat or C-SAC or PRM, all this PRS,

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
PMS, we do not want these guys descending on us and just making trouble,

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
because we're doing so well.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And we do have an alternative, of course, which is pod save music.

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So here's what I did.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And I did not take this quote, Promise, lightly at all.

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I even went, so this is the severity of what it meant to me.

192
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I actually removed every single MP3.

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I could find anywhere on a hard drive in my house.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So anything that was not, I probably even threw away a couple of songs

195
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
licensed through iTunes and music store.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But I just took everything out, got it off my hard drives.

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You know, I archived it and the disk is safe.

198
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We're, you know, no one will find that.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So that won't be a violation, but I just took everything off.

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And in fact, I've been enjoying pod save music all weekend.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Excuse me.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Cheap ass coffee and Brussels hotel room.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh.

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I'm not taking this, this lightly.

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I happen to know a couple of people in the European Parliament.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Because what happens is, if the Dutch organizations go after this,

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and it's very easy to get, to get lost past in the Netherlands,

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the way the structure is.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And, you know, just the way the old boys network functions.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That this could become a European directive before you know it.

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It could just happen overnight.

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So I want to see, you know, what, what can be done,

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
what kind of rights there are.

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But one thing I do know for sure, it's over.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There's no, I'm not going to be playing anymore licensed music.

216
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If it's not registered through the pod safe music network,

217
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
which is a very clear agreement.

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Once the podcaster signs up, once the artist signs up,

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
then, you know, you can feel reasonably safe

220
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that anything you're playing there is going to work

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and is going to be deemed pod safe.

222
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So even though I, and it really hurts, man,

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
because no more mashups, it just, I can't do it.

224
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Because how much fun would it be for a couple of bullshit organizations

225
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to come after me and make a huge example out of me?

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I think it would be way too much fun for those guys.

227
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So I don't want to give them that pleasure.

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm going 100% pod safe from this moment on.

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And we'll keep you abreast of what's what I find out here in Brussels.

230
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think I pretty sure, I know what I'm going to hear.

231
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I just want to see how fast it could spread.

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What, how fast the directive can be put in place.

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because we do have some transitioning to make.

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I think everyone should be really aware of what's coming down.

235
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And it, you know, it makes a lot of sense.

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And thinking about what could happen.

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And I think that we're just on the edge of that place.

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So pod safe from now on, my friends, 100%.

239
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And I couldn't think of a better song to kick off my proud to be pod safe

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
edition of the Delta Sierra Charlie than monk.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The pod people.

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I think we're really free.

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But maybe we're not doing it.

244
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We're going to sing up the beat.

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
To be in the right to me.

246
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If everything I need, better than the old dead frequency.

247
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
From underground, hold down the sound.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Come set the fire, burn the old dial.

249
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
A China's now.

250
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You are never alone.

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
All I know is a drum, can't stand the throttle.

252
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:52,000
All I know is a drum.

253
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You've been part of the bomb.

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm looking like people taking it away from us

255
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
In visions coming closer

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm looking like people taking it away

257
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We're in control

258
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Everywhere you go

259
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Once we start to blow your in the middle

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Like the blue sea and show

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You can't stop the blue

262
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Suck away the green

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Break down the beach

264
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The parade for free

265
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Kill the radio crew

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You are never known

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
All I know is a grown

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Can't stand a daughter

269
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Of all the anxiety

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And you have wasted

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You've been born in the mind

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Same with all you men show

273
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You can't stop the blue sea

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And you have wasted

275
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm looking like people taking it away from us

276
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm looking like people taking it away from us

00:18:41,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

307
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, chis-mm, good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, às-rr, yeah!, yeah. yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

308
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,600
You better believe it. You can come after us, but we're here to make you irrelevant. That's right

309
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:54,760
So speak of the devil RIA makes a land grab. This is sent to me by

310
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,200
A non-E mouse and that makes sense that someone sent it to me anonymously

311
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,400
Let me just share this with you. Hey Adam, I might be interested in this although it's not directly related to podcasting

312
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,600
It might be indicative as to the state of the mind the RIA is currently operating under

313
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,640
So this is the American counterpart of the of the Dutch guys who made that a little promise to me

314
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
So he sends a link here it is

315
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,680
They've asked all webcasters so this falls under the

316
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Man bad Russell's coffee

317
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,440
This falls under the I guess the digital millennium copyright act

318
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Usually webcasters do but anyway

319
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,880
They have asked all webcasters to agree to paying

320
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,880
More than one third of their revenue or two point three times with their currently play a

321
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,640
Paying for playing RIA controlled music online

322
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,240
As you mentioned previously, I work for a small media

323
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,240
As mentioned previously, I work for a small media conglomerate and I can tell you we don't make hardly anything

324
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Off of streaming online

325
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,400
The insider to the negotiations that I've spoken with seem to think that basically the RIA is running scared

326
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,360
Yeah, no shit. They're argument asking for these exorbitant rates is that anybody can now find any song they want online at any given moment

327
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,840
And can use something like audio hijack pro to get a CD quality copy of any song they want

328
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Oh, man, these guys do not understand it. They're for an order to make up for the lost revenue in CD sales

329
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,680
They need to jack up the prices to the middle man

330
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
So then he goes on to say that obviously

331
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,960
This elbows out the middle man. So what does this mean for podcasts or thing? It means mostly that it seems quite unlike you

332
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,960
There'll be any reasonably priced license for including RIA protect it song at any time in the foreseeable future. Yeah, no shit

333
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,920
So there you go. It's happening in the states now to with the RIA so

334
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,200
And now we got to be really careful because

335
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,080
Don't try to do things under fair use just if you if you when in doubt

336
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Kick it out. That's what I say

337
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:03,160
If you're using some kind of you know a bit from a CD that you used for an opener or for a tune for your show

338
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,680
Get rid of it. You don't want to run any risk. You can find lots of stuff on the pod safe music network

339
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,840
Wow, this is gonna be pretty interesting. So I'm kind of you know, I mean a new year

340
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,960
I'm in flux man because one on one hand. I'm like

341
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,400
God this is so stupid. I can't believe it. Why don't they understand that this is not the way to go about it

342
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,160
On the other hand. I'm like screw that the pod people are here, baby

343
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
This week on the squad cast

344
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:39,960
He's taken double the fucking dosage a bite get it. Well, that's because the last bottle that I had it was is said to take a table spoon

345
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,440
So and what did this say? Well, I didn't read the directs that I assume this was the same and then I looked you know

346
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,080
Then I've all of a sudden. I'm like, oh, it's probably the same and

347
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Fucking balloon head

348
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
What is on the bottle?

349
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:59,720
So if you on two million dollar if you take the cash pay out which I always did you walk home with seven hundred and seventy thousand

350
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,560
Oh, he's dead how many times you went? Yeah, yeah

351
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,480
What's that you said that you always did as if you won repeatedly on the lottery. Oh, no

352
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
That's the hang on her

353
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,120
He can his ugly hand

354
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,880
Anthony. Yeah, what did a noise shit out of you Brian ice cream really loud?

355
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Yeah

356
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
I was only kidding, but there you go

357
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480

Squad cast a Gmail dot com squad cast squad cast dot com yeah, I'm Mrs. B here. I was just listening to daily source code number 272

359

and you were talking today about

360
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,960
Football fans in Europe having podcasts and that there's not much of a voice of the fan out there

361
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:53,560
Well, that applies to American football too, but guess what? I do have American football podcast and it's a Patriots podcast

362
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,120
And I've been going out at since some training camp this summer. I attended training camp every day

363
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,440
And I've been I did something towards and I'm continuing on through the season so

373
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400

Thanks, so what do you think you can find me at www.patiateworld.com and I go to our waggames as well

386
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,920
I've been to a couple already this year I'm heading out to Miami

387
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,920
Next week while all of you guys will be at the portable media expo. I would have left to go there too

388
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
I already had these plans and

389
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,120
So I think it also falls under that category of regional

390
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,880
Podcasts too. You talked about that a couple days back and how does the niche for certain

391
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,240
Certain podcasts and certain regions and although

392
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:53,080
The Patriots are the New England Patriots Patriot Nation extends far beyond the borders of New England

393
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,160
There's Patriot fans all over the world. So if any of the listeners out there I want to jump on and and live

394
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,760
Vicariously through the season ticket hold as eyes ears and taste buds

395
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,480
Jump on over to Mrs. B's Patriot World podcast. Go

396
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,960
Hi, this is Allison Sheridan with the New Silicast podcast hosted at podfeet.com

397
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:20,200
I wanted to tell you about my podcast. It's a technology geek podcast with a slight Macintosh bias

398
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,440
I just love technology. I love to talk about it. I love to to read about it. I love to play with it

399
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,040
I love to do anything to find new tools that are gonna solve problems that we all have

400
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,360
I like to teach other people how to use tools. I just love technology

401
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,760
It's what I play with all day at work and all day at home

402
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,320
Just really really get a big kick out of it. So I thought if I was having that much fun with it

403
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,120
Why not do a podcast and get other people excited about it too?

404
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:52,440
I like freeware and shareware best of all. That's my favorite thing in the world anybody can send me a link and say here

405
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,240
Try this and all load it. It's kind of like hey Mikey. He'll try anything. I'll try any piece of software

406
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,760
You send me just to see what it does. I don't care what it does my operating system. Let's just find out do some experimentation

407
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:10,360
I've got listeners from 24 countries already and so I'm hoping that I'm inspiring people enjoy technology as much as I do

408
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:19,560
Why don't you head over to podfeed.com and check out the no-silicate podcast. Yeah, right home. I love playing with playing with it too as much as I can

409
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,360
So my new setup clearly does not block Skype from ringing through

410
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,400
That was kind of interesting Skype went off then I rejected it and then two seconds later

411
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,960
My cell phone rang because I forgot that I have Skype forward into my cell phone

412
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,600
My goodness so that's just stay off for now now. All righty that was kind of that the

413
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,320
That pat New England Patriots podcast man that promo was long

414
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,520
Hey, let's try to keep promos under 10 minutes if we can

415
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,320
Oh wow so a little depressing here the weather is really crap in in Brussels

416
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:03,400
And by the way the parliament moves back and forth between Brussels and Luxembourg so the idea is is to go to Luxembourg tomorrow because there's a

417
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Basically the people that I want to talk to are split up

418
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,160
But I'm I'm pretty sure I know what I'm gonna hear and by the way this is not like it's like it's a

419
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,280
A huge punishment for me to do this because you know that when you make those little hops in inside Europe

420
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,760
You don't really get on an easy jet if you have

421
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,920
The Charlie 182 Romeo Gulf you know what I'm saying

Do you wanna get mad?

433
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,520
Enough to make the phone listen

434
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,300
on a podcast and makes you wanna move?

435
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,900
I'm hurting you down, skinny white boy

436
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,300
Four and one and a job, oh please a trick I chose

437
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
It makes you wanna move

438
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,300
Get it out, mix it in, mash it up, get on down

439
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Get it out, mix it in, mash it up, get on down

Get it out, mix it in, mash it up, get on down

Get it out, mix it in, mash it up, get on down

445
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,300
Get it out, mix it in, mash it up, get on down

446
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,300
What do you see? You can't always believe

447
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,300
But you gotta have faith, and you know that ain't free

448
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm on the foot, it's got a huge house

449
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Why not buy a song?

450
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,300
I'm just gonna die, you can sing it alone

451
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,300
But you see, you can't always believe

452
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,300
But you gotta have faith, and you know that ain't free

453
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,300
I'm on the foot, it's got a huge house

454
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Why not buy a song?

455
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:19,300
I'm on my foot, it's wrapped up in the cord

456
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,300
Josh Cruz, mash it up, it's the title that one

457
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,300
I said premiere, it's a premiere on the daily source code

458
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,300
That's for sure, maybe CCC Chapman played it, that wouldn't surprise me

459
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,300
I haven't listened to the latest pod show music rewind

460
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Which I think it's number eight came out, no maybe seven, seven or eight

461
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,300
Oh man, if you haven't heard that definitely go to music.podshow.com

462
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,300
There's a link to it right there on the homepage these days

463
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,300
So still working on that Christmas song, a slow is communicating with the

464
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Ronald Treiber in the Netherlands and they're working on coordinating

465
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,300
Getting some artists, I guess, actually into a studio in New York

466
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Some of the New York guys and gals

467
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,300
And hopefully they're gonna have other stuff sent through the net

468
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
That was kind of the whole point of the experiment

469
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,300
To see if we could get a whole bunch of pod music artists sending in their submissions

470
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,300
And basically syncing them up, I have no idea how that's gonna work

471
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Technically, but looks like one big pro tools project to me

472
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,300
And CCC Chapman is now kind of coordinating that

473
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,300
So I'm so happy that all I had to do is just hand off the idea

474
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
I don't actually have to do anything

475
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
But the minute there's something I can listen to guys

476
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Maybe you got some session tracks or something, please send it off to the source code

477
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
So I can let everybody enjoy it

478
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,300
And of course, I got a whole bunch of comments about me talking about Christmas

479
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
In many aspects

480
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Hi Adam, this is Brent from mac and rollpodcast.com

00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,300
What's the fucking deal of playing Christmas music the first week of November

482
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,300
You're getting as bad as Walmart and Target

483
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
What next Christmas tree websites

484
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,300
And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I've ever heard a death metal band

485
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,300
When the pot safe music network on the daily source code

486
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Like you think death metal artists don't have feelings too

487
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:12,300
I think they'd go over great on your Christmas song collaboration

488
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,300
So don't forget the death metal artists

489
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Keep talking to Adam

490
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Hi Adam, it's Glenia from the Zedesh pot cost

491
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Down here in Cape Town, South Africa

492
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Or as you yanks are called at the Zesesh

493
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Well it's early November

494
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,300
But you know has you know time flies and we're heading towards Christmas time

495
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,300
And one thing that really piss me off the most

496
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,300
is when I turn on the TV and I look at foreign media

497
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,300
The phrases like happy Christmas, merry Christmas

498
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Have a great new year

499
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Or whatever, you know people use to express

500
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,300
You know good wishes and good wealth of Christmas

501
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Or it's been replaced by two words

502
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,300
One phrase, happy holidays

503
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I think this is a lot of politically correct bullshit

504
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
That we have to endure during this time of year

505
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Where we all come together and we all close and family

506
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,300
And all those good things that form part of the Christmas spirit

507
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
I would like to ask all pot-casters

508
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
Are there please refrain from using happy holidays

509
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Please express yourself the way you should be expressing yourself during this time of year

510
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,300
So if you're in a religion that celebrates Christmas

511
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Same merry Christmas on a happy new year

512
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
And I hope you have a great 2006

513
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
If you're Jewish, well happy on a cold

514
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,300
And if you're anything else that celebrates this time of year

515
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
And a different way, express yourself

516
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Come on guys, stop letting the foreign media

517
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
And all the politically correct bullshit

518
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
Interfere in your Christmas time

519
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
And secondly, I thought I'd plug my own show

520
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,300
You can listen to the Zerez Show podcast

521
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,300
Probably one of a handful of podcasts coming from Cape Town, South Africa

522
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
Well yeah, we talk about all things South African

523
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
It may be news interviews

524
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Sensing tours and of course we try our best to play the very best in South African music

525
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Oh, and another thing

526
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
We've also been making some bolt-on

527
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Which is the South African delicacy

528
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,300
A spiced dry meat

529
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,300
And no, it is not like that horseshoe

530
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,300
You guys call beef jerky up there in the US

531
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
So come on subscribe to the Zerez Show

And of course don't forget

536
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Zed in South Africa is pronounced as Z in the US

537
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
Well until then, thanks Adam

538
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Bye bye

539
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Thanks Glenn

540
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
Now you make a good point there

541
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,300
Patricia now we're just talking about that

542
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,300
About right now how beautiful a Guilford is

543
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,300
And it's a holiday spirit

544
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,300
I think the I think what we should do

545
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
As responsible podcasts

546
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,300
I'm going to make it my business to find out

547
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
And usually I do actually

548
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Find out what the exact dates of some other holidays are

549
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
So I can say happy Hanukkah

550
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,300
And what else there must be other things you say at Hanukkah

551
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
I know that

552
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
Around young Kippur Jewish New Year

553
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
You say Shrenatova

554
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
And then of course there's Kwanza

555
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,300
So maybe we just

556
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
And how can we don't have

557
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,300
Shopping season for Kwanza

558
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,300
And for Hanukkah and for Ramadan

559
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,300
And what else you might have

560
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,300
You know I think it's a commercial opportunity

561
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
There's not a

562
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Maybe we should start with Ramadan

563
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
I'm telling you that's like a month worth of partying

564
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
Ah

565
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Oh well

566
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
Yeah I kind of agree with that

567
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Political politically correct

568
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Happy holidays

569
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Oh please

570
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
Please

571
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,300
And of course that means that we should also have a

572
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,300
A pod safe

573
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Happy Hanukkah song and happy Kwanza song

574
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,300
I'm all for it

575
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Send it in just send it into me

576
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,300
And I did a request

577
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,300
Last week for some creative ideas about

578
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
New types of advertising

579
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
And I received a couple of entries

580
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,300
I want to play 140 right now

581
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Which I like very much

582
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Although it wasn't really a new way of advertising

583
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
But it was actually it was kind of

584
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
It was very creative

585
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
And it's not 30 seconds jammed into your face

586
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,300
Here listen to this with me

587
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,300
I think you'll enjoy it

588
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Hi Adam

589
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,300
It's Ron from Griddlekakes Radio

590
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Where we explore the last art of

591
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Audio Storytelling

592
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
Check us out at griddlekakes.com

593
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
Just like you

594
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
I'm a big

595
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
So we decided to take you up on your quest

596
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
For an eye dot commercial

597
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,300
And delivered it to you

598
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
Griddlekakes style

599
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
Take a listen

600
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,300
Here you go sweetheart

601
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Happy birthday

602
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Hmm

603
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
The box is bigger than I thought

604
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Oh, what's this?

605
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
It's a puppy silly

606
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,300
Isn't that what you wanted?

607
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,300
Well dad

608
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
I wanted an eye dog

609
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,300
I know but isn't a puppy much better than an eye dog

610
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,300
Can he make his head light up?

611
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,300
Well no

612
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,300
If I plug him in on my eye pot

613
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,300
Will he play music?

614
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
No sweetheart

615
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Can he dance to my music?

616
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Maybe in time

617
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
I just thought

618
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
I'm just think about all the things

619
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,300
We won't have to do with an eye dog

620
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,300
We won't have to feed him

621
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,300
We won't have to clean up after him

622
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,300
We won't have to get him

623
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,300
Since the dawn of time

624
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Dogs have held the title man's best friend

625
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
But not anymore

626
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,300
As children around the world

627
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,300
Choosing a cute little pooch with a pinched from music

628
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,300
Called Eye Dogs

629
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,300
And we'll never have to take ticks off of him

630
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
Oh look honey

631
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,300
He's trying to moonwalk

632
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
Oh hum

633
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
Boring

634
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
Um

635
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,300
Dad

636
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,300
What's he doing now?

637
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
I don't know

638
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,300
I think he's trying to plug himself into the stereo

639
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
No

640
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,300
And Eye Dogs run on batteries

641
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,300
And I can carry him in his eye doggy bag

642
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
And I can take him with me

643
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,300
And I can dress him up in this cute little sweater

644
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Called a chill set

645
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,300
And he's allowed to stay in home

646
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,300
Come here boys

647
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
Are you alright?

648
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
Eye dog

649
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,300
Man's new best friend

650
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Okay

651
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,300
I don't know if we could ever use it more than once

652
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,300
I might try and see if I can get away with it

653
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
But I like it very much

654
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
Very, very cool

655
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,300
Um

656
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,300
You know what?

657
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Tell me your address

658
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,300
And I'll send you an eye dog

659
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,300
If I'm sure we have one lane right

660
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,300
If not we'll just grab the one that belongs to

661
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,300
Chris McIntyre from podcast alley

662
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
We'll steal his eye dog

663
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
Alrighty

664
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,300
How wild this is so weird

665
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
The sound is completely different

666
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,300
I think I might have a

667
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,300
I see this is my old soundcraft mixing board

668
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
It has the

669
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Let me just tell you what I have set up

670
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,300
Because I've been doing a little bit of experimentation

671
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
With mobile setup

672
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
I brought out the...

673
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,300
So I have to say that for short trips

674
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Schlepping along the Yamaha digital

675
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
Workstation, the 16

676
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,300
Alfa whiskey, whatever it is

677
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,300
It's just way too much

678
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
Of course, what I really need

679
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,300
Is any of the great Mike Priam

680
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
Something that makes the microphone sound good

681
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,300
Like having a little bit of reverb

682
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
I think I have too much

683
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
But I just have to live with it

684
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
And a compressor

685
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
And I have from my previous setup

686
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,300
I have this, what does this say?

687
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Let me see

688
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
What kind of unit?

689
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
It's a cheap ass one

690
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,300
It's the TC electronic

691
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Does it have a name on it?

692
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,300
I can't even read him

693
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,300
So freaking blind

694
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,300
The dual

695
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
Engine processor

696
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,300
The M300

697
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
Okay

698
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,300
So I've basically routed

699
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,300
The signal out of the new power book

700
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,300
Into a channel there

701
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,300
I have the mic just plugged in up on top

702
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,300
And it all runs through the same reverb

703
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,300
And processor

704
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Sounds okay I guess

705
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,300
It's better than the live mic

706
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Oh by the way, I can also put the live mic on it

707
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,300
So once I get the sound a little bit better

708
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,300
And I'll have to work on that

709
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,300
And tweak it

710
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
This will be a great mobile setup

711
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,300
Because it's a much more compact

712
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,300
Than the Yamaha

713
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,300
Man

714
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
I'm also sitting on the ground

715
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
I have all the equipment

716
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,300
Strow now

717
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,300
You know I like to stand

718
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,300
When I'm working

719
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,300
And I don't get as much gastronol interruptions

720
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,300
So I have my back leans

721
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,300
The lean the lean against the bed

722
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,300
Here on the carpet

723
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,300
Which kind of grosses me out

724
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,300
The carpet of the hotel room

725
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,300
Who knows what

726
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,300
Euro Parliamentarian

727
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,300
Been walking around here with a wet damp feet

728
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,300
From the shower

729
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Ooh

730
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,300
Freaky man

731
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,300
Just freak out of him

732
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,300
This is Thomas from Germany

733
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,300
Hey Thomas

734
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,300
I'm a regular listener since about two months

735
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
I'm really enjoying what you do

736
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,300
In fact, your show is just about the only podcast

737
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,300
I have the time to listen to on a regular basis

738
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,300
It seems to cover a lot of what I've interested in

739
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,300
Music, political aspects of the music business

740
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,300
Geeky stuff

741
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
Apple porn

742
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,300
You know, you've talked about German reggae music

743
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,300
And one or two of the last shows

744
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Reggae, especially German reggae, is extremely popular over here

745
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,300
I'm sure you must have heard about seed

746
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,300
A band from Berlin

747
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,300
They have a huge hit at the moment called Aufstein

748
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,300
I think there are also popular in Jamaica

749
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Which goes to show that music really is a universal

750
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,300
Border crossing phenomenon

751
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,300
It's also refreshing to see you know

752
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,300
The young folk listening to some proper music for a change

753
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
I know

754
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,300
That music is not part-save

755
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,300
But I think you're not wanting to miss this really, really cool

756
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,300
But pumping kick ass reggae

757
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,300
Which, by the way, also has some very cool lyrics

758
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,300
You might even understand most of it

759
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,300
Since they're singing in German as well as English

760
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,300
Don't miss him

761
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,300
Okay Adam, that's all from me

762
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,300
Keep up the good work

763
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,300
I wish you all the best

764
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,300
Bye

765
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,300
Dude, Thomas, thanks

766
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,300
But there's just no way, man

767
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,300
I cannot play it

768
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,300
It's not pod-save as you already pointed out

769
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,300
I played it, so that was an illegal transfer

770
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,300
I played it, I listened to it

771
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,300
I liked it very much

772
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,300
Seed with Triple E

773
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
And I immediately deleted it

774
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,300
Because

775
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,300
No more risk

776
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,300
Proud to be pod-save here on Delta Sierra Charlie

777
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
275

778
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,300
This one's just been haunting me

779
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,300
As I listened to it on my iTunes

780
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,300
Bob Gentry's upside down

781
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,300
I've been talking in my past sleep

782
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,300
When I'm waking

783
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,300
Well, my tongue is tight

784
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,300
I've been thinking I should leave

785
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,300
Instead of waiting for her when the time is right

786
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,300
I've backed the bags under my eyes

787
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,300
Well, I've seen enough to know what it's like

788
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,300
It's turning me upside down

789
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,300
Tell me what I've done wrong now

790
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,300
All I can do is try it

791
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,300
When everything's breaking me down

792
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,300
Looking at the end side out

793
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,300
Well, those rules got changed somehow

794
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,300
Maybe it's suicide

795
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,300
To stay here and just sit around

796
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,300
I was able to hide every bruise on my body

797
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
Till now

798
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,300
Till now

799
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,300
I've been walking in my head

800
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Sleep

801
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,300
When I'm waking up

802
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,300
Well, my legs are tight

803
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,300
I've been thinking I should leave

804
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,300
For the window of it's a marathon

805
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,300
I've been dreaming I could fly it

806
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,300
Well, I'm free enough

807
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,300
But I'm still way down

808
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,300
Just turning me upside down

809
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,300
Tell me what I've done wrong now

810
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,300
All I can do is try it

811
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,300
When everything's breaking me down

812
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,300
Looking at the end side out

813
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,300
Well, those rules got changed somehow

814
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,300
Maybe it's suicide

815
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,300
To stay here and just sit around

00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,300
I was able to hide every bruise on my body

817
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,300
Till now

818
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,300
I've been afraid to just walk out

819
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,300
Ain't nowhere to stop me now

820
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,300
Just turning me upside down

821
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Tell me what I've done wrong now

822
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,300
All I can do is try it

Well, those rules got changed somehow

826
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,300
Maybe it's suicide

827
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,300

Tell me what I've done wrong now

832
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,300
All I can do is try it

833
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,300
When all rules got changed somehow

834
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,300
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now

835
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,300
All I can do is try it

836
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:28,300
Oh man, I love that song

837
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
Despite the skipping

838
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,300
The audio hijacked pro and mega Sega produced

839
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,300
Well worth the price of admission

840
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,300
Pot say find that a music.podshow.com

841
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,300
Bob Gentry upside down

842
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,300
As the final sounds for today's daily source code

843
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,300
Which means we'll be back with you tomorrow

844
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,300
It'll be from Luxembourg

845
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,300
And I'll have hopefully have some more to report

846
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,300
And we're still proud to be

847
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,300
Pot say

848
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,300
Another Pot show podcast

849
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,300
Stick it in your ear

850
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,300
Thanks for watching
