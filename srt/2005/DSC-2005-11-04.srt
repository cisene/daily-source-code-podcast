Adam Curry

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000

Let's get it on!

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,560
And five good afternoon from Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Gilford, Surrey in the United Kingdom

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,560
It's three p.m. even later than yesterday

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,320
Probably the latest have done in the last no wait a minute. That's not true when I'm in the West Coast

97
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,320
It's about this time that I actually even haven't even started thinking about the show

98
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,080
So not bad. Hey, I'm ready for a party. I got we got all kinds of great stuff happening today reason to celebrate

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,520
I won't tell you exactly why but if you've seen Curry dot com if you've seen the weblog

100
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,680
By the time that this is recorded then you probably have an inkling of an idea and

101
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,680
The lovely Patricia will be by today to join our show so

102
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,800
Everyone who's written in and told me that the show is so much better with her. There you go

103
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,080
It's interactive radio my friends. Lots of stuff going on in the email

104
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:45,240
First of all I played that Christmas song by slow which is pod safe and my thought was it's to create a kind of like a

105
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
We are the world band-aid type of project

106
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,600
Having a different pod safe music artists different members of the network participating and then kind of you know putting that whole thing together

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,040
And it seems that slow is now gotten in touch with

108
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,040
Ronald Treiber who's a good friend of mine in the Netherlands, or actually an award-winning sound engineer

109
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,240
And they've got CC Chapman in the loop now as I'm seeing on email

110
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,520
So this is gonna be this is gonna be awesome any the email that slow starts off with it says hey guys

111
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,360
It'll be a Christmas miracle of this thing works out and the the title of that song is a if every day

112
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,640
We're Christmas so we'll see if if we actually get a done but I have a feeling that we can so it's so like a big

113
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,280
Multi-track type of thing. It's more like a

114
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
Social experiment to see if we can actually produce a record all

115
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Online without ever having met each other and you know basically sending tracks back and forth and mixing it all together

116
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,880
And if anyone can do it these guys can so I'm really looking forward to that. That's gonna be very very cool

117
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
See as a comment on bio diesel

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,280
I'll have to talk about that later because that pertains kind of to the celebratory stuff. We have to talk about and of course yesterday

119
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
I said BST

120
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,120
stood for British standard time, which of course was incorrect a dream peg

121
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,360
Corrects me saying no, of course you meant British summer time not British standard time

122
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,960
Summer time came to an end last weekend when the clocks went back an hour

123
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,040
So now the time in the United Kingdom is back to GMT Greenwich mean time or

124
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,800
You can also say UTC and then you have then there's also the Zulu part and that's even an hour earlier

125
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,320
But that's really confusing because that's like an aviation thing that even pilots barely barely every use

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,120
Let's see oh this is a big news out of the Netherlands. Yes, we're talking about the Netherlands being a

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Big test bed for

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,640
For basically all kinds of markets because of its extremely western culture although that's that's changing every day

129
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
The immigration

130
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Issues have kind of gotten out of hand there

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,760
But it's a very western culture very modern great infrastructure

132
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,240
They had at one point. I don't know if it's still that way they had the most densely cable

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,360
They were the most densely cableed country in the world so high proliferation of

134
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,320
Cable television also broadband is really big now and

135
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:12,120
The Dutch version of Ask Cat BMI there she is hey baby come on in. I was just talking about Buma Stemina

136
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,120
Great grab the head fuck I got headphones for you. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is real. Yeah, it's professional

137
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Hey, you're going to pay me for that

138
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Oh

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,360
You want to start running through the supermarket

140
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,440
Is it too high? No, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. It's a little

141
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,680
No, it's okay. You got a kind of close mic it. Yeah. This isn't you're not singing a record

142
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm interrupting just go ahead

143
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Okay, so what I was saying is the Dutch Buma Stemina. Yeah, I would do my statement

144
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,920
Which is the Dutch Ask Cat BMI they had kind of told podcasters that if they paid 35 euros a month

145
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,680
Then they could use whatever you know, they could play whatever music they wanted on their podcast

146
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,600
You like kind of steam song pass a podcast and listen to so she's doing it under that regulation yeah, but now the end

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,400
And I shoot my stool is not right the NIVP the Nadelons Institute for plant the home alone

148
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,200
I would ever do so that's basically the RIA of the Netherlands

149
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,240
They said hey, no way not gonna happen no one has permission to play the songs

150
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,600
You have to clear you know to basically the same thing, you know if you play if you so Buma Stemina will have to come up with a new license and

151
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,280
You'll still you still can't play the song you have to go and clear them through every every record company independently

152
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,600
So that means you guys get really powerful

153
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,320
Who oh the guys who have the podcasts and the beautiful shows and yeah, yeah, exactly

154
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,840
It counts no kidding. Yeah, yeah, no they could totally make in themselves irrelevant so incredibly stupid

155
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
Idiots

156
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,040
What you're gonna do about that nothing screw them

157
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
You know, we're putting together all right

158
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,680
No, yeah, we're just ignore ignore licensed music it will just play pod save music

159
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,120
That's yeah, we're putting together like a Christmas song. We are the world

160
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Hey, do you want to be on that?

161
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
We're doing a Christmas song

162
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,640
Sure, uh, when it it's you want to hear it? Hold on a second. Let me see

163
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,680
Everybody's gonna sing all the podcasts. No, no, please not the podcast. No, no, we actually want to put something professional together

164
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
That would sound really good

165
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Hold on, let me see

166
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
It's just a podcast Christmas hit

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,320
Exactly, but we kind of want to do like a we are the world type thing because that's what the song is kind of like

168
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,640
But then we want to get you know like brother love and chance and you know and all these people from the

169
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,240
Music network and of course there's thousand so it's someone have to make a choice

170
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240

On sick it's by I don't this guy's name is slow, which is kind of weird

175
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,960
If every day we're Christmas. I'll just play a little bit because I want to talk to you

176
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I don't want to play the music

177
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
But tell me this doesn't have like

178
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
That's Michael Jackson singing right

179
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
And then Bruce Springsteek comes in

180
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
This is the hook is pretty good

181
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,120
Exactly, you got to have your headphones on you and hold your headphones like two year

182
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Oh, let me get to the heart

183
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Takes a little while to get to that actually

184
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
And everybody

185
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Yeah, it would be

186
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,160
Oh, you can speak yes, never feel blue all our dreams will come true

187
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Every day

188
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,600
Pretty good, huh? Very nice you want to be on it needs a little bit of over push

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Well, you know a Ronald Ronald immediately wanted to get the the Dutch metropolitan in our orchestra to play

190
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm like now dude, let's just keep it simple

191
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,680
He always wants to and it's and he can get it that's the whole thing as you can definitely get it

192
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,080
No, it would be for free, but it's just I just like let's just keep it pod safe and do it with you know

193
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,760
If someone else wants to add something to it, what does it need like maybe a guitar or something

194
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,560
I need some rhythm and a little I'm pushing do you see how I'm pushing oh yeah

195
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
I see it it's a bit slow

196
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Well, we can spin it up

197
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,960
Talk in the mic baby more rhythm so I haven't told anyone yet

198
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
About our we have we're celebrating today

199
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,480
Haven't told anybody I'm bleeding today as you're still bleeding. I'm still bleeding. You might have to have stitches

200
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,800
You think no, I'm not interested in seeing it but you should cut her for her pinky on

201
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:25,000
On the on the vase yeah, there's a piece of the glass the glass falls glass vase yes the vase and you say to my toe

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,320
Yeah, and I was cleaning the table and hit hit it with my face and I sliced you sliced and I sliced

203
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,160
You know like a little part of skin and I pushed it back

204
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,520
Really fast and put something around it

205
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,280
All right, and a bandaid, but it doesn't work. It doesn't stop bleeding

206
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,280
Because of your own your medicine you're bleeding to death. I have block thinners and now what I don't know

207
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,680
It's as the stop song stick it in my butt that'll stop it. Oh, there was stop it right away

208
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
So

209
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Yesterday was yesterday

210
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,480
Yeah, yesterday we went for a test drive because you know we've been looking for a new car

211
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,800
We found out yesterday by the way from Crystal the PA

212
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,320
Crystal the PA who lives in Geneva and

213
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,640
Was she was in a Miami and couldn't get out because of Wilma

214
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,360
Yeah, she was there for two weeks and I just stay like an extra day or two because she couldn't get out of the age. You couldn't fly out

215
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,440
Yeah, so she found out that the the Audi has to be read is it you know a company lease?

216
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,560
It has to go back December 11. So I've got taxi Eric. I've scheduled him. He's gonna fly over

217
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,560
And he'll drive it back the 23rd okay, 23rd

218
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,840
So we we need a new car and we've been talking about a diesel because of you know my whole hang up on biodiesel

219
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,160
You know who else is a Woody Harrelson is really big into biodiesel. Oh, okay. He was on the

220
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,280
I think it's night show someone told me yeah, he's such a normal guy

221
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Well, he's kind of like me

222
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,920
Yeah, yeah, he is he's bit strange and and he believes in the Oliur baby

223
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,400
Yeah, he's our thinkers. Yeah, exactly

224
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,800
So we test drove a Jaguar

225
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
It's not a Jaguar

226
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,640
Jaguar what we said was you know you said what kind of car would you like and I said

227
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,920
I love Jaguar. No, no, I think you said any kind of cars long as it's a Jaguar

228
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,560
No, first I said you mean just a small one. I can do my groceries

229
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,560
You mean you didn't really know you said no you said yeah, but you didn't know you said

230
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,400
Jeep, but you said you ever know, but if I have to drive it, you know, you don't fit in it

231
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
You wanted like a little jeep

232
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:42,760
Yeah, so the pod father cannot drive in a girly jeep. I don't care where I am you didn't want that because yeah, I know it looks very silly

233
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,520
Again, okay, so nothing against gay, but no, that looks so small

234
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:59,000
Not so expensive nice Jaguars. Yeah, so we went to look for not so expensive nice Jaguars and I said in the back

235
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,040
First of all, the

236
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,280
Sales guy was nice sales guy was funny. Yeah, yeah, and I said in the back and I thought

237
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
God, it's a really cheap

238
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,560
Everything sounds cheap. It's for yeah, even the estraise. I don't know what was in there everything was like

239
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,320
Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung

240
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:23,880
You know, very plastic very Ford. I have to well, it's been that and that was quite the disappointment

241
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Yeah, that was

242
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
So then we said okay

243
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:35,080
We looked at well, no, no, we still looked at if we got the right color and we got the right engine and we got everything and if we got all the things

244
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:42,360
We wanted which would kind of be dressing up, you know, basically dressing up a piece of shit, yeah, but at least making it bearable by that time

245
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
We found out

246
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,400
It was certainly wasn't a cheap car anymore. No, it wasn't

247
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,400
No, it was reasonably expensive and actually it wasn't the right one

248
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,960
No, well, so we looked and because you I drove the car then you drove the car and like yeah drives it drove really well

249
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,960
I'll drove nice and then we both sat in the back on the way to the dealership

250
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,520
We went like this is like like a crap. Yeah

251
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,400
And I said I'm sorry, this is piece of crap. We got to try something

252
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,280
And so they and so then what and then of course you immediately in the show room

253
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,600
But just your jumps into the XK convertible puts on her shades and her scar

254
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,200
This is what I like yeah, but it has no backseat baby. Nobody can sit in the bexie. No no no grandmong grandma coming over no

255
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,560
no

256
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:36,120
That's so that's a no no and then there was these oh and there was Elton John's car. Oh, that's right

257
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,480
That was interesting the

258
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,920
Elton John basically follows this one mechanic and

259
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,880
Just like a mechanical team or something and he follows them around and they've been at the

260
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,720
H.A. Fox dealer for 10 years and so all of his cars are serviced there and what he had is my Mazurati was there

261
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,960
Yeah, so and we saw on the parking lot beautiful

262
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,000
Beautiful his cell phone was in it. I so wanted to grab it and get his number. Yeah

263
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,120
But we saw nice cars on the parking lot

264
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,920
And we said yeah, that's a good one and that's a nice one. Yeah, but they don't sell Mazurati's

265
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,840
Right so because so what happened there is then we were like then we started look because you know

266
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,680
The Audi is a really nice luxury salute car, you know, we're very spoiled. Yeah, exactly

267
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:25,320
But we don't want a tank anymore. No, so what we do we we didn't buy a tank we bought a

268
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Anair craft carry

269
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
So they had two

270
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
What do they call them?

271
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Goreches cars

272
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,240
XJ yeah, and it turns out so that was an XJ that

273
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
It's like a year old yeah, and

274
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,440
It has a 24,000 miles on one of the guys who work there. Yeah, it's one of them

275
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,760
Of course they do. Oh, this was a

276
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,480
Board of director he only sat in the back he was driven

277
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,600
So what it smelled good. I always smell the car. Yeah, I'll change that

278
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,640
So I said yet that is a nice car

279
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,280
Oh, man, that is exactly the car. So we actually got it for the same price who would have paid for the

280
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
ergonomically friendly

281
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Crap in the earth tank craft car

282
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,480
And we just couldn't resist I went back this morning. I said, let me test drive this thing

283
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,560
It's beautiful. It's gorgeous. It's a supercharged V8

284
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,400
You can just hear and we have to say we are not really in two cars

285
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,880
Not at all. I don't give a shit at all, but sitting in it this morning. I didn't

286
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,280
Man, I put the seat warmer on because you know, I always have to have the seat on high

287
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,320
And then the steering the beautiful wood steering wheel started to heat up in my hands. I was like

288
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,760
And then it talked you can press a button and you'd say like climb the controls 62 degrees

289
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,640
What we actually are are just we are nerdy car users

290
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,440
We just want to have comfy

291
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,320
You know nice comfort of it. We're definitely not greenies baby not with that car

You might have had poor vegetable oil in your tank

297
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
That's a good idea

298
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120

316
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:53,800
Okay, now I was looking here comes I heard on the on the radio that there is sort of a nasal spray

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:22,040
On the inside of your nose. Yeah, and it protects the inside of your nose and you cannot catch cold. Really?

321
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,360
So easy. Well, it was a commercial on the radio where Dr. Under on the morning show this morning on the

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
Yeah, what Terry woven show

323
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,240
No, it was on TV. Oh, and also Barrow who I just spoke to

324
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,720
Our house cleaning the house

325
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,280
She said yeah, it's it's brilliant. We have to we have to buy it. It's brilliant

326
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,680
Well, but that's I know it can't find it. No, not yet. Remember that guy. Maybe he's brand new

327
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
with a doctor

328
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,120
It was it was like we were just in New York. I think in that doctor and David Brenner was one of his patients and he would take these long

329
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,200
Cotton swabs with cocaine on the end and stick him in their nose

330
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:11,080
It was like some kind of treatment. It was everyone was laughing about it. Do you remember that and then they would they be walking around the office like five or six of these wooden sticks

331
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
No, I was David Brenner did that too

332
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:26,520
No, no, no, but I'm yeah, but I'm talking about that years and years before there was some kind of alternative treatment

333
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,240
Oh, is that? Well, of course not it's for cocaine heads

334
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Naysley and exactly

335
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Okay, okay

336
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Okay, I mentioned that

337
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Well, maybe somebody has an idea

338
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,120
Well, they're definitely respond because I talked about Skype and how I can't hook the Skype phone up to a Mac

339
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,720
Yeah, and everyone is sending me like I have at least a hundred different emails of people saying

340
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,080
We can use this cheap number to call and all these but I just want to use Skype. I like Skype. It's just it's just

341
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:05,080
We have a cheap number that that we call right, but it's not as cheap as kind of no Skype is it's freaking awesome

342
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,320
And they don't know how long I speak with my mom and with my sister

343
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,760
I used to know I used to know

344
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,560
We have a lot of topics

345
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:22,120
I'll really what kind of topics. Yeah, everything yeah, everything yeah, so that takes you know it's a long

346
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,800
When did you just want you I could get your wireless headset?

347
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,800
Would you like that is that cheap? Well, no, the thing is like I'm gonna get you a Mac for the kitchen

348
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,240
But I can't get you the Skype handset to connect to the Mac that they don't make it for the Mac. Oh

349
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,120
Okay, that's the problem so I could get you a wireless headset or at least a headset maybe you like walking around with the phone or not

350
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,360
If it's possible, yeah, but I always have an idea. I have to stay you know near near you

351
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,440
It works better if you say this

352
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Skype is gonna disconnect me

353
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah, and it's gone. Yeah, it's like they throw you off

354
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,240
Well, if I give you a headset, then you if you just stay attached to the computer then it'll always work

355
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,480
But you have to kind of stay by the computer. Yeah, but it's not possible when Christina's it

356
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,760
But let's do that when I have my own station in the kitchen your own station Patricia's gonna get a station

357
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,080
The first time

358
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,760
Would you have a leaking you believe no?

359
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,520
When when when when you first came to live with me don't you remember what I said about computers

360
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,680
And the beta will for strad?

361
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,880
While you said keep keep them away from me, but just

362
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,040
Because I'm gonna be addicted to it. It was my Commodore 64. Yeah, and I had it hidden away in a closet and I said what is this?

363
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
He said keep it away from me

364
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
We fucked that up

365
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,120
Was once you start? He says no going back. There's no going back. No

366
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,840
Okay, what do you want to do you want to hang around or do you want to do a backtrack squeeze with what do we and what do you want to do?

You're bleeding, so maybe that has something to do with it. It is really hard. I just I cannot

401
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,000
Register, I don't know it's very hard. You do recognize something. Yeah

402
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,720
But it's hard. Yeah, well the second time around it gets much easier. Yeah, yeah, so when he does the answer

403
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,080
That's actually when I the first one I didn't hear today at all. I had no idea that it was anything

404
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
You are very good at titles

405
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,480
Not wasn't good today. It was good at the lyrics, but not at the titles to you want to know a disc

406
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,360
Disco yeah, so I have all the Lawrence Welk album. This is so I'm a disc drug

407
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,120
You're gonna go make some tea and then uh, okay, and then uh, you have to do an eye dog commercial for me

408
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,000
Thanks, baby. Now, all right, see you in a bit

409
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Got in a lot of feedback about

410
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,720
Subscribing and unsubscribing and iTunes and luckily

411
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,320
Some audio feedback about the topic. Hey Adam. This is Scott TD in Saskatoon Saskatchewan

412
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,200
And I've just listening to your last podcast on Delz is Cherich early

413
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,480
273 and someone was complaining about they had deleted a file for my tunes and didn't know how to get back

414
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,440
Well, if you just go down and hit unsubscribe

415
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,960
Then hit subscribe, which will pop up right next to the eye to the feed you've just unsubscribed from

416
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,480
It'll go out and check the RSS feed and get any ones that are currently on it

417
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,840
I've done this a couple times before and it's worked out great

418
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,600
I've actually been able to go back about 20 or 30 episodes depending on the podcast

419
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
So that should hopefully work for that guy and

420
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Keep on doing what you're doing

421
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,760
All right, dude. Thanks. Much appreciated. A lot of people sent that in

422
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
But it's still not a

423
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,400
I still think it's kind of a bug in the way it works. Hold on one second. Let me just have a sip here

424
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,400
Oh, that was fun having the princess here on our Friday extravaganza

425
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,440
So we went through let's see we went through the Dutch stuff

426
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,280
Hi, this was interesting my space.com has created their own record label. That's pretty cool

427
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,000
Although they're kind of doing a packaging thing

428
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,880
Which by the way is commercially. I think very smart

429
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,840
They're putting together see it's the the imprint

430
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,000
Is what's going to be called I think to be manufactured by universal music groups interscope records

431
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,160
I've seen it number 15. So it's just when it drops

432
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,840
It'll be the compilation called my space records volume one and

433
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,960
It'll have mix of tracks by major label independent label and unsigned acts

434
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,840
So sounds like a third will be really

435
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,160
non

436
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,120
non-label pod safe we's there's going to be all there

437
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,440
It's going to be on there all American rejects fall out boy

438
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Okay, so I think that's very cool

439
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,680
That's not exactly what we're planning with the unlabel concept

440
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,400
But it definitely is a start get more more music out there

441
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,200
And I presume that that those independent songs will be pod safe that'll actually be interesting to see

442
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,120
When those come out if they're licensed by as cab BMI and they haven't been entered into the

443
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Excuse me

444
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,840
No, I'm not going to say it they haven't been entered entered into the pod set music network

445
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,360
Then we won't even be able to to play them so be cool if they could actually mention if they're pod safe or not

446
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,200
Okay, uh, man Patricia's gonna be back with a T in a second and she's gonna

447
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,640
To some advertising so let's do some promos in the meantime. This is the sound of 25 cents

448

On every college campus in America. This sound can be heard every second of every day

449
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,600

The amount of money each year that families need in financial aid that they don't get

451

Just boom, yeah, yere, switch Call me if I want to

Shout them, shout them, shout them, I end them up high

552
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:33,480
I hope that's Pod Safe, I'm just gonna suppose it is.

553
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,480
I have no idea who DJ Kingfish is, but totally, totally rocked like that.

554
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,480
A bit you drew from Dawn and Drew is rocking away to that too.

555
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,480
He's a big reggae head and major.

556
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,480
All right, but I don't want to make the show too long, so hopefully, hopefully,

557
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
there's my Dutch slipping in again.

558
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Hopefully, but you should be back with the tea just in time for the end of the show.

559
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Let me see.

560
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,480
I'll go call her and you listen to...

561
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Once again, for me to swallow my pride.

562
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Because it is that time in the month again.

563
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,480
That time of the month where I asked for you to go over to Podcast Halley and vote for Podcast 4-1-1.

564
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Is that time of the month where I asked for you to go over to Podcast Pickle and pick me as one of your favorites.

565
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Show number 97 on the pickle.

566
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Time to go over to Odio and subscribe to Podcast 4-1-1.

567
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
And let's not forget iTunes.

568
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Subscribe for Podcast 4-1-1 there.

569
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,480
And then there's Podcast.yahoo.com.

570
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Is that so much to ask?

571
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Well, actually, yes.

572
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,480
That's not too many places.

573
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
I had this, she is.

574
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Thank you, dear.

575
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Tea.

576
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Tea.

577
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Magic.

578
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Remember, Magic was pissed off that there were no queer potters featured in iTunes.

579
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Remember, I told you that?

580
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I told you that, right?

581
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
I'm sorry.

582
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
I don't have your mic on.

583
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Oops.

584
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
There we go.

585
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
And also that there's been no queer podcast.

586
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Don't let Steve hear it.

587
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Then he won't put me on the home page.

588
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:28,480
There's also been no queer castor apparently on the podcast 4-1, which is kind of like an industry magazine type show.

589
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Are you still bleeding?

590
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Yes.

591
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
What are we going to do?

592
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
I don't know.

593
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Look at that later.

594
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
You're so hardcore, baby.

595
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Thank you for the tea.

596
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Okay.

597
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
So, for you, I was just thinking for your Skype.

598
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,480
We have a Logitech, one of our sponsors.

599
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Makes a Bluetooth wireless headset.

600
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Oh.

601
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
Yeah.

602
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,480
So, I just had to figure out what to do with the microphone, but at least the headphone part can be.

603
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
But you want mine wearing headphones?

604
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Is that okay?

605
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
It does mess up the hair.

606
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
No.

607
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
No.

608
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,480
You can wear them like Abba underneath your chin.

609
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
How lame was that?

610
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
No one did that?

611
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
No one did that.

612
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
It's very uncrew.

613
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
I don't want to mess up my hair.

614
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,480
So, I'll, I remember I used to go to radio stations when he had it.

615
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,480
He's singing back to back.

616
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Knowing me.

617
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
Knowing you.

618
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,480
There is nothing we can do.

619
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
It's a good radio station.

620
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
When I had the big hair.

621
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,480
And they'd be amazed when I put the headphones on over the big hair.

623
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Wow.

624
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
We thought you wouldn't want to mess up your hair.

625
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Well, and if anybody doesn't care about his hair.

626
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
That would be me.

627
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
That's you.

628
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Except when I didn't have it.

629
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
Yeah.

630
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
But when with all of that.

631
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Yeah.

632
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
When Sam.

633
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Shh.

634
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Just add them.

635
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Just add them.

636
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
That's right.

637
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
Just add.

638
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Just add.

639
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Well, it's made me the man that I am, baby.

640
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,480
It's true.

641
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Yeah.

642
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
That's true.

643
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Remember?

644
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
You said, you said, can I change your hair?

645
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
So, as long as you take care of, you do it.

646
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
You've been doing my hair for 19 years now.

647
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Yeah.

648
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Well, it's not so important anymore.

649
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,480
But then, I mean, you just looked like anybody else.

650
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Right.

651
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
You didn't have the expected.

652
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
The expected.

653
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
I didn't have the expected.

654
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
You added hair factor to me.

655
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Yeah.

656
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
You know, Chris Rockwell, daily download, poopcaster.

657
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Yeah.

658
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,480
So he actually shaved his ass hair.

659
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
But he shaved it.

660
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Yeah.

661
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
It's almost stupid experiments.

662
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
But he shaved it.

663
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,480
And then like a day later, it really started to, to shave and get red and scratchy.

664
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Or then he didn't do it right, didn't he?

665
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,480
Well, so, but I was thinking, I mean, does anyone still actually shave?

666
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
I mean, there's not what would nare and veet are for.

667
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Isn't that much easier?

668
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
No.

669
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,480
But I don't know if you did it with a lady shave or, but if you put baby powder on the first.

670
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
Baby powder.

671
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,480
And then with a lady shave, or have a very nice soft shaving cream.

672
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Mm-hmm.

673
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
And powder it after.

674
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,480
He probably didn't even know how to do it.

675
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
We ladies do it for years.

676
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Would you do it for years?

677
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
Would you do it for years?

678
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
You didn't even know we had it.

679
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
That's right.

680
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,480
I didn't even grew there until I got married.

681
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
No.

682
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
No.

683
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
That's not.

684
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
That's not.

685
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
That's not.

686
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm kidding.

687
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
I'm kidding.

688
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
I'm kidding.

689
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Yeah.

690
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Right.

691
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Okay.

692
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,480
So I brought home the eye dog.

693
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Yeah.

694
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
It's cute.

695
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Yeah.

696
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
You have not been paid to say this.

697
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
No.

698
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,480
No.

699
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
No.

700
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
It's a commercial.

701
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
So tell me about the eye dog.

702
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Only moves and it reacts on people's voices and sounds.

703
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
And what else does it actually do?

704
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
It doesn't.

705
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
Well, you know, it's something.

706
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
It's nice to put it down.

707
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,480
You don't feel lonely when you have a little dog.

708
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
What have you been doing with the eye dog, huh?

709
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
When I'm not there, I know what else.

710
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
It moves it's ears.

711
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
It wiggles it.

712
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Wiggles it's down.

713
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Mm-hmm.

714
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Uh-huh.

715
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Uh-huh.

716
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Yeah.

717
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
No, you don't like that.

718
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
What?

719
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
No.

720
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
No.

721
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Oh.

722
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
Um.

723
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,480
Sex toys.

724
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Yeah.

725
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
Yeah.

726
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
I hate that sound.

727
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
That turns me off.

728
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
No.

729
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
No.

730
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
No.

731
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
No.

732
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Doesn't it sound?

733
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,480
You know?

734
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
I don't know if you haven't been listening.

735
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Maybe you should put your ear closer to it.

736
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
I don't.

737
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
No.

738
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Maybe you're like the sound.

739
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
No, that is kind of a turn off.

740
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,480
It's such a turn.

741
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
Mm-hmm.

742
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
So back to the other.

743
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
Desperate.

744
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Sounds so desperate.

745
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,480
It is kind of a...

746
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,480
I've never been desperate.

747
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
It's always been there.

748
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
Mm-hmm.

749
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
Mm-hmm.

750
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
So anyway, it's like a $30.

751
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
I don't miss a pretty cool gift.

752
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,480
Yeah.

753
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,480
The eye dog.

754
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
Should we give an eye dog to someone for Christmas?

755
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,480
Who would also like that?

756
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Roxy would probably like that?

757
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Yeah, I think so.

758
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
She would love that.

759
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,480
I bet she would like that.

760
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,480
Yeah.

761
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,480
Okay.

762
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,480
It's a great stocking stuffer.

763
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,480
But it's sweet.

764
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
It looks sweet.

765
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Yeah.

766
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Yeah, it does.

767
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,480
Some guys want to hack it.

768
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
They want to see if they can program it.

769
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,480
Which I think is totally cool.

770
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
Yeah, I bet they can hack it.

771
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
I bet it's hackable.

772
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
Like what?

773
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,480
Like what?

774
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
I don't know.

775
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Who knows?

776
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,480
I mean, it does learn.

777
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
It does have some like nano pet type stuff in there.

778
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
So it does do more things.

779
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,480
And it learns from when you interact with it.

780
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,480
When you rub it's head or have it's tail wiggle somewhere.

781
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Yeah.

782
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
And it learns.

783
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
Ah.

784
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
Ah.

785
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
Okay.

786
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Um.

787
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
It's our Friday show on.

788
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,480
So we always have to do something special.

789
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
Friday.

790
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,480
We want to sing along.

791
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
I mean, the New York state of life.

792
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Alright, where's your life on?

793
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,480
Everything is so fucked up.

794
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Oh yeah.

795
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
Everything is so fucked up.

796
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
Hey, baby, what's up?

797
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,480
I can't play jazz in a singer.

798
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
Hold on a second.

799
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Hold on.

800
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
Christina?

801
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Yeah.

802
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,480
What, can you hear me?

803
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
Yeah.

804
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
Wait a minute.

805
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,480
What is it on?

806
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
Go ahead, say it.

807
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,480
I said the time is not here yet.

808
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Oh, man, do those guys suck or what?

809
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,480
What time is quarter to four?

810
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
Can they just get it right?

811
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Well, come on.

812
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
You call him Christina?

813
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
Yeah, call him.

814
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
I don't know.

815
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
Yeah.

816
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
Yeah, you call him.

817
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Just call him and say, would you want to say?

818
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
Okay.

819
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Okay.

820
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
We pay for it.

821
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,480
And they need to be on time.

822
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Do you hear that?

823
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
Christina.

824
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
I can hear you.

825
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,480
Mom says, will you please call them and say,

826
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Hey, yo, I'm waiting for my cab.

827
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,480
Okay.

828
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,480
It's Aaron Call.

829
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
No, I'm sorry, baby.

830
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
Okay.

831
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,480
Call the cab and call me back and let me know what they said.

832
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,480
All right.

833
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,480
Love you.

834
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
Bye.

835
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,480
Bye.

836
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,480
She wants it.

837
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
We had tickets for the day.

838
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,480
We had tickets for my chemical romance last night.

839
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,480
We didn't hear until like 7 p.m.

840
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,480
Way too late to go to Brickson Academy.

841
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,480
And then we couldn't get him for tonight.

842
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,480
So she's she's like the Aaron Call.

843
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
Aaron's very disappointed.

844
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
Yeah.

845
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,480
But you know, I'm not going to go to Brickson Academy.

846
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,480
When we're just eating at 7 p.m.

847
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,480
You know, it's an hour and a half.

848
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
What?

849
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,480
Old fashioned.

850
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,480
What's that?

851
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
Is that your phone now?

852
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,480
No.

853
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
Man, what's going on here?

854
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,480
Okay.

855
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,480
Well, let's see if that.

856
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,480
Okay.

857
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
I hate music.

858
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
That's Hall Westerberg.

859
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,480
You think it's fun to be 31 and have ambition.

860
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Not the bullets for the gun.

861
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,480
Everything is so fucked up.

862
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,480
Everything is so fucked up.

863
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,480
Everything is so fucked up.

864
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,480
My fingers just ran.

865
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
Hello.

866
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,480
There you go.

867
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
I love it.

868
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
I love it.

869
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,480
I love it.

870
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
That is so fucked up.

871
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,480
Exactly.

872
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,480
So I got an email.

873
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,480
William Durfei,

874
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
which is,

875
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,480
Hold on.

876
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,480
What's his email address here?

877
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
It's,

878
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,480
W.

879
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
Okay. He's at apple.com.

880
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
I'm not going to give his email address out.

881
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
Hi Adam.

882
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,480
We received several complaints about offensive content

883
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,480
in your daily source code podcast.

884
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,480
You.

885
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,480
Yeah.

886
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,480
Well, how about that?

887
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,480
Everything's so fucked up.

888
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
That would be,

889
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Please mark your podcast.

890
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480
Explicit.

891
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,480
I have attached to a spec document that will explain how to do that.

892
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,480
You will not have to resummit your podcast.

893
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,480
It will be automatically updated about 24 hours after you make the change.

894
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
How that said.

895
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,480
There's such a need person.

896
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,480
So much.

897
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,480
Well, and you have magic.

898
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,480
When you have magic,

899
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,480
yelling at Steve Jobs to stop pulling his pants up to his vagina.

900
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,480
I think, you know,

901
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
that some people just take offense to that.

902
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Wow.

903
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
These are the right words.

904
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Yeah, I know.

905
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
I know.

906
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,480
But it's not done.

907
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
But it's just, just put the text.

908
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,480
It'll say explicit.

909
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,480
Nothing else happens.

910
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,480
It's just, it's a warning.

911
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,480
It's a warning so that people know that bad language could occur.

912
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,480
It doesn't feel, you know, I have a vagina.

913
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,480
I don't feel offensive for any.

914
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,480
Can I tell you something?

915
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,480
Yeah.

916
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
You have a wonderful vagina.

917
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Thank you very much.

918
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
God.

919
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,480
Yeah.

920
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,480
But I, you know, I don't feel.

921
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,480
You don't feel insulted.

922
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
Exactly.

923
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,480
No, okay.

924
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,480
Well, you also didn't report to iTunes.

925
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,480
So.

926
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,480
Okay.

927
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,480
Alrighty.

928
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
Okay.

929
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
I think you want to say to anybody.

930
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,480
Uh, no.

931
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,480
Thank you for listening.

932
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
Yes.

933
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
Shout out.

934
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,480
And, uh, you love me.

935
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,480
You really love me.

936
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,480
It's true.

937
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,480
Oh, you spilled on my carpet.

938
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,480
No.

939
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
I think a little bit.

940
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,480
Yeah.

941
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,480
You mean, blood?

942
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,480
Yes, be careful.

943
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
All right, everybody.

944
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,480
Have a great weekend.

945
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,480
I'll be back here on Monday.

946
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,480
Take care of yourself.

947
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,480
Another pod show podcast.

948
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,480
Stick it in your ear.
