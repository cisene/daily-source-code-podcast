00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta Sierra Charley 2-6-0

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You're dating?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Friday Friday!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One, two, three!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning!

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Good morning!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good morning!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Good morning!

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There are no secrets!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Only information you don't get out of here!

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Adam Curry!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey everybody!

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's Thursday, October 14, 2005.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And hello!

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm doing it for Mother!

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I come to you from Curry Cottage, direct from the UK from the affluent suburb of Gilford and Surrey.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It is the daily source code.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Everything seems a little bit soft today.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So just a minute, let me see.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll forget my own soft.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm just looking at the audio.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's try it this way.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Awesome!

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Come back!

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And it's busy!

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My sisters here, although I have to admit, I don't think I'm going to go around the show today.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
She just left with...

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, I know what the problem is.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is interesting.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let me add some volume in.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Watch your ears, okay?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There we go.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's better.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A little adjustment on the mega set.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's so hard rebuilding three computers at once.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's biggest challenge at my professional career.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It is indeed Friday.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And what a couple of days I had.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hopefully you heard yesterday's source code recorded in the middle of the night.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wednesday night in Amsterdam.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Everything went very well, though the business crap that I was dealing with.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you for acquiring.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In fact, it went exceptionally well.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Exactly the way I planned it, although it took much longer than expected.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, yes, there's flight back.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I actually had an easy jet book and had a couple of different options.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It lasted so long that I had to call the Wing Commander.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Which meant I had the most awesome flight back in the most implement weather you can imagine.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I am actually...

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am sea conditions, tens and London radar guiding me the entire way.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I felt like...

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I felt like Jodie on almost.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was flying with the big boys, you know, separated by only a couple thousand feet from...

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
from 747s and stuff like that.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Love that fly.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All right.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
To kick it off.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're Friday.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You want to crank this one up.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's Bono versus Bono.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I hope you know who Bono is.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You two and let's Zep.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
On the source code.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You need...

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Ooh!

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Baby, I love you.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Not too stressed.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Back to school now.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wait there, instead.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll hold it in your meals.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't want to give you my love.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't want to give you my love.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
One whole hour ago.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
One whole hour ago.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
One whole hour ago.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Two whole hour ago.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In the high and winter crossing and rain

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
See each other natives and the souls on to your bed

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
From the fire down the land, the rain on the sky

84
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,000
See a face of fear rushing down the land

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
From the fire down the land

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
From the fire down the land

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
From the fire down the land

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,400
Bono versus Bono. Let's up on YouTube. I don't know. It's down a little. I guess let's

93
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,400
up on always sound a little messy almost, but yet it isn't. It's a good one, good

94
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,240
mash up digging it. I might even have time for another mash up today if we if we

95
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,760
really want to get the weekend into full swing. It's crappy weather today. It was, well,

96
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,440
as I said yesterday, it was just horrible. We had about 800 feet cloud ceiling at

97
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,760
Fair Oaks, which is my local airport. I just got to tell you, this was the first full

98
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,480
trip where really from the moment we took off to the literally the moment we landed. I

99
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,800
was under radar control and flying on instruments. And now I'm really starting to

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,760
understand the the difficulty of instrument flying. You have to imagine or you

101
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,280
have to know that when you fly into clouds or inclement weather and you can't see

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,200
anything it's just basically white or gray and it's all it's surrounded you. You'll

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,560
probably think within a few seconds, I feel like the plane is drifting towards the

104
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,000
left. You know, I've got a compensate. We're actually maybe rolling over right and

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,680
banking it already 30 degrees and you won't even know it. This is of course what

106
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,200
happened to Kennedy Jr. Because he didn't have enough experience. I guess it's a

107
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,840
vertigo thing. And you get into clouds and if you don't have any experience with

108
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,760
this, if you haven't practiced this over and over again within 35 seconds, I guarantee

109
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,840
you'll be wondering what that boat is doing in the clouds because you'll be upside down

110
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,400
flying straight into the drink. Of course, I was crossing the English channel, but it was

111
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,120
a lot of fun. And I got the hang of it. I can do it. But it's very, very, very intense.

112
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,720
But it's cool, you know, and you're being led and they tell you, okay, turn left

113
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,680
240 and you know, so you turn left and keep your altitude if you may taint the

114
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,240
altitude at all times, of course. And then, you know, they'll send you down and then

115
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,880
you break through the clouds and there it is. There's the airport right in front of you.

116
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,680
It's just the, ah, it's a great, a great ride. Definitely an A ticket.

117
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:16,120
Ah, okay. So several things to talk about today. I want to continue the discussion

118
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,040
about the new video iPod. A lot of excitement about that, particularly from people

119
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,160
who are already doing video blogging, man, that I receive a whole bunch of emails.

120
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,160
So I'm also seeing more people now doing video versions of their podcast. So they'll,

121
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,920
they'll do the regular podcasts, but they'll have a camera on them. And it's, it's, it

122
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,240
is kind of interesting. I haven't actually seen a very long one other than the Mary

123
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,920
and Carla, is it Mary and Carla show? Actually, I'm going to play one for you later on.

124
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,280
And there's something very exciting coming out of the brain of Mad Dwindstein. And you

125
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,360
know there's a lot of crap going on in there. So we'll get to that just a quick, remember

126
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,000
I was talking about that Danny came movie earlier this week. And I couldn't come up with

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the title of it. Thank you all very much. Of course, I could have gone to IMDB and, and figured

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,480
it out, but forgot to do that. Song is born as the title of the movie where, where music

129
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,480
is changing right all around these professors, including Danny Kay while they're writing

130
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,000
the big book of music. And then they emerge and it turns out that jazz has already been

131
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,400
born. And, and of course, they, they freak out completely. They've been writing the book that

132
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,080
is outdated. It's a great movie. I wonder if you can still get it on. I wonder if it's been

133
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,800
published on DVD or if there's a way to get it. So looking forward to a short weekend, Saturday

134
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,080
of course, my sister is here with her girlfriend. And so they all went off shopping and

135
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,360
go for thank goodness. But I'll see if I can get the tip on for a short

136
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,840
day. You got to talk. You've got to listen to my sister. She really is hilarious. It's

137
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,960
very, very funny. So I'll maybe we'll do that Saturday. Sunday morning early, though, I leave

138
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,280
for San Francisco for a pop at least 10 or 12 days. We got a lot of stuff to do. And I'm

139
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,000
excited about seeing the team again, although it seems like the stay at home has been way too

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,440
short. Ah, yes, the things we do for love. Hey Adam, this is Andrew Darlow. I'm a photographer

141
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,800
and editor director of magazine published out of Long Island, New York. I've been totally

142
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:25,160
hooked on podcasting for quite a while. Thanks in great part to you. Thank you. And I've listened

143
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,040
to just about every Delhi source code since May. And I also listened regularly to about

144
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:39,160
60 other great podcasts. I also keep writing about podcasting and how benefits,

145
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,360
graphic arts, professionals in my editor's letters. Since there are so many great podcasts

146
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,320
about Photoshop and imaging related things and technology. And I also hope to have my own podcast

147
00:11:51,320 --> 00:12:00,360
sometimes soon. Your recent bedcast with your lovely wife Patricia was was really great and I'd love

148
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,120
to hear more of those. Also the two songs that you played with Patricia singing when you were in

149
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,720
San Francisco. I thought we're fantastic. So feel free to bring more of those to us.

150
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,560
I'm also leaving this message because I just listened to one of the podcasts that I

151
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:24,520
subscribed to called Killer Innovations by Film McKinney. Film was recently in New Orleans for a week

152
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:30,760
helping out in the really effort in a number of ways. And his words are what really makes

153
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:38,280
podcasts in such a powerful medium. He speaks at length about the situation there as of about

154
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:45,720
10 days ago. Straight from the heart and directly from his personal experience. And in a way it was

155
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,520
sort of like when you were in San Francisco doing your sound seeing tour at two or three AM you just

156
00:12:50,520 --> 00:13:00,360
got a really good sense of what life is really like and what people are faced with. Straight up

157
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:08,200
without the dramatic music and without the 30 seconds sound bites. The podcast can be found at

158
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:16,120
KillerInnovations.com and the show is from October 3rd. The show is also available in iTunes.

159
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,440
I highly recommend listening and as Phil says if people do have the means to continue supporting

160
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,400
their really effort they do really need it. Keep up the great work and I hope that we're able to meet

161
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,080
at the big podcast Expo in California next month if you're planning to attend. Bye bye.

162
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,760
Pod Show content that will make you squeeze the dog and burp your mother.

163
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,360
This week on the travel comments podcast we talk about air world our own little ecosystem. All

164
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,160
the food stalls were connected. Same kitchen, same employees, same company. I don't think that's

165
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,880
sort of you know that's sort of concentration is is doing great things for my taste buds.

166
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,680
Breaking through a business travel gets you past the veneer of your travel destination.

167
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,920
Now tell you warn is not a place most people go when they visit Detroit you know heck it's not

168
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,800
even a place a lot of people go when they live in Detroit. However driving down Van Dyke Avenue

169
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,320
between the Chrysler plant up in Sterling Heights and the GM tech center you're sort of

170
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,480
weight in the middle of the Detroit auto culture and what Daddy does on travel. You record podcast

171
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,160
you go to meetings and you eat and you drive nice cars if you get your hands on them. All this

172
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,360
and listen your comments on the travel comments podcast. My name is Mark Peacock and I hope you'll

173
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:47,800
join me. www.travelcomers.travlco.com. Trying to think it's effort. The guy who also podcast from

174
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,320
different bathrooms while traveling it's that's not Chris Rockwell but I think there's somewhere

175
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:01,640
there's a podcast that does that that is travel related. Podcast Expo let's talk about that for a

176
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,440
second. It's coming up November I think until November 11th and 12th and this isn't too far

177
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,440
from Los Angeles is what I understand. Now first of all I've worked out the schedule I'm definitely

178
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:17,400
going to be there and just looks like the entire podcast universe is going to descend upon

179
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,760
the portable media expo and I think I think we have a really good time actually. I think it's

180
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:29,800
going to be where no index was you know maybe the woodstock of podcasting where see what we do

181
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,760
did Delta Sierra Charlie 200 from there was 200 yeah 200 and that was a great gathering with

182
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,880
the Microsoft announcing their support for RSS and just you know all kinds of good stuff going on.

183
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,840
This may be kind of like a Monterey festival. I'm not sure there may not even be an analogy but it's

184
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:54,600
going to be cool and a lot of the Pod Show programs are going to be there podcasts, podcasters

185
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,040
I think a lot of it's actually a Pod Show family members who work in the office or are going to

186
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,760
make the trek. I think Dawn and Drew are going to have their own sweet. I'm thinking like you know

187
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:15,560
maybe I should make a big entrance. Maybe maybe I should maybe there's a source code listener

188
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,920
in the neighborhood who's got a helicopter and then we loaded up with some beaches.

189
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,760
Yeah let's let's do a pimped out chopper ride and arrive at the expo.

190
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,720
Okay maybe not but that again we're going to get a huge penis limo with magic and Dawn and Drew

191
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,720
of be kind of cool if we had all of us degenerates in one limo that would be fun. Anyway I think

192
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,640
it's going to be a good time. I don't even know that much about the expo itself. I'm sure there's

193
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,800
all kinds of people displaying wares and I guess there's going to be plenty of hardware vendors and

194
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,840
software vendors but I'm really looking forward to meeting all of the podcasters. That was the

195
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,920
same thing at Nomdex because you meet someone you hear the name and like yeah I know you you know

196
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,320
it's almost like when you read someone's weblog and you know them so intimately but with podcasting

197
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,160
it's even something different because you you you can recognize the voice and and it's fun.

198
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,240
So I say that somewhere around the first or second week of November we'll see height and

199
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:24,200
activity in the podshvier. Podsaic music network did my regular check this morning. Actually

200
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,360
it across check as I received an email about a band they said they were listed on the podsaic

201
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,720
music network. Check it out indeed they were but I actually sampled the music first

202
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,680
from their website and then from PMN as we call it. It's three girls who really I should say

203
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:47,480
not girls. I just say women. Now I should say it's planet on women. Check this out.

204
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,080
Oh this makes me feel good. Nothing like streaming guitars. We're looking at women.

205
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,600
Waking up the neighborhood. Planet of women.

206
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,280
And you said that I know for. Planet of drinking. Leave me to your door.

207
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,480
But we haven't even left before. Power's drink has got it to my head.

208
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,320
It needs a one-one. Take care. Take care.

209
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,280
Can't smell it or catch on. I'm on the wall of my head.

210
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,360
I want to make a shout at all. You got me feeling good.

211
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,920
Waking up the neighborhood. Planet of women.

212
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:52,600
And you said that I know for. You got me feeling good. Stay in my way.

213
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,160
Waking up the neighborhood.

214
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:08,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,560
With a yêurate sheet?

216
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,760
Rotten- let this end. Leave my heart again. I'm just real component.

217
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,740
🤶🌶 💜🌶🈜

218
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,400
When you touch me, catch it all this time.

219
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,840
Keep blooming when you hate your death in mind.

220
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,680
I tell you I I will never feel good.

221
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,880
Won't you kiss me a little passion?

222
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,880
I don't know what I'm making

223
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,680
I don't know why I'm making

224
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Cause I don't know how I'm gonna feel in good

225
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Why you get out of the neighborhood

226
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Why not get out of the neighborhood

227
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Why you get out of the neighborhood

228
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,680
You've got me feeling good

229
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Stay in our place

230
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Why you get out of the neighborhood

231
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Why not get out of the neighborhood

232
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,680
I don't know why I'm gonna feel in good

233
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Why you get out of the neighborhood

234
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
You've got me feeling good

235
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Stay in our place

236
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I don't know why I'm gonna feel in good

237
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Stay in our place

238
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Why not get out of the neighborhood

239
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Why not get out of the neighborhood

240
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Why not get out of the neighborhood

241
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Why not get out of the neighborhood

242
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,680
I don't know why I'm gonna feel in good

243
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Stay in our place

244
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Why you get out of the neighborhood

245
00:20:51,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

246
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,920
Ah Ha Ha Ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.

247
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:34,960
I was sorry about that, that was me enjoying the tunes, waking up the neighborhood from

248
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
the Podsake Music Network.

249
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,600
You'll find a link from the show notes on dailysourcecode.com, I got to talk to Michael

250
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Demett.

251
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,040
He's the guy who's maintaining the wiki show notes, oh man, it's just been crazy.

252
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Time's on.

253
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
That just sucks.

254
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
I hate it.

255
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,520
I don't mind if someone's a thousand miles away and he's so used to someone being

256
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,680
six, seven, eight thousand miles away and in your ears when you're talking to him on Skype

257
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,480
but then you have to take all that time zone into account, which we could change that.

258
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
That sucks.

259
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
I'll just wake up at the same time.

260
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,080
I'll go to bed at the same time.

261
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,240
More about the video iPod, I've received a couple of interesting comments that, of course,

262
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,160
it plays video, we've all seen that, but they've also changed the internal specs for the sound

263
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
recording.

264
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,160
It'll now do what we'd call in podcasting a high quality recording and 44.1 kilohertz sample

265
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,640
rate.

266
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Is that the sample rate?

267
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,200
Now, the 44.1 kilohertz encoding rate, bit rate, if something like that.

268
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,480
Anyway, it's good enough.

269
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,360
It'll be great for sound seeing.

270
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,400
I think they're coming up with what I haven't seen yet is what kind of microphone attachments

271
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
there will be.

272
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,120
It'd be awesome if you could plug in just any, any old microphone or, you know, we'll see

273
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,680
if you need a mic preamp, but the iPod economy will present whatever it can once the

274
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,080
specs kind of get out and people start developing stuff.

275
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,720
That's good news.

276
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,840
And I've been thinking about, you know, what kind of content works for a video iPod?

277
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,440
And it's not like all of a sudden, I've been thinking this because I know lots of people

278
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,880
have an RCO or other type of portable video device best, Sony PSP, of course.

279
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,640
And by the way, iTunes 6 apparently plays the Sony format, so that's kind of interesting

280
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,000
there.

281
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
To it, yeah.

282
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think that, you know, first of all, I'm a strong believer that, then when it comes

283
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,600
to video, personal porn casting is going to be a big deal, but I also thought about,

284
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,360
and here's a million dollar idea for you because, of course, an idea is worth a million,

285
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,520
but a brand is worth a billion.

286
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,680
The million dollar idea is dating service.

287
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Think about that.

288
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,320
You subscribe to a site and you say, okay, here's the profile of the person I'm looking

289
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
for.

290
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,880
And then whenever there's a profile that matches, you'll get the little video on your

291
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
iPod.

292
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,120
That, I think, would be pretty cool.

293
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,640
Because it's much more personal that way.

294
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,720
If you have to look at something on your computer, this way, and that does work for me.

295
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,360
If you have some time and I think it all has to be relatively short.

296
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,320
So far, I'm seeing pretty much just short video things come across the wire, but I doubt

297
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,360
there's going to be a lot of interest for, well, you have to think about the size of the

298
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,520
screen, you know.

299
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
We talked about that the other day.

300
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,480
When you have a music video, when you see, if it's like a boy band and you have a total

301
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,160
shot of the boy band, you're not going to get any kind of detail.

302
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,480
So that's kind of a waste.

303
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,080
So we'll have to start thinking differently about, particularly if you have television

304
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,360
background, you want to get into distributing these files through iTunes, iPod and R.C.

305
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
and all other means.

306
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,160
And of course, the infrastructure is there, which is great, you know, I think I've

307
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,440
said before, Madge Weinstein has been putting videos in her podcast feed for quite a while

308
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
now.

309
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,240
It's some of it's funny, some of it's rather disturbing, but it's always worth watching

310
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,920
because it's short.

311
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,720
So I'm just waiting to see what kind of creativity pops up.

312
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,680
And then, of course, it's going to be interesting to see if there's a high demand for it.

313
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,880
I don't know how board people are with television.

314
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,040
I know that they're board with television, but how many people know they're board

315
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
with television.

316
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,360
Is it time again to point to the XNTV experiment?

317
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
I think it is.

318
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
And let me do that.

319
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,600
I'll make sure that that shows up in the wiki show notes for today's source code.

320
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,760
The XNTV experiment, please take this experiment, do it.

321
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,920
It'll cost you maybe, well, you can read through it and get the gist, but it really works

322
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
if you do it.

323
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,920
How, no matter how mundane some of the test seems, do it, you know, it'll really enlighten

324
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,280
you about what's happening when you're watching television.

325
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,360
It really will, it actually almost got me to stop watching television.

326
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:41,560
So then, depending on how many people we can save, that will determine the market for

327
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,360
video podcasting.

328
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,240
So Mad sent me a little note that I wanted to share with you because, well, once again,

329
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,520
she's on the cusp of technology and is starting a really something interesting.

330
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,680
Of course, we already have Q-Podder.org, which now has over 100 queer podcasters, queer

331
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,160
casters, Q-Podders, whatever you want to call it.

332
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,680
And now there's some packaging going on in Q-Podder.org world.

333
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Hello, Adam.

334
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,320
As Mad's wine steam from East Radio, I have some wonderful news for you.

335
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,440
Related to this business about video podcasting, as you know, and mentioned, I've been

336
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,280
doing this sort of thing for very long time, longer than I've been podcasting, in fact.

337
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,840
And I do have a website that's been around for five years, called InsaneFilms.com.

338
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,520
But that's not what I'm calling you about or leaving you this for cock to message.

339
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,480
I'm leaving this because I have wonderful news.

340
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,640
I've been working round the clock with some wonderful people over Q-Podder.com, particularly

341
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,240
the Sky Panther and John Eng.

342
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:55,000
And we have, in the past 24, I was created a brand new website and feed called FagRigator.com.

343
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
That's right.

344
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:05,240
FagRigator, a lagRigator, what it is, is, the way it is twice.

345
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,480
It's all of the queer and queer friendly video podcasts all in one feed.

346
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,960
So when you get to your video, I potto if you just want to watch it at home on your

347
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,520
video and you don't want to pay for shit.

348
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,840
We will offer you this.

349
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,080
We've been holding on a second, Madge episodes of Lost are not shit.

350
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,880
The only downside is that they only allowed if you're a member of the US store.

351
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,240
I just watched another episode of Lost Last Night and we're a season behind here and

352
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,240
so I'm pining for that and it's time to open up a US account on the Apple iTunes store.

353
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,480
So don't knock that, that part I think is really good, that's not shit, it's a damn

354
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
good show.

355
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,520
Already been, the Q-Pod of Folks have already been creating video podcasts for some

356
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
time.

357
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,520
We've all been doing it for months and you can already subscribe to FagRigator and see

358
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,480
all of our wonderful videos and these same missexuals are very creative items carry.

359
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,360
You should let us give you a blowjob sometime, not me, but this person named Young Blood

360
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
is something anyway.

361
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
That's another story.

362
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,840
I don't do that sort of thing in the world.

363
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,240
You should send me that story, man.

364
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,280
That's been, I don't know what I'm talking about, forget that.

365
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:25,120
But anyway, FagRigator.com, you can subscribe to it at feeds.feedbunner.com slash

366
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
aggregator.

367
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
FagRigator.

368
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,320
And it should be an iTunes soon, I just submitted it.

369
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,720
It's all happening so fast, so fast, this is so exciting, I am very, very excited about

370
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,240
this video podcasting and my black video iPod is on its way.

371
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,400
And by the way, Adam, I really, you can cut this off anytime I don't need to talk

372
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
for the whole time.

373
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,520
But I really, really hold on, I wouldn't be a good podcaster if I tried to hide something.

374
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,720
The fun is all on the stuff that you don't want to put on the air.

375
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,880
Really need a car, I am tired of driving around my fat ass on the bicycle.

376
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,560
Can you please get somebody to sponsor me and my fucking show, give me a car and that's

377
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,200
all I'll fucking talk about.

378
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,440
You don't even have to, like, I don't even have to tell them I'm sponsored and I'll

379
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,800
just talk about it all the time with something.

380
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,040
Anyway, that's probably something you won't want to play on the show, but I don't care

381
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
if you do it.

382
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,240
It's up to you, it's just show and talking to God too much.

383
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,600
Anyway, thanks Adam.

384
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Talk to you soon.

385
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Hey, baby.

386
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Thank you, honey.

387
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,520
But yeah, imagine, Skype me when I was an Amsterdam and I actually said, oh, I'll be right

388
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,120
with you two days later, I've gotten back to her, I miss she's not angry.

389
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,080
You know how lesbians can get well, so of course I subscribe to the Fagrogator and it

390
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
works.

391
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,820
There's just a whole bunch of videos sitting there and my items, I don't have a video

392
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,820
iPod.

393
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,000
Well, I'll look at one when I'm out in San Francisco, I'll go to the Apple store, maybe

394
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
you'll look at it.

395
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,960
But now I'm confused because I thought I really wanted the Nano and I was convinced

396
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,560
that there would not be a video iPod yet.

397
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,440
I was so convinced, man, was I wrong.

398
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:06,080
And I don't know, I don't know, sorry, my brain fried.

399
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,560
I owe an apology to Sarah at the Wall Street Journal as a few listeners pointed out because

400
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,560
she was so sure that there was going to be a video iPod announcement.

401
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,520
It's funny because she was so sure that I said to her, look, you know, I could be wrong.

402
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,560
But unless Walt Mossberg knows something that you can't tell me without killing me later,

403
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,440
then I think it's new power books.

404
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
And I guess that's it.

405
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,480
I guess that the Wall Street Journal knew well ahead of time what was what was going to happen.

406
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,200
But I own a apology to her because I was convinced it was going to be the new power

407
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
book.

408
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,160
So now the story is starting to kind of unfold.

409
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,520
And apparently there was some issues with the new power that last line of power PC,

410
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,000
the power books Apple is going to bring out.

411
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,440
They couldn't get the 1.7 gigahertz processor to work properly.

412
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
Some buggy's going on.

413
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,920
And that's mainly because an Apple, you'd be surprised how small the development teams are.

414
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,280
But all the resources, of course, are working on the Intel version of the new power books

415
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,480
and max.

416
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,840
So that's a reason why they couldn't stop on the bugs quick enough apparently.

417
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,000
This is what I read in the papers this morning here.

418
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What was it?

419
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Did I think it was financial times?

420
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I think so.

421
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,400
So that's why those have been delayed.

422
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,920
But they'll probably be coming out next Wednesday.

423
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,280
I already heard rumors that there's going to be an announcement and that'll be those final

424
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
power books.

425
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,040
So I guess I'm going to pick up one of those because I'm sure it'll be at least, I don't

426
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,400
think they'll get the Intel power books out by Christmas.

427
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,160
Oh, would not be awesome.

428
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,800
They might, they might.

429
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,240
So I'll just have to purchase a new power book.

430
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,640
But I was bummed out because here I am, you know, we've gone through this.

431
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,760
I've been an unofficial beta tester for Apple since, well, actually my dad did have an

432
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,080
Apple 2, but I never really got into it much.

433
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:03,200
But, you know, the Mac Plus and the ED in the 512k and whatever and the 2 effects and

434
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,840
the black and white power books and the logbill, I mean, I've owned them all.

435
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,120
I mean, just none of them, maybe I've spent, you know, $50 to $100,000 an Apple product.

436
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,600
It could be totally possible if you're talking about, you know, not just the computers

437
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,640
but whatever other paraphernalia that goes along with it.

438
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,960
And so that was a new G5 power, I'm Mac and I just bought an I'm Mac and the sales

439
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
guy didn't know.

440
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,320
He didn't know to tell me to wait for like two days, I was really pissed off.

441
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,120
Well, it happens to me all the time, but I was glad that I, you know, that I waited with

442
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,920
the power book because we are going to get the new power books and I guess at the end

443
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,080
of the day, it's cool because there is a new iPod that's also a cool church key to have.

444
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:55,880
So after I subscribe to the Faggregator, I ran across this video cast, which actually,

445
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,520
I think Meguseg is going to play the video for me, but you will definitely get the audio.

446
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Let's see if this works.

447
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,120
Five months ago, I bought my new I'm Mac G5 for 1799.

448
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,960
I'm about a month later, I got the new I site camera so I could do video conferencing.

449
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,760
The one this is up on top of the monitor.

450
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,120
I'm about a month and a half later, I got the new I'm 90 miles for 50 bucks.

451
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,440
If you add those all together, you're looking at about $2,000.

452
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:31,600
Now I steam job, I now it's a good even a faster I Mac with the built-in I site and I'm

453
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,440
mighty mouse included for 1699 for the 20 inch.

454
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,880
Thanks, I held a lot Steve, I won't my $300 difference back.

455
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,800
And now all you people that are buying the new I pod video, you can watch me ran and

456
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,600
rape about it on your new I pod.

457
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,240
So all of you that are getting that great deal for 1699, you can go after yourself.

458
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,480
See you later.

459
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,200
Alright, so I don't know about the doing that on an I site that doesn't really work for audio.

460
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,840
Hey guys, if you're going to do video casting, excellent, awesome, I love it, but please

461
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,640
make sure you mic yourself up, you know, get a get a love mic or something because

462
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,080
it's really blows.

463
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,600
Anyway, I totally agree on this stuff too, I mean, it's not about the $300 difference

464
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:31,840
whatever, but you know, shoot man, and we even discussed about all the inventory had dried

465
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,640
up so you almost could have known, but I didn't expect that.

466
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,920
Anyway, let me see here I have a couple more email messages from the Gmail about that.

467
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,520
Let me see Joel, the cloth one says, yeah, Apple did release new I Mac, it's a GFI with

468
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,200
an I site camera built in new video card and remote control as well.

469
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,200
And he says take your GFI back and get the new one.

470
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,160
I don't wonder if you can do that, can you go back and say, hey, I feel bone, I wonder.

471
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,680
It seems like a, seems like I'm not really going to want to do it.

472
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,480
And this is Liam, Liam Gladi, we actually sent me a link to the Apple Insider who are

473
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,480
pretty bold about their statements and they have a whole article, a whole blog post and

474
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,480
you just bring it up here about the new power books and oh, this is where I read it.

475
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,680
Okay, so I thought it was the newspaper, but Apple Insider actually, almost second, I just

476
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,960
got a pop-up window for Apple Insider, great guys, thanks.

477
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Right, here we go.

478
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,680
Let's just see if there's anything that missed, 17 inch models will support a native resolution

479
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,120
of near 1920 by 1200 pixels.

480
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,480
That's nice.

481
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:50,400
They'll have a faster hard drives, larger hard drives, it's a, it's a good article actually.

482
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,520
Oh, and so apparently before that happens, we're going to get a new software upgrade and

483
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,640
OSX 10.4.3 update.

484
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,600
I remember all those years of being a Mac enthusiast and no one really gave a shit.

485
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:15,840
They didn't care, like you and your damn Mac, don't care at all.

486
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,640
Alrighty, so I got one more promo here, actually a couple more, and a few more things

487
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,400
I'm going to talk about, and more podcasts music on the way.

488
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:34,680
Hi, I'm Adam, I did my first podcast in the Canadian Arctic, in the middle of nowhere.

489
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,320
It's an excellent podcast, it's called Windy and my little friend.

490
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm a bit dedicated to it, I'm not coaching much.

491
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm going to be very explicit, I'm going to see how I'm doing all the things I've been doing

492
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
in my first episode.

493
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,600
I love playing promos, in languages I can't or primarily understand it.

494
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:06,720
I heard explicit, I think, explicit.

495
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,680
I heard, hmm, heard that in there.

496
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,200
I think I played what a Finnish man, I knew it was dragon them.

497
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:22,280
I heard that and there, I think I played what a finished promo the other day, and I got

498
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,360
a couple emails from Finn and saying, you know, dude, that wasn't like an entirely family

499
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:33,600
safe promo, I don't know what the guy was talking about, but it's cool to see podcasts

500
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
from all over the world.

501
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,800
And it's interesting to see that France is up and coming, and actually it may not even be

502
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:48,840
that crazy, you know that, was this from Canada, but in France, they really have

503
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
a tight control on their media.

504
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,040
And we used to talk about this, the French actually, so if you look at the three television

505
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,640
systems that still exists today, of course, everything's going digital now, high definition.

506
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,640
You have the NTSC standard in the United States, and of course, the States is so big,

507
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,280
that, you know, that's not really seen as a protectionist move, and of course, well, you know,

508
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:21,000
who kind of developed television, but the better standard with high resolution is pal, that's

509
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,920
what the most of the rest of the world uses, and then you have C-Cam, and C-Cam is what France

510
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,760
has used, and I believe they still use it, and you just, you know, you can't receive a French

511
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,440
program, and back in the day, a French video cassette would not work, unless you had a multi-standard

512
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,600
VCR and television, but really, you know, it's because they have, I don't know what the

513
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,680
percentage is, but it's a high percentage of French content only, so they really want to protect

514
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:55,240
their culture, which is now, there's a lot to be said for that, and Canada has some similar rules,

515
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:02,200
I believe, but Patricia and Ivan or Sister were there for three days when they went to the

516
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:09,000
Chanel show, and they said it was, it was just unwatchable, it was just cry, it was really,

517
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,400
really horrible, and you only have like, you know, three or four channels, and I think the radio is

518
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,840
probably in the similar state, although you do have energy and RJ, which is a pretty hot station

519
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,320
in France, but maybe just maybe the word of podcasting is started to infiltrate, so I'm looking

520
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,120
forward, let's see if we can press that through and see what comes out of France, they got a lot of

521
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,280
culture there, that's for sure, a lot of stuff that we just haven't been exposed to, and I missed

522
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,160
the French, Chanel, Chanel, once in a while, and I wanted to point you to an article written about

523
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:48,200
MTV that Nicky Fink, and I KKI, F-I-N-K-E, she writes for the LA Weekly Magazine, it's also available

524
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,160
online, and she interviewed me for this piece, but it's about how music has left MTV, and I

525
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,680
got really excited when she was asking me all these questions for this interview, because

526
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,520
I think, wow, here's a journalist who understands it, she has 10 million readers, I mean,

527
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:07,160
it's a huge publication, and she's syndicated in multiple publications, and you know, so of course

528
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,440
we started talking about podcasting, and that article's not about podcasting, but she will be doing

529
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,160
one, I think, and she also wants to do her own podcast, and she's done radio, and I'm really

530
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,000
excited about bringing her into our community, because here's someone who just rags and rants

531
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:28,440
and raves about mainstream media all the time, and she's spot on, she pointed me to another article,

532
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:35,000
she wrote about the media coverage of Katrina, check her out, definitely, Nicky Fink, and look for

533
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,800
her at a podcast, you know, you very soon.

534
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:56,520
It's an ever-ending highway, life, dust and diesel, but there's a rest stop on the side of the road,

535
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:05,800
a sanctuary of songs for the spirit of your mind, hit the brakes, and take a seat at the U-turn

536
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:21,320
cafe, the U-turn cafe, with your host, CC Chapman, find it at U-turncathay.com

537
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,000
this is Dr. Larry Payne of another night shift, the emergency medicine podcast,

538
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,240
you can find my website at www.anothernightshift.com, or you can subscribe through iTunes.

539
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,680
Before we go any further, let's just get this over with right now. Yes, my name really is Dr. Payne.

540
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,720
Yes, I hear about it from my patients about 20 times a day, but you know, I went to medical school

541
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,040
with a guy named Tom Hurt, a guy named Joe Die, and I think I got off fairly easily.

542
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,440
I've practiced emergency medicine for over 22 years, my podcasts include content for emergency

543
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,520
physicians as well as anyone that's trying to hack through the jungle of modern medicine,

544
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,480
and I'm also eager to respond to listener comments and questions. I think personally that podcasting

545
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,440
is a perfect way to reach patients in other physicians. What I can't do though is diagnose,

546
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,320
treat, or prescribe in my podcasts. I'm not going to prescribe anything like those ads you might see

547
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:28,040
in your inbox every day, Adam, like for Viagro, Cialis, not that you'd ever need any of that stuff anyway.

548
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,680
Adam, you are over 40 now, you just had another birthday, and you never know when you're going to

549
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,000
start to need to think about these things. Maybe we should just talk some time. But anyway, I love talking

550
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,720
about emergency medicine, and I hope everybody will subscribe, listen, and learn along with me.

551
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,880
Once again, my name is Dr. Larry Payne. I've been called a pain in the neck, a pain in the well,

552
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,120
use your imagination. Once again, this is the another night shift emergency medicine podcast.

553
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,840
My website is www.anothernightshift.com, and you can subscribe there or just click on the icon

554
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,880
and items. I look forward to speaking to you again soon, and thanks for having me on the daily

555
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,600
source code. And we are just getting started with all the possibilities that podcast and

556
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:18,760
can bring us. That is clear. Thank you, Dr. Payne. Uh-huh. I have unfortunate name for the

557
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,160
profession, indeed. That's great, though. And do you notice how lots of doctors are really

558
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,560
media ready? I mean, is that just me? Or, I mean, you see, of course, all these make-over shows,

559
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,320
and ugly duckling shows, and stuff like that, and all these doctors really know how to sell it.

560
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:43,560
I think that it's because they, they really know how to talk to people. So, yeah, that's a podcast

561
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,000
I'll subscribe to. I don't know if it'll bring me down. I hate hearing about sickness and illness.

562
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,120
That's not good. But that's what we're going to see. I think it's so clear. Even I am still operating

563
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:02,280
under kind of a hybrid of the old model of broadcasting, and we're seeing things, and

564
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:11,640
we're literally seeing giants shift overnight. There's just so much incredibly exciting stuff happening.

565
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,320
What's going on with Yama? What's the vibe on that? I like what they're doing with tagging. That's

566
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:24,200
kind of cool. That's, that's rather interesting. Has anyone swapped it out and is anyone using it

567
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,760
as, as a directory, or are people still, it doesn't quite work well on search yet. I think that they

568
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,680
have an index everything yet, because if you, if you do a search on a topic, although I think they

569
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:44,600
are indexing show notes, but if you do a search on a topic, or just a name of a show, you get maybe

570
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,720
an episode from July or from June. For instance, if you do Adam Currier daily source code,

571
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:55,720
of course, the feed pops up, and the show we can subscribe, but the episode, it picks a

572
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,960
couple of miles. I'm not quite sure how that works yet, but I'd like to hear some feedback. Let me know

573
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:09,240
what your experiences are with Yahoo. Okay. Earlier in the week, I played a tune. I was really

574
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:16,280
excited about this artist that entered the Podsake Music Network. Excuse me. With this Friday

575
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,840
vibe, it's a little bit dreary outside, a little bit rainy. I figured I'd listen to a couple more

576
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,560
of her tracks. Actually, I have now downloaded every single one of the tracks that you put up

577
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,880
on the Podsake Music Network, and I think what I should just do is just go buy and buy the album,

578
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:40,520
because this is good stuff. Of course, I'm a sucker for a bit of jazz. Robin Stein, a shy boy.

579
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:08,200
Will be my boy. You irresistible kiss of you. It's time to stop this flirtation

580
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:22,040
in the conversation. You don't need to be shy with me shy boy. Now you're my boy.

581
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:28,520
And you're not so shy anymore.

582
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:15,320
Yeah, time to stop this flirtation in the conversation. You don't need to be shy with me shy boy.

583
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:30,600
Now you're my boy. And you're not so shy anymore. No, you're not so shy anymore.

584
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:40,040
You know what I mean, you're not so shy anymore. For the Podsake Music Network,

585
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:48,840
at music.podshow.com, Robin Stein. You're not such a shy boy anymore. Cool. I love it.

586
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,240
Do the genre sort when you're on the Podsake Music Network. Just look at all the different songs.

587
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:59,160
There are all the different genres. It's not just angry indie rock. When it comes to Podsake Music,

588
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,840
it's really something there for everybody. Okay, thank you very much for checking the show

589
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,440
out. Once again, atomacurry.com for feedback. And if you want to send me off a promo,

590
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,800
fantastic. I love to play it. Stick it up on a web server somewhere. Don't forget your ID3 tag

591
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,160
so that I can identify what the hell it is. And in the software that I'm using. And of course,

592
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,880
for if you're not already subscribed to this podcast, you can go to dailysourcecode.com.

593
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,720
You find the podcast feed there. You can also search it in in iTunes, of course. And who knows?

594
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,280
Where in the future, you'll be able to search for podcasts and be driven towards fun things to

595
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:43,960
listen to. We will assimilate you and control you. Everybody, if I don't talk to you over the weekend,

596
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:50,200
Monday, definitely, as I said, find a San Francisco actually going up to Redmond for a meeting

597
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,520
early in the week. And I'll be telling you all about that. So take care. Have a great.

598
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:05,880
Ffff! Reek it. Another podshow podcast. Stick it in your ear.
