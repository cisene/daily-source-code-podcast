1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey everybody, it's Sunday the 3rd.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh my goodness, once again time for a daily source code coming to you from the balcony

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of Kri Kondo here in Lovely South Beach, Florida.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's 930 on Sunday night.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, so immediately you're probably saying hey, wait a minute something sounds a little

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
bit different.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This doesn't sound like the typical daily source code sound we're used to.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That is because I have been officially assimilated and this podcast is being produced

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
on a Windows XP tablet.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I never thought I'd actually see the day.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Of course the sound difference is not just because of the tablet although someone

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't come from there, but I'm also recording this on a headset with a microphone

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to reduce background noise.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is of course also reduces quality.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It also seems like the sound card is just so different in this laptop.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's really the sound is booming.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It already turned off the extra bass or whatever it is that it is all kinds.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I mean I have learned so incredibly much in the past couple of days.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'd posted on my weblog that I had purchased a tablet PC and was learning the

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
joys of Windows.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Of course I worked with Windows before.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's not like I don't know how Windows works and you can kind of figure it out.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But boy, there's a lot of stuff that has changed since the last time I...

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I guess my last Windows install was what Windows 2000 professional or something like that

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
or maybe Server 2003.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not quite sure clearly some older version of Windows.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's amazing when all the stuff I'm finding here.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There's mixers and all kinds of extra sound controls.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And boy, boy is there a lot of software available.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Of course I knew that.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Being a Mac guy usually wind up.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know, going to a couple places like a version tracker if you want to find something

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but for Windows.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Dude, there's so much software available.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I spent a lot of time looking at recording software.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Actually not just recording.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe I should step back a little bit.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
First of all, I wanted to get a small laptop and I wanted to be specifically

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Windows based for a number of reasons.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
One is I wanted to make this laptop my communications laptop and leave the power book

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
kind of as the content machine.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Which of course kind of flows back and forth.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not really one or the other, right?

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So the first thing I had to figure out is, okay, how do I connect things?

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself again.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So when I was looking around, what is it?

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Comp USA and circuit city and looking at different laptops and loving the prices of course.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know, $1,000 laptop is 500 pounds and you can't get anything for 500 pounds

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
in the way of laptops in the UK.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So the conversion rate really works in my favor.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I looked at the Sony VIO and then, you know, it seems like there's a whole bunch

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
of these tablet PCs that people really aren't buying anymore and kind of gone out of

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Vogue.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And therefore, they're probably their price better and they come with a whole bunch of stuff.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So I went to software included and I'd seen them before.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Actually, it was a Werner Fogels.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think it is.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Fogels are Fogels.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, Werner, who actually now I think believe he's, no, I know his chief technology officer over at Amazon.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I saw him working on a tablet PC and I was pretty impressed.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It was a big one and this is a small, you know, it's like a 14 inch screen, which for a

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
whole time.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now, of course, the screen goes blank.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There we go.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Everything's still working.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So when you use it in, what is it?

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Portrait mode, I guess it is.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So you have kind of the, as a rectangle up and down.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's portrait mode, isn't it?

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, portrait.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, then it's really quite handy.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It fits in the palm of your hand.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Of course, the screen turns around, folds back over the keyboard.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It can't be underestimated, but I am very impressed with the handwriting recognition,

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
different ways of inputting.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Very impressed with this application.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It comes bundled with what is it called?

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's the Microsoft Office OneNote 2003.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All the software in here is from 2003, which is basically note taking software.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And you can just write jot down notes by hand.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can transcribe that to turn it into text.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It does a pretty good job.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
When I found out it was really cool.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You don't have to translate it to text, but then you do a search looking for something.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It'll still go through and find the text in your handwriting, which is pretty damn

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
spiffy, actually.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So I like that a lot.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know, what other things, you know, it just been, oh, I was able to connect

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
to the Mac pretty easily.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Just turned Windows, file sharing on on the Mac.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And once you figure out this black slash stuff, which seems so counter-intuitive

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
to anything internet related, it looks like you're making a mistake.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can actually, I mounted my account, my drive from the laptop that we brought

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
with us the Mac.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So I was able to bring over like the rock money and off opener.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I was able to just suck that over.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That works fine.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And of course, then, you start to set up a couple things.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Skype, the Skype Windows client is without a doubt superior to the Mac.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can add people in chats.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just the whole way at works is, at the same much nicer.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Of course, the development curve is probably a little bit ahead on the Windows side

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
if not a lot.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And it makes a perfect big cell phone, actually, because now this tablet,

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you can walk around, you can take notes, you can answer the phone calls.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Email works.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I've been writing out emails with the tablet by hand.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you're just writing off little notes, it's great.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think once you get into a little more structured writing,

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
it's not just about the way you, I mean,

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the typing is an essential part of the creative process somehow.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So it's kind of necessary.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I could see where I could slip over a little bit and do more and more

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
hand writing just with the pen on the tablet.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have horrible hand writing, and it still turns out pretty nice.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So, of course, the next thing that is logical that I was going to do is

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
record a podcast with this and start to learn what it takes,

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
what kind of software is out there.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There is a lot of software.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But the first thing I discovered, which no one really talked about that much,

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think it's something that's always been in Windows,

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is this is the volume control panel.

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you have a speaker icon, the bottom of your system tray,

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a double click on it, it'll open up a mixer window with

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
faders, with sliders, slider controls, which is very familiar to me.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You'll have volume control wave, which is essentially

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
every output from every application.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Then you can have CD drive, line in a microphone,

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and the microphone has its own little slider here.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll just tap the pen on it and I can move it down and move it back up

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and it has a little mute, I can turn on and off and that works great.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And particularly with the pen, it's almost like you're grabbing the fader

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
like you would in a radio studio situation.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So, it feels really familiar.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Of course, no software that really doesn't.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There's a Windows sound recorder, I think.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I just hunted around and came up with something really simple.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It was a super MP3 recorder pro, cost 29 bucks if you want to record

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
over 41 seconds worth of audio, which is all the free version does.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Basically, it's a very, very simple application you set it up

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and you set up what source it's supposed to record,

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
so you could say record only the microphone,

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
or in this case it said record the stereo out.

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So everything that normally would be passed off to the speaker

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
is now in addition to going through the headphones for great monitoring

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
really like the fact that I can hear myself

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
is also being recorded by the Super MP3 recorder pro

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and it has a beautiful extra feature to it

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
where once you're done recording you click stop

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and then you can actually edit the file.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's kind of the one stop thing you're looking for.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What it doesn't include is a whole bunchet,

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
like it a real good ID3 tag editor, and of course

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
doesn't know how to upload anything to a server yet.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But I found a lot of these programs.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It seems like a lot of them actually

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
with different just different skins, but very similar.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In fact, they're probably built to the same company

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
but they're called something different.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And it's essence, that's all you really need

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
now that I was not that I realized

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
that you have this little mixer built right into Windows

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
that you can use to determine what goes into this recording device.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I like that a lot.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So now on my screen, I have the MP3 recorder pro open.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Actually, I can just minimize that because

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it shows a handy little task bar icon

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
up there's Patricia boiling the water.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hand little task bar icon that has little view meters

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
so you know that you're actually still recording.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can't want minimize now.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's see, there we go.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Minimize.

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Still recording.

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I have the notebook open

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
so that I have my notes.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Literally.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have my show notes.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I've written up show notes tonight

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
which I guess I'll go back and do some work on now

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that I don't know.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It may really change the whole production process.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's just pretty cool.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But it's also given me a lot of thought.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A lot to think about really is to,

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
what do you need to create a podcast?

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And it seems like this recording part

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
is really much simpler.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Only you have to kind of know where to find everything.

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So I'll put a link obviously to the software.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So you can take a look at that.

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And again, if it's just double clicking on the speaker icon

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
for your volume, normally you click once

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and it opens up a little control fader

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
so you can turn the volume up or down.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So in this case, double click it opens up this volume control

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and under options.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You can, what is it?

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let me see.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can also do it live on here with the under options.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's properties.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then properties you can select which controls you want on this window.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So now I only have three open.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I could have the line in if I added it.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But it's the main volume control out.

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's the wave.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So that's everything from the applications.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And it's microphone.

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And that's really all you need.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Of course, what it lacks is a way to process

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the microphone sound.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So you kind of get whatever you put into it,

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
which is what you hear right now.

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I read ping-win.com.

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I are a TE ping-win.com.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Check it out.

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I could use the little old cowbell and G.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Really explore the studio space this time.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay, you can tell I just picked up a couple of promos here

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I had to tag them all in my Gmail as daily source code stuff.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And I figured I just got as much out of the way as I possibly could.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What I'm doing now is I'm literally using the pen on the tablet.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So at the see the next promo is it says podcast promo with little Charlie.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So all I do is just double tap on it and it plays.

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Hey, I can move Charlie.

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I can leave my microphone.

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm Charlie and I catch on out here records.

229
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And then I get tired of trying to surf and have looking for

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
worthless sites that don't help me at all.

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to hear the real blues.

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I check out Burdo on Bandanna Blues.

233
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's here.

234
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think that about Seth.

235
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Burdo here.

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Senior contributing editor for Burdo's wax magazine.

237
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Bringing you the best in 21st century blues.

238
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And the old masters.

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Subscribe to the podcast and find out about our 15th Annual Bandanna Blues.

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll near Philly August 6th.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Right.

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So it works.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Clearly.

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Now it shouldn't play on.

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Right.

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay.

248
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So actually it's cool.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It actually queues up the next one.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So then I'll have to do it.

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Just hit play.

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, that's beautiful.

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So I'm learning more about Windows.

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Media player as well.

255
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I just got to reconnect to my Wi-Fi here.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's kind of lame though in Windows web.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And when you got a low battery or if you lose your Wi-Fi connectivity,

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
when it comes back in, it'll tell you that with a little balloon that pops up.

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But I think the battery should say, you know,

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
plug in your power supply or recharge your battery whatever.

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And when you plug it in like on the Mac, then that just,

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that that warning dialogue goes away.

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It doesn't do that on Windows, which is kind of sad.

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'd written something down here in the show notes.

265
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Let me see.

266
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, yeah.

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The pilot review is shoot.

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I didn't do my well.

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Good.

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And then you get a little sound seeing tour here.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So I've got the tablet on my left arm.

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I'm just walking on the balcony.

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's like a new way to do a sound seeing tour.

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I just need a different set of headphones.

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's a plane going up overhead.

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm at the edge of the balcony here.

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can hear the sounds of South Beach at night.

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's a beautiful night.

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It was kind of chilly today by floor to standards.

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It was like 70, low 70s.

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We had a rainy day yesterday.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is actually not bad.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I just wish I had a less conspicuous headset.

285
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I've got like, you know, pilot headset on.

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's literally what this looks like.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Speaking of which, let me get that magazine home on a second.

288
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Let me see, which one it was.

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It was a really funny article I wanted to share with you.

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Was this the one?

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, in a second.

292
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
See now I have to look at.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's not in the index.

294
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The condo we're renting.

295
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
See if there's just 10 minutes and time.

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Is owned by a quite a famous architect actually.

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And she is a fixed wing pilot.

298
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And she was nice enough to leave a couple of her AOPA pilot magazines laying around,

299
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
which he said she did intentionally because she knew I was a pilot.

300
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And there was an article in here that I really wanted to share with you

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
because it was absolutely fascinating stuff all along.

302
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, fascinating maybe.

303
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
A little bit over the top.

304
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Damn.

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What the hell?

306
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay, let me look in the index here for a second.

307
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Um.

308
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, that's probably why you're never again.

309
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But for a test pilot, hang or talk.

310
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No, no, no, no.

311
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Shoot.

312
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Shoot if prep this better for you.

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Um.

314
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hold on.

315
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let me just check the other index.

316
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm going to wash up the skip that and do it the next time.

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Do.

318
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I like so can't find this.

319
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I hate that.

320
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay.

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I promise I'll prep better the next time.

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, I'll tell you what it was.

323
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Um, so this is a pilot's magazine and they put all kinds of stuff in there.

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Like, you know, the stuff, the 10 minutes I'll never forget the thing that I did really wrong

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
fucked up and lived to tell the story.

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You know, basic stuff like that.

327
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And in there, and I'll, and I'll look it up after after the show.

328
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And I'll do it on tomorrow's podcast, I promise.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Um, it was a story about different superstar clients who fly on private jets.

330
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Basically, the pilot's kissing and telling about who was really nice and who's a real shithead.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now, I can give you one guess about one superstar performer who is considered the worst human being by all

332
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
an aviation who have ever flown her.

333
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That would be Mariah Carey.

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So I'll make sure I find that.

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I should have prep that better.

337
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Um, but it's an excellent excellent article.

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Uh, so I'll make sure I find that.

339
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And we'll talk about on tomorrow's podcast.

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
My name is Patrick McLean, and every week I write and produce the shoniki.

341
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's a podcast that takes its name from a Celtic word, meaning storyteller.

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And to give you an idea of what it's like, I've written a 28 second episode.

343
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's called Rusty Bender.

344
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The 10 man goes out drinking with a scarecrow and wakes up in the cornfield covered in dew.

345
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And he realizes the reason the scarecrow always drinks him under the table is that his belly is filled with straw.

346
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Alcohol, soap, straw.

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So he creaks off in search of a match.

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He's going to show that scarecrow.

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay.

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Lots of cool podcasts to check out.

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why does that sound so nice?

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay.

355
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's kind of cool.

356
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay.

357
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So I made a mistake there on Windows Media Play.

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If you double tap the song, then it just plays that track.

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If you hit play, then it will actually play the one after that.

360
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like it's starting a playlist.

361
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Something I got in was like recordings of old AM radio stations from the 70s.

362
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah.

363
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's a big stuff.

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's pretty cool.

365
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
All right.

366
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay.

367
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So fine.

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Let's see.

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What else did I learn while we're here in the States?

370
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, had a little interesting experience with Simphone Locks.

371
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't know if you've ever had a cell phone, a GSM phone, and wanted to use a different

372
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
service provider.

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Actually, I believe it's outlawed.

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Or now I found out what the real law is in Europe.

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You know, the phones for many, many years in most countries were subsidized.

376
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So you'd pay your monthly phone rental time or whatever.

377
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And then you pay by minute, obviously.

378
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And you could sometimes get a phone for free or at a reduced rate.

379
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And the way they do that is you couldn't basically switch to a different provider if you did.

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Then the phone will just say it's locked and it won't accept a different SIM card.

381
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The SIM card is basically all the little chip card that contains all the data about you in your account.

382
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And often, of course, it contains phone numbers, limited amount, but it contains, you know, some phone numbers.

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And we all have GSM phones with Virgin Mobile.

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And while we're in, you know, here's the pricing.

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's one pound, what was it?

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There's one pound 40 per minute to call anywhere using your Virgin Mobile while roaming in the states.

387
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
89 pens, I think.

388
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So that's almost $2.

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's like a dollar, a dollar or 80 per minute incoming.

390
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It was like, you know, it's money, you know, that's an incredible amount.

391
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And of course, he was Skype all the time.

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
My in-laws are staying back at the cottage.

393
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They've been taking care of the pets and looking after everything.

394
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And we just call them on Skype.

395
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Patricia puts the headphones on and they've got the Skype telephone over there.

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So it rings with them.

397
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's just like a regular phone, you know, nothing special.

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But we still wanted to have US numbers while we're here.

399
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So we could call each other.

400
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So I went to T Mobile.

401
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And they allowed it to just purchase a SIM card with a phone number on it.

402
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And it was great.

403
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You know, that was a reasonably simple process.

404
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Although I couldn't buy three SIM cards at once had to buy and pay for each one each time,

405
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
which totally sucked.

406
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And then I put it into my Sony.

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The Sony Ericsson, the, was it the 700i.

408
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And no problem.

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Booted right up.

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I was often calling.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And then I put it into Christina and Patricia's phone and it got SIM locked.

412
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And I thought that that was illegal.

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It turns out the actual law is if you've spent a minimum of 30 pounds with the current provider.

414
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
They have to unlock your phone by law.

415
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So I called them up and they said, yeah, no problem explaining the situation.

416
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah, no problem.

417
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And they checked.

418
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And of course, we spent more than 30 pounds on both of those accounts.

419
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
By the way, mine was not locked because it's much harder apparently to SIM lock.

420
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So in Ericsson, that is a Nokia.

421
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So that's, that's a little, a little clue for you for the future.

422
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And then Christina's unlocked with the code the gaming book.

423
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It could never get Patricia's to unlock, which sucked.

424
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And I sent her to another email, didn't hear back from.

425
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So whatever.

426
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But man, that wasn't quite as simple as I thought it would be.

427
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And I discovered, as I said, that the law is not that they have to open it up to you,

428
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and to use with a different provider.

429
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They only have to do that if you've spent a minimum of 30 pounds in order for them.

430
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So that's a $60 in order for them to recoup their investment on the phone, I guess.

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So of course, Pope John Paul, the second passed away.

432
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I've, you know, here in the States is so much television, including the high definition channels,

433
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
which is kind of trippy.

434
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It looks kind of like, you know, European television.

435
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Quality wise.

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Not content wise.

437
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But knowing that we have a Catholic podcast amongst us, I was paying particular attention

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
to the Catholic insider and to Father Roderick's Catholic insider.com podcast.

439
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let's just listen to a little bit of that because it really was, it really was quite special.

440
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Just to hear, to hear someone be so involved physically because he jumped on a plane and went to Rome,

441
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
but also emotionally.

442
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, hold on. Let's screw that up. Let me try that again.

443
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Darn.

444
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay.

445
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Problem here is I didn't have the fader open. Let's try it again.

446
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Catholic insider April 2, 2005, midnight edition.

447
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Thank you very much.

448
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Thank you very much.

449
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Thank you very much.

450
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hi everybody. Welcome to this extra podcast from Rome.

451
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I am Father Roderick.

452
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This evening, I will take you to the Vatican where we will witness the reaction of the 50,000 people

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:15,000
gathered there to the news that Pope John Paul II has passed away.

454
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I am standing on the roof of the Dutch college and in the distance you can hear the bells of Rome.

455
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The Pope has died. The announcement has been made a couple of minutes ago.

456
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The bells of the St. Peter have started and now all the churches follow the example.

457
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And soon all the bells in Rome and all over the world will be ringing to honor this great Pope

458
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that has passed away.

459
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That's a part I like best man where you hear the dog barking in the car driving by in the distance.

460
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In the distance I can see the dome of the St. Peter of the Basilica and there the people mourn the departure of this great man.

461
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And it can hear more and more bells starting to ring.

462
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's everywhere.

463
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So I suggest you definitely go over and check out the Catholic Insider Catholic Insider.com

464
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Father Roderick really, you know, actually when I hear this podcast or podcast like this,

465
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
it reminds me a lot of before we had the word podcast and Dave Slusher was doing evil genius chronicles

466
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and we're going back and forth. He would say something on his show and then I would say something on mine.

467
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Talking about the name was an audio blog.

468
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I think Dave Slusher at the time said bundles of passion.

469
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And I was thinking, you know, that's really, it is a good, it's not a sexy marketing like word,

470
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
but it's a very good description of what that kind of podcast is.

471
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You know, it really truly is a bundle of passion, just absolutely beautiful to listen to that.

472
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So thanks to all for not berating me about barely doing any podcast this week.

473
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll probably do another one with Ron on the balcony tomorrow night before we take off because on Tuesday we go back to London.

474
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm going to be there for actually I'm going to be there for just a couple days.

475
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm coming back again.

476
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Back in New York on Monday because things are heating up and we're getting ready to, you know,

477
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
to come out as it were.

478
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah, that's the right word to come out.

479
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So thank you very much.

480
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's been a beautiful vacation for us.

481
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The weather has been great.

482
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Long live wireless, you know, that let's you kind of still be a part of the family and

483
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
the gapingings and and still, you know, get some stuff done.

484
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Really, my two girls have been great.

485
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Patricia and Christina, they've let me slip off and have secret meetings with Ron and, you know, run around and get on Skype conference calls.

486
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
God, I have to say it again, man, Skype, what an invention.

487
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I hope those guys become billionaires.

488
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's so incredibly cool what they've done.

489
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
What's Patricia, she's coming out here and see what she's got going on.

490
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What you got there?

491
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, thank you.

492
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
A cup of tea and a candle.

493
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah, it's lovely.

494
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's a problem with this microphone is when I want to drink something.

495
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah.

496
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It kind of gets in the way.

497
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What do you think of my, my setup here?

498
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Hot, oh shit.

499
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh, is your nose.

500
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Huh?

501
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, is your nose.

502
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
My nose.

503
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That's not my nose.

504
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That's not my nose.

505
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's not my nose.

506
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Thank you, hon.

507
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah.

508
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's beautiful.

509
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeah, now it's perfect.

510
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's the perfect night for a podcast.

511
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yes.

512
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We have to do another PPP.

513
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yes.

514
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yes, we do that.

515
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We can get back home.

516
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
PPP is on vacation.

517
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
PPP is on vacation.

518
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
H to the sea is out here.

519
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Pizza, pizza.

520
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Pizza, pizza.

521
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Okay.

522
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There you go.

523
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That's the difference between my wife and me.

524
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Hmm.

525
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Okay.

526
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drink a little bit of my tea here.

527
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And the meantime, let me play a mashup for you.

528
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
This is one that came in.

529
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh, man.

530
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'll go have to go look that up again in the show notes.

531
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's done by a fault side.

532
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And it's called let keen in.

533
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It is basically a mashup.

534
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Whoa.

535
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Of Paul McCartney and keen.

536
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
No catch on when you hear him.

537
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The mix is just absolutely phenomenal.

538
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drink a little bit of my tea.

539
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drink a little bit of my tea.

540
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drink a little bit of my tea.

541
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drink a little bit of my tea.

542
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drink a little bit of my tea.

543
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drink a little bit of my tea.

544
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drink a little bit of my tea.

545
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired

546
00:30:44,000 --> 00:31:14,000
getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of being tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired of getting tired

547
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's so fun to me

548
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's so fun to me

549
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's so fun to me

550
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Getting time

551
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's so fun to me

552
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's so fun to me

553
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It's so fun to me

554
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's so fun to me

555
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's so fun to me

556
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's so fun to me

557
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's so fun to me

558
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's so fun to me

559
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's so fun to me

560
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It's so fun to me

561
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It's so fun to me

562
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's so fun to me

563
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's so fun to me

564
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's so fun to me

565
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's so fun to me

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's so fun to me

567
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I don't know whether it's just my headphones

568
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
or a sound like it was completely out of phase

569
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
This is something new we'll learn here

570
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It also sounds maybe like a 3D effect on window's media player

571
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,760
on. That's kind of weird. Let keen in, done by a fault side on your daily source code.

572
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,960
And let me hit you with another promo here.

573
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:56,000
Hello and welcome to NapervilleCommerce.com, your community on the internet.

574
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,480
I'm Jeff Namesher, the host of the program here, and I'll be bringing you the news, views,

575
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,000

576
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000

And thanks for tuning in.

580
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That's when radio is really at its best man, when it's in a geographic community.

581
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I mean, that's at least the way I learned how to make radio.

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And now that we have this alternative distribution form,

583
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
if you're making radio at least, which is kind of a community feedback mechanism,

584
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
they of course can go beyond the geographical community and go to the community of interest.

585
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But still, when you do that for a geographical community,

586
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
it's even better.

587
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I love it.

588
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So that's the NapervilleCommerce.com and the podcast.

589
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Something else.

590
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I just have one more promo to play for you.

591
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
This is a great idea.

592
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
We actually, one time Lawrence Lessick released his book.

593
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm forgetting the name of it.

594
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The culture.

595
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Okay, I'll look that up.

596
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And a whole bunch of podcasts.

597
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't know if there weren't even podcasts,

598
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
so just people who were interested jumped in

599
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and each recorded an audio book chapter.

600
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And a couple people, I even, I made an RSS feed out of it

601
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and a couple other people did that as well.

602
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And now comes the very first novel to be published as a podcast.

603
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Deep below a desolate Utah mountain lies the largest platen

604
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
deposit ever discovered.

605
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
A billion dollar fine.

606
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It waits for any company that can draw a world record

607
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
three mile deep mine shaft.

608
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Perth Corps is the company with the technology,

609
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
the resources, and the guts to go after the mother load.

610
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Young executive Colonel Kirkland is the company's driving force,

611
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
pushing himself and those are on him to uncover the mass of treasure.

612
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But at three miles below the surface where the rocks are so hot

613
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
they burn bare skin, something has been waiting for centuries.

614
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Waiting and guarding.

615
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Kirkland and Earth Corps are about to find out first hand just why

616
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
this treasure hasn't ever been on earth.

617
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Earth Corps is the world's first podcast only novel.

618
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You can't buy in stores and you can't peek at the end.

619
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
This serialized action suspense novel with a new episode

620
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000

623
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Okay, I got to remember that one.

624
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It'll have you on the edge of your aggregator.

625
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I love that. What a great turn.

626
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Definitely going to use that.

627
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Hey, and thanks to the guys over at Gmail for doubling the storage.

628
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Now what a great marketing campaign that was.

629
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
All of a sudden you get that little red tab at the top of your Gmail that says

630
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
new features and it says, hey, we're going to infinity plus one.

631
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
If you click on the link and it takes this page where you see the actual

632
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
storage size growing and kind of like a national debt clock and you go

633
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
quick back to your Gmail account.

634
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You can see you have got 1.7 gigs and of course it went up to two gigabytes

635
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and not a moment too soon.

636
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What has it been like six weeks since I haven't been able to do anything with

637
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
MP3 feedback at gmail.com.

638
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So I guess it's wide open again.

639
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Send send in your promo sending your stuff.

640
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But please send it to MP3 feedback at gmail.com.

641
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Since you all have been sending it to adamaccurry.com.

642
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That's great, but now I want to try and keep that for just pure text

643
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
communications.

644
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But man, those guys are another bunch of guys I hope become

645
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
billionaires or wait a minute.

646
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Maybe.

647
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes.

648
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They already are billionaires.

649
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's time.

650
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Once again.

651
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Hey, young.

652
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Hello.

653
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Hey, Adam.

654
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's time for another hit edge.

655
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Then this one is a special version.

656
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Oh, okay.

657
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's a themed one.

658
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So a themed one.

659
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's see if you can figure out what the theme is.

660
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
This is number one.

661
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh, I just, well, of course.

662
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
How do you like your eggs in the morning?

663
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Uh, Dean Martin and Helen O'Connell.

664
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The theme from my morning radio show on radio.

665
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Number two.

666
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
What?

667
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I don't know what idea what that was.

668
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Was that sounded like the, like, the 18th.

669
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And the final one.

670
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Number three.

671
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Two thousand.

672
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Uh, I don't even know what the theme is, young.

673
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Maybe it's the out of phase headphones.

675
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But I have no idea what the ones were.

676
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The theme is not very hard to guess.

677
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Here are the answers.

678
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Curry and the crew.

679
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Right.

680
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Well, Adam, I haven't seen you for a long time.

681
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh, Adam is appointed.

682
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
However, I've been disappointed more often in my life,

683
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
especially in sexual things.

684
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Uh, these are.

685
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That is the news reader, Adam Lungabar,

686
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
who I worked with for a year doing the morning show.

687
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Take a check out the pipes on that guy.

688
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Well, she didn't get interested in something.

689
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Problem with getting hot.

690
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
She's in full school time.

691
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm over bonus with this.

692
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm necessary.

693
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Um, yes.

694
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The music.

695
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
We're going to talk about the music.

696
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I think it had something to do with chicken.

697
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Right?

698
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Chicken wings.

699
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Eggs.

700
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes.

701
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Good to be eggs.

702
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh, actually.

703
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
In the morning.

704
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Yeah.

705
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Eggs in the morning.

706
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Bye.

707
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The voice you hear in the background is, uh,

708
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
methyl fainstrap.

709
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He was, uh,

710
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
another part of the curry in the crew.

711
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I'm sure Alex on their statements is there as well.

712
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't know.

713
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Um,

714
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Good morning, Adam.

715
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Good morning.

716
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Good morning.

717
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Very end the crew without curry because we're the crew.

718
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We agree.

719
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yes.

720
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yeah.

721
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Well, I can tell the listeners who we are.

722
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah.

723
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, as we deal with with Adam.

724
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Mr. Curry.

725
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yes.

726
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Mr. Curry.

727
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Um, well, I'm Mike.

728
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And this is Alex.

729
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Hi there.

730
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And as Alan's.

731
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Hello.

732
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So we're the crew.

733
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And the morning show already over on a guy.

734
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Starting September 2003.

735
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah.

736
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
We're still September 2004.

737
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It was called Curry in the crew with Curry being curry.

738
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And us being the crew.

739
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Okay.

740
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So the songs were typical for our show.

741
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And well, they're the ones featured in this episode of the hit.

742
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
All right. So that's it.

743
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Thanks for the morning.

744
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Thanks for the morning.

745
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
From now on.

746
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Come on.

747
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Good morning.

748
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Good morning.

749
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Good evening.

750
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Good morning.

751
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I like my with the kids.

752
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah.

753
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I love that song.

754
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I love songs from that genre.

755
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm totally gay when it comes to that stuff.

756
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I can't have enough show tunes.

757
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And Dean Martin, hello, no.

758
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'll do that.

759
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm telling you.

760
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I love songs from that genre.

761
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm totally gay when it comes to that stuff.

762
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I can't have enough show tunes.

763
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And Dean Martin, hello, no.

764
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
All right.

765
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm telling you.

766
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Cool.

767
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Excellent.

768
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay.

769
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What do you got to say?

770
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I was going to say.

771
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It sounds like it's easy to talk with Viva Las Vegas.

772
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Now I get it.

773
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah.

774
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We took the whole crew to Las Vegas.

775
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And we married 10 of our listeners.

776
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm sure they'll talk about that one.

777
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We had there.

778
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yes.

779
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
We spent a week in Vegas for a special action.

780
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
We did with the listeners.

781
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
People got bright in and asked to be married by Adam in Las Vegas.

782
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So we went there for a week.

783
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
In the morning show from the rock, my club.

784
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It looks like a hotel.

785
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We had a blast.

786
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah, it was cool.

787
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Five couples.

788
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah.

789
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah.

790
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Five couples come here.

791
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And nice to know.

792
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
They're still married.

793
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah.

794
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
My record's still perfect.

795
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You know, how cool is it that we can do this, man?

796
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I mean, this is just so outrageous.

797
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm sitting here in a balcony in South Beach, Florida.

798
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There's a hit test that has been put together by young polette.

799
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
A guy I have never met in person.

800
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And he's reached out to the guys I used to work with on the radio.

801
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
They put that together.

802
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And now I'm sharing it with you.

803
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's just amazing.

804
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The first record.

805
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
The third record.

806
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yes.

807
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's Nutty.

808
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Fritado.

809
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I think so.

810
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Okay.

811
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Okay.

812
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Nelly Furtado.

813
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'll see if Mike Alexor or Adam tell the story behind that song.

814
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That is, indeed, one of the songs that we played over and over in the morning.

815
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And it's got a Dutch title as well.

816
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
We had a song which sounds like a test.

817
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It is that right.

818
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And it's called a form of main verse.

819
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And what does it mean?

820
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Eacculate on my breast.

821
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Okay.

822
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So this Nelly Furtado song.

823
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
What she sings sounds very much like the Dutch sentence.

824
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And Adam just explained what that means.

825
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So of course when you do a wacky morning show everybody.

826
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
You got to do a takeoff version of the song.

827
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Well, we did a spoof on this record.

828
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
What it was a hit.

829
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Because in Dutch foreside sounds just like Borsa which is tits.

830
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So, well, you know, we love tits.

831
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah.

832
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
We really big tits.

833
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh God, you know this.

834
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh man, that just got a lot of this.

835
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So that's it basically.

836
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
One thing young for the opportunity to do this.

837
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Thank you young.

838
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Thank you young.

839
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And thank you young for me as well.

840
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And we'll become famous now.

841
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We're sent to young.

842
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
On Danish source code.

843
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah.

844
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah, I reckon.

845
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah, perhaps more listeners than on the radio.

846
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I have to go in.

847
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I have to go in.

848
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I know.

849
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I've got a very, very, very, very touchy on.

850
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

851
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You're as famous.

852
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Well, you're as famous.

853
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Well, we're going to go in.

854
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Okay.

855
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
My arms.

856
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Oh, my arms.

857
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And I'm fine.

858
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Okay.

859
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
The crew from Korea and the crew.

860
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Alex Stevens.

861
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Mike Venge Stride.

862
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000

864
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Thanks a lot guys.

865
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It was fun and thanks for the tour of the studios.

866
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Hope to see you again soon.

867
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Well, I'm this wraps up the special edition of the hit test.

868

869
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000

Alright, thank you very much.

876
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yompolet always surprising me with something new

877
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and of course the crew.

878
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm longer better than my heel fainst than Alex on the stay.

879
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That was great guys.

880
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I really, really, really appreciate it.

881
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And I'm looking forward to seeing you guys again real soon.

882
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
We're doing a little reunion because we also went to a rack and broadcast

883
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
from Camp Smitty for, was it for a full week?

884
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And we left our transmitter behind.

885
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Transmida!

886
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The Marines needed a stand-in transmitter.

887
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And we also left the dish behind.

888
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So they could basically hear the hometown radio station

889
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
throughout Camp.

890
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And now that the Dutch officially left Iraq

891
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and took their place.

892
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Was it...

893
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I remember it was Italian Spaniards?

894
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, anyway, the Dutch are out

895
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and they're back home.

896
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And I guess they want to hand over the transmitter

897
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
officially and thank us for that.

898
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And then with one fell swoop,

899
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
we're going to hand it right back to them because

900
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
they're going to use it for their next mission,

901
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
which is Afghanistan.

902
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So, just goes to show.

903
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Great hit test.

904
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I really appreciate it.

905
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Alrighty, that was it.

906
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Another daily source code.

907
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I have no idea how this sounds.

908
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I have a feeling the microphone sounds pretty shitty.

909
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
But maybe it's just me shivering from the cold

910
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
but it's now gotten a little bit chilly

911
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
or it's 10 past 10 in the evening on Sunday night.

912
