00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Daily source code, Friday April 8th, 2005.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You're DJ!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Are you done?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right!

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Your DJ has own pages.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There's been the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You don't need us.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It can kill me.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I like to think I'm sighing into this jerk.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Fantastic kiss.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is the Daily source code for Friday.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh yeah.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, this is a test of the cast blaster.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're up to date at number four right now.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And a little bit late to unrecording the podcast today.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've been working with the developers on getting all this stuff working and rocking.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So yeah, I'm still, I figured out how to do the auto function.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, it's kind of interesting.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Which means it's taking care of all the levels for me.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And it's actually sounding pretty good.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me just lower the mic a little bit there.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we have a better mix.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let me see.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is this what we want?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, Matt.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is making my life a lot easier.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So it's April 8th, I thought, I hope I said 2005.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let me just demonstrate my jingles here.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hold on.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We should do it like this.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hold on.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There we go.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So I pressed the talk button right now.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wow, it actually works.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The software is actually taking care of the mixing for me.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What I've done is I have hooked up my regular microphone.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I believe it's the sound is pretty much where it should be right now.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've got a great story to tell about this.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So you know, I have the tablet, which I'm recording this on.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's the only PC I actually own and control.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The only other PC in the house is, well, not own, but controlled by Christina.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You know, you know how that goes, right?

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She basically doesn't want me messing around with her shit.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So on the laptop.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, my second one here.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There we go.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
On the laptop.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There is only a microphone in.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And yesterday a lot of people commented on the sound on the quality of the sound.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And I said, well, you know, the software doesn't sound too good because your microphone

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
sounds are muffled.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Again, I wasn't using my regular setup.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What I was using yesterday was an altec lancing, which I don't really think they're known

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
for, like, banging all of some quality.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's just one of those, like, you know, kind of like an airplane or helicopter pilot head

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
sets.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We got the headphones on and there's a little mic that sits in front of your mouth.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, that, of course, is the entire reason why it didn't sound as good.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Although I have to say, even for that microphone, it didn't sound too bad at all.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But I really do like the processing of my own mic.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Actually, I want to hang up there with me one second.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I just, what I'd like to do is put on different set of headphones.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've got the ear buds in here and it sounds like one of them is malfunctioning.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hold on.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I mean, just walk over to the other side of the studio.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So, here's the altec lancing.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hold on.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm just going to plug this in as a headset and see if that sounds any better for me.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hold on.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hope we don't get any feedback.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, yeah.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, this sounds much better.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, nice.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So, you can hear that now, my echo chamber is working.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've got the compression on the microphone.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm not wearing my glasses right now, so it's kind of hard to see.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If it's, is that working?

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
One, two, one, two.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Sounds pretty good.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So, on the laptop, you only have a microphone.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So, on the laptop, you only have a microphone.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So, on the laptop, you only have a microphone.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And on the laptop, you only have a microphone in.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I tried just putting my, the output of my mixer, which has all the processing of my microphone.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Just so I could use my current microphone.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And of course, these types of mics, the sure SMSM7 that I'm using,

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
doesn't have a, you know, won't output a signal that you can put into a, into a mic per say.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's all kind of mismatch between

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the prosumer gear that is windows and the professional stuff that, that is my, that is my studio here.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, I needed to come up with a way to weaken the signal coming out of the mixer to put it into,

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
what's it, what we call a line output.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, excuse me, I just ate dinner.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sound like mad.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm bloated.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A way to weaken that signal, so it wouldn't overdrive the mic input,

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
because basically a mic input is a very sensitive, you know,

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
a very sensitive input to take any kind of microphone and just amplify that.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So you can use it, which, of course, works great with the LTCH Lansing.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But when you, when you put a line signal into the mic jack, it completely overmodulates it.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And then you can, you can, you can turn down the recording to almost like just a,

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
it's open just a hair.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So it doesn't overmodulate, but then because you kind of like trying to squeeze all this sound,

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the input into this, into something it doesn't, you know,

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
it's the wrong stick in the wrong hole, basically, folks.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I needed to weaken that.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now, we went on vacation.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And while we were on vacation, my in-laws came to stay.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think I mentioned that.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They stayed here to take care of the animals, take care of the house.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And you got to know my father-in-law.

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
First of all, one of the most talented people I know, hands down,

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
not just as a musician, he can write entire scores for, you know,

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
24 piece orchestra, just in his head.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And he writes that down by hand.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I mean, that's an amazing talent.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I mean, that's, you know, that's virtuos, essentially.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He plays keyboard, saxophone, violin.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He has a perfect pitch.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's just an amazing musician.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But he can also, and Patricia has a lot of this talent.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He can make anything with his hands.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If he can think of it, he can see it, he can do it with his hands.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And this is just, it's, it's an amazing talent.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I, I joke about it all the time.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You give him some, like, gaffer tape and some toothpicks and he'll build you a house.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And so he's talking about this.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He said, you know, John, do you have any idea how I could fix this?

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He said, well, yeah, just have to build a little thing with some resistors.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And this and that and I, I don't have no fucking resistors.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Resistance, we don't need no stankin' resistors.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's old school technology.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And he went into the garage, and I was up here,

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
basically on Skype all day talking to Ron, talking to people,

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
doing my thing.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And he came back upstairs.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And he first brought me the prototype.

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And I've taken pictures of every single step of the way.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I've included links to this on, on the show notes for today.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And he built this box, which, well, so he's, this is the great thing.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I didn't have resistors.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And you know, I said, so it comes back from the garage.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He says, hey, I found, like, a two broken dimmers, light switch dimmers,

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and found some other gear, and I pulled that out.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And so essentially, he made this little box,

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and one side, a little mini jack.

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I plug in my, my, the output from the mixer,

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and then a jack on the other side.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And that goes into the mic in of my laptop.

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And there's two, uh, saw it off,

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
shaving down, um, um,

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
um, potential meters.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So basically the knob that you used to dim the lighting.

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And you can completely, um, regulate the output from the mixer

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
down to an acceptable signal from the microphone.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And it's a beautiful little metal box.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And these two, um, two things,

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
they can actually, I'll twist one of them here for you.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let me see, because it's stereo.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's why he built one.

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I'm turning down the one,

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and I can turn it up a little bit.

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And so you can't, yeah, well, that's, that's 20.

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There you go.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's probably why that dimmer was in the garage.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's broken.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Uh, so it works.

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It works.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, can you perfectly?

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I couldn't be happier.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Whenever I turn up my, uh, my microphone gain,

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
all the lights in, uh, in Gilford, uh, dim.

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So let me give you a quick walk through, um,

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
uh, of a couple of, uh, a couple of features here.

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Uh, by the way, I saw some, some comments.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Could I put up that screen shot?

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll just like basically did the,

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I love that cool little sniping tool.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can use on, um, on the Windows tablet.

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I saw comments somewhere.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It was on podcast.com, which is, you know,

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Dave Winner's new place where he's tracking all the technology,

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
uh, all the podcasting tools and services,

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
which is actually a pretty good resource.

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Good comparison chart there.

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I do agree with a lot of what Dave is saying is that,

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you know, you don't really need to go reinvent the wheel

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and a lot of this stuff.

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Um, and it's actually not that hard to come up with,

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you know, things that'll work.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think it's all about interfaces.

203
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You know, that's, to record a signal and play it back

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and create an MP3 file and do the right compression.

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not going to trivialize it, but it can be done.

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You know, there's, there's enough knowledge out there

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that you could put that together.

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But then you really create the interface that works for a podcast.

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So that's what I think is, is going to be important.

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I took a little bit of my radio background

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and injected that into, uh, into the development group.

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Um, and it came out with some, some really, uh,

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
yeah, it was something really cool.

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So actually, me, uh, so if I right click on one of my, uh,

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
where my cartridge, uh, buttons here, uh, wait a minute, he had,

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
ah, there were all these great sound effects that,

217
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that is now come with a program that, of course,

218
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I've immediately lost.

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let me see. Oh, now I have to go do the windows trip,

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
ladies and gentlemen, hold on.

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So I have to go to, what is it?

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I guess I go to my computer, right?

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
My computer shared documents.

224
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is that where I find it?

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, not shared documents, hold on.

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Local disk. Okay, uh, program files.

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, there we go.

228
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now we have to find, was it cast blaster?

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ah, okay. There we go. Oh, here they are.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Here's the, here's the stuff.

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So you can load up these files.

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And of course, I still have the, yep, got that.

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, that's lined up for, uh, for easy, I'll get real tight

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
or that pretty soon.

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And, um, I don't have any songs, uh,

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
well, I guess I could load up a song for you.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's, uh, I got some promos that I wanted to run by.

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And this is going to be another reasonably short show.

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Um, just because I didn't have, uh, I'll be honest with you.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I really haven't had enough time to, to do all the prep today

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
that I normally would.

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I definitely wanted to get, uh, a different sounding version

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
out of, uh, of the cast blaster.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So I'm just going to play a couple of these promos.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, now this promo has to be great because we're going to

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
sit it out to Adam Curry.

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Who's Adam Curry?

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Adam Curry.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Do you know who Adam Curry is?

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, that's right. That's the guy that does love line, right?

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's Adam Corolla.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Adam Curry from MTV's, like the God of podcasting.

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay, I haven't heard of him.

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay, whatever. Look, just let me lead the promo.

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You, you just kind of play along, all right?

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sounds good.

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, by the way, I can now stop anything that's playing.

260
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And when I started again, it starts in exactly the same spot,

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
something that we changed from the functionality from yesterday.

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know if it just heard a drop out on that.

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know if that's the file or if that's, uh,

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the playback or what it is, but we'll continue with the promo.

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay, here we go.

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And we're rolling.

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey, Adam, this is Don.

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And this is Jared Ardman.

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And it's a major honor to have our promo be played on your podcast.

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Uh, yeah, hey, we wanted you and your listeners to know about our new podcast.

271
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's called DVD Weekly.

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And each week my brother Jared and I are going to cover the newest DVD releases

273
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
as well as recently released title.

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And we do it all in our special kind of way.

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And, you know, we're not going to be as good as Adam was on MTV.

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But we think you'll still get a kick out of what we do.

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's right.

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So join us on DVD Weekly today.

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You can find the link on the directory at digitalpodcast.com.

280
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Just look under movies and entertainment.

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Dude, what the hell was that?

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
All of a sudden you're like all up into Adam Curry.

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You didn't even know he was a couple seconds ago.

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you kidding, man?

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's Adam Curry.

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
MTV.

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Come on, man.

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The god of podcast.

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I just told you that a couple of, uh, good Lord.

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Wait, wait, wait guys.

291
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So there's another promo that came in that goes along perfectly with that one.

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
How to pimp your show.

294
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Step one massage the egos of fellow podcasters.

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Before the daily source code.

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was a complete wreck though.

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The daily source code brought happiness and joy back to my life.

298
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I listen to the daily source code every day.

299
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Step two.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Pimp your own pod show by praising their show.

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I tried to model my show.

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
W.

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
W.

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm a great penguin.

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That com.

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
After the daily source code.

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Without the daily source code.

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
My show.

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
W. W.

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That.

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm a great penguin.

312
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That com.

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Would not even exist.

314
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The show.

315
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
W. W.

316
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That. I'm a great penguin.

317
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That com.

318
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, is it all to you?

319
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The daily source code.

320
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That is how to pimp your own pod show.

321
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
W. W. That.

322
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm a great penguin.

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That com.

324
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I think we've actually played a promo for them before.

325
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've talked about them.

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So again, I'm not sure if the dropouts are coming from the playback or if they're coming

327
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
from the cast blaster itself.

328
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's something I've got to look into.

329
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't think anything changed on that.

330
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So it's a little difficult to tell.

331
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay.

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Notice something here.

333
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And this is, I guess, another beta cast of the cast blaster software.

334
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And we're going to get some betas out to people pretty soon.

335
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Trust me on that.

336
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I have four slots for playing.

337
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
For playing audio files.

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That include.

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It includes a track bar.

340
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So the jingles are just a single button.

341
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's the blank thing.

342
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Or the.

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is.

344
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is really fun to do this with the pen.

345
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You know, it's it's a very interactive way of doing it.

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So I don't have enough to.

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I guess I would need a way to add more more tunes to it.

348
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because if you have a relatively long podcast and you have a lot of stuff, then four is not going to cut it.

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So let me.

350
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You know what I'm going to do?

351
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's do something really tricky.

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm going to open and load up a new file.

353
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to.

354
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Draw it from or this is going to be fun folks.

355
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let me go.

356
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm going to try and get something off of my.

357
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Macintosh.

358
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So wait to hear that.

359
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's the.

360
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's my wonderful little box.

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay.

362
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So I have it loaded as a network.

363
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Place.

364
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I think.

365
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let me see open.

366
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There we go.

367
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Works.

368
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

369
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Beautiful.

370
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Now I'm in my.

371
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now I'm on my Macintosh.

372
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And.

373
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, here's something we can do.

374
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, the lot of found this.

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is.

376
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh.

377
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Man.

378
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is great.

379
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm.

380
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't think I can play the whole thing.

381
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
When we're in Miami.

382
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Did you hear that?

383
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let me just adjust this.

384
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is.

385
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay.

386
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We need to fix that.

387
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That one little different.

388
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We got to fix the light dimmer for the audio.

389
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
One of Matthew Bischoff's buddies.

390
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Now, of course, some bogey on what his name was.

391
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The hell was his name?

392
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hold on.

393
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let me see if I can.

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let me.

395
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
All right.

396
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And now we're going to do something cool.

397
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Check this out.

398
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Me a fire up Skype for a second here.

399
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Okay.

400
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Skype is firing up.

401
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If Christina's online downstairs, and I'll just call her and ask her what his name is,

402
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
because I've completely forgotten.

403
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Let me see.

404
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Wait.

405
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't tell me she's not online.

406
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Skype always takes a couple of seconds to find everybody.

407
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There we go.

408
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's much better.

409
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There she is.

410
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay.

411
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Oops.

412
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There we go.

413
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let's call her.

414
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay.

415
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Check that out.

416
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It works.

417
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay.

418
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Of course Patricia's going to answer now.

419
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Watch.

420
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That'll be funny.

421
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Hello.

422
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Shvarky.

423
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah.

424
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Hey, I'm recording my show.

425
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay.

426
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hey, let me ask you a question.

427
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What was the name of the guy who did that interview with you?

428
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The podcast?

429
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Robby.

430
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Robby.

431
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What's his last name?

432
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Trinchiny.

433
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Trinchiny.

434
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay.

435
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Is okay if I play a part on the daily source code?

436
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Sure.

437
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Go for it.

438
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay.

439
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hold on a second.

440
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Actually.

441
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If I play this, maybe you can hear it.

442
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Hold on.

443
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Listen.

444
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Hold on.

445
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Giving you an interview.

446
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The first time ever.

447
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey, everybody.

448
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The strawberry jersey.

449
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What?

450
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He took a lot.

451
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Can you hear that Christina?

452
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah.

453
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay.

454
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So you want to set it up.

455
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You want to tell me what happened.

456
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What happened to Miami?

457
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
How did it come about that he did this interview with you?

458
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He kept Skype me the whole time.

459
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I was on the internet and it kept really annoying me because I had so in your laptop.

460
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And over time I heard, wouldn't it?

461
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He was totally out of control on the Skype.

462
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And he was annoying Ron as well apparently.

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah.

464
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So I decided to give him a piece of my mind and tell him to just fuck off.

465
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, no.

466
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Mind your language, dear.

467
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
He's annoying.

469
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And then all of a sudden I felt bad for him.

470
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And I said, well, if you leave everyone alone, I'll give you an interview.

471
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And he said, oh, okay.

472
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And he didn't really keep his word.

473
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay.

474
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hold on.

475
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Let's play another piece of this for a second.

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Clive.

477
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Giving you an interview.

478
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The first time ever interview.

479
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Christina Curry.

480
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

481
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's right.

482
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Adam Curry's daughter.

483
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Welcome to the show.

484
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Hi.

485
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Hi.

486
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh, man. The sound quality sucks.

487
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's because Mom was like vacuuming in the background.

488
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I hate it when she does that.

489
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah.

490
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I said, mom, and she's like, oh, it doesn't matter.

491
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You can't hear it.

492
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And we obviously can.

493
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Of course, the way around that is maybe you or I could have done some of the vacuuming.

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay.

495
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's listen to a little more.

496
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Hold on.

497
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So um, Christina will jump right into it.

498
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Um, what do you think about your dad and podcasting?

499
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I mean, does it judge the effect you or are you just okay with it?

500
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Or do you not like it?

501
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I love it.

502
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I love it.

503
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I love how my dad's just like created this thing out of nothing.

504
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And everyone's going for it.

505
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I love the idea.

506
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And hopefully I'm going to start podcast one day when I have something to say.

507
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I was born.

508
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And it's really clear.

509
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What the hell was that?

510
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That would be you calling me.

511
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh.

512
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay.

513
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
For you.

514
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay.

515
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We should play the part when I told him to not get his panties in a gun.

516
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Do you know where it is?

517
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Was it the beginning?

518
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's like in the middle.

519
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

520
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hold on.

521
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Let me drag this over in the middle.

522
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll play it.

523
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think that it should be something that we should watch.

524
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And if needed, we could always go in and bash people's hands.

525
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Is it before after that?

526
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
This is it.

527
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah.

528
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay.

529
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think you shouldn't get your panties in a bunch of better.

530
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I mean, people were always because of me saying,

531
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, but you're so scared.

532
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I said, don't get your panties in a bunch of pieces.

533
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, okay.

534
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Just show, you know, podcasting.

535
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, that's so funny.

536
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's great.

537
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's great.

538
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay.

539
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
All right.

540
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So, did he put that interview up anywhere?

541
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Is it an official podcast somewhere?

542
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No.

543
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But I did get an email from one of his little geek friends saying,

544
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
how funny it was.

545
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah.

546
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well, how did he hear it then?

547
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So, it has he posted it?

548
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Is there a URL?

549
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
We can point because it's like 30 minutes or something, right?

550
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

551
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't know where it is.

552
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Did you check his website?

553
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No.

554
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
No.

555
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why don't you check it for me?

556
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And then when I post the show, I'll put it in the show notes.

557
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay.

558
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Okay.

559
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Hey, this worked.

560
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You can hear it.

561
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

562
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You can hear everything.

563
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's great.

564
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I mean, I'm recording.

565
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It works.

566
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm so happy.

567
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's what I'm doing up here all day, dear.

568
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Wait.

569
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm on his website.

570
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Hold on.

571
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's see if he posted it.

572
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No, he didn't.

573
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay.

574
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, you know what?

575
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Send him an email and ask him if I can put it up on my server.

576
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And I'll put a link to it.

577
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay.

578
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
All right.

579
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Which, of course, means he'll start emailing you a thousand times, right?

580
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah.

581
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Okay.

582
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
All right, baby.

583
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
All right.

584
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Thank you very much.

585
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
All right.

586
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Bye.

587
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Love you.

588
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
All right.

589
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There you have it.

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The first test with Skype.

591
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And you'll notice that not only were you able to hear her as I recorded Christina,

592
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but she was also able to hear what I was sending back to her.

593
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That is cool.

594
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What's happening at Adam and the Daily Source Code listeners.

595
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This is Todd Collins from the podcast.

596
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What's really going on?

597
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes.

598
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I am a Daily Source Code listener and a Mac user.

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But I've got a unique show for you right now.

600
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's from Beatmar recordings.

601
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Beatmar recordings is a small indie urban label.

602
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And it's a show about behind the scenes and a look at what goes on in the world of recording,

603
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
recording business as well as the tech side of the productions.

604
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So come join us.

605
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We'll talk about sports, snicker culture, upcoming artists and releases.

606
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But most of all, content from you.

607
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We're going to take questions, comments, feedback, all of that in email form, or in MP3 form.

608
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
To www.rgeopodcast at gmail.com.

609
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You can also visit the what's really going on podcast at www.lipsen.com.

610
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's www.libs-y-n.com.

611
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Or you can subscribe to the RSS feed at www.lipsen.com slash RSS.

612
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Hope to hear from you soon.

613
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And that's what's really going on.

614
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Now back to you Adam Curry and the Daily Source Code.

615
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
All right.

616
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So I am now convinced that it's something with the program that is tripping over on that.

617
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I don't know why it's doing that.

618
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Probably what I should have done this being Windows.

619
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I probably should have rebooted before recording anything.

620
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't think anything changed with the playback.

621
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I wasn't seeing that behavior yesterday.

622
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So that's something we'll have to work on.

623
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So you don't have to email me that there were stuff dropping out because clearly I figured that went out.

624
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Cool.

625
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Let's see.

626
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Twenty-two minutes.

627
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You know, I've been upstairs almost all day.

628
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's 9.15.

629
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So I am going to cut it reasonably short.

630
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Last night the in-laws are here.

631
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And particularly since John was so incredibly nice to make this sound dimmer for me.

632
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Which I think we should put into production.

633
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
This is actually I told him what I wanted next.

634
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's a little box that you remember.

635
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I tried to combine my microphone with the iPod and have that record onto the iRiverb.

636
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And I got the huge impedance differences.

637
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And then whenever the iPod would shut off and all of a sudden everyone's ears would blow out.

638
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So he's got an idea for a little box to fix that as well.

639
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So look out.

640
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We may put some of that stuff into production in one of these days.

641
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Hey, Adam, of course you heard of the sound of the day.

642
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Well, I'm here to bring you the smell of the day.

643
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Just the latest installment of worldwide web zaniness and here you go coming right up.

644
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The smell of the day.

645
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And then we get all that with the smell of the day brought to you by the daily dribble at www.dali dribble.net.

646
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Okay, so cut out a couple times there as well.

647
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, now let's try something because I did ask something to be changed in the players.

648
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Essentially, before if you wanted to stop something, you know, to comment on it, it would rewind all the way.

649
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We've now made it so that a right mouse click or on the pen, which means holding down a little button and tapping.

650
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You can rewind it manually.

651
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Maybe that's something to do with the way the playback was changed.

652
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So bear with me as we beta test this.

653
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So I'm going to load the exact same promo.

654
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Hold on, I'll load that into one of the jingle cartridges.

655
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's the, that's the ones that you really aren't supposed to be able to rewind.

656
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Although I just found out you can.

657
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Let me see if it has the same cutouts there.

658
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Hold on, which one was it?

659
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Smell of the day.

660
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay, so we heard smell of the day cut out.

661
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's play it again and see if it doesn't cut out.

662
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Cut out when it's in a different player.

663
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Hey, Adam, of course you heard of the sound of the day.

664
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Well, I'm here to bring you the smell of the day.

665
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Just the latest installment of worldwide web zaniness, and here you go, come and write up the smell of the day.

666
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh, there you go.

667
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That was the smell of the day brought to you by the daily dribble at www.dali dribble.net.

668
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Okay.

669
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That settles it.

670
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We figured it out.

671
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This is what beta testing is all about folks.

672
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We figured out that something on the players, the ones that have the status bar,

673
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
is making the audio drop out and skip intermittently.

674
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay.

675
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Wow.

676
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Okay, I think I've had enough beta testing for one day if you don't mind.

677
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And it's time for me to go have some coffee with the in-laws.

678
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So, special thanks to the development team of cast blaster.

679
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Really enjoying the work.

680
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We're going to try and fix some of the little buggies and gotchas there.

681
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So, maybe I'll even do something over the weekend.

682
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Now that Skype is working so great, I can finally record perfectly with Kenster J for MTV Chronicles.

683
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Just gotta make the player stuff.

684
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Gotta fix that.

685
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm sure that I've already got a buddy there in Holland going.

686
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Damn, I know exactly what's wrong.

687
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm probably fixing it already.

688
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
All right.

689
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Feedback.

690
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000

this program, where you can subscribe to the podcast feed and find the archives.

694
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Hope you have yourselves a great Friday.

695
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Take care everybody.

696
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'll catch you over the weekend. Bye-bye.
