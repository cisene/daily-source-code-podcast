1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
don't just share a charlie one nine or nine or

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
nine or

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that would

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the two podfathers sitting next to each other

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
oh and their shaking hands right now

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to hear the crowd is very very happy about that

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
strapped to my ass

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
than the next generation radio content in my ears

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we don't need us thinking

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
crazy

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I like to think I'm

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
flying into this journey

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
fantastic

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
hey everybody how you doing

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
coming to you from my hotel room

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
this is

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
daily source code episode

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
one hundred and ninety nine

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and that can't be a coincidence

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
my friends

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
no no no no no I've really

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I've been in my hotel room

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
what time is it now

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
it's ten past eight

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I left the conference

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
of course I'm talking about

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
nomdex

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I should probably

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
restate for

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
not everyone knows exactly

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
what's going on if you just

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
tuning into the daily source code

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but there's a conference

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in progress right now in Seattle

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
which is

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
nomdex five

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which is organized by Chris

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Perillo and Ponzi

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and there's four hundred

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
attendees here and speakers

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and there's some really

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
fascinating beautiful stuff

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
happening

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
tomorrow I have an interesting

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
task

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm doing a keynote speech

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and when Chris asked me if I wanted to

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
the keynote for nomdex I immediately said

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
yeah of course I do

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I would have thought that

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the keynote speech is the first

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
speech of a conference

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
but in this case it's

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the last speech

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and Dave Weinner actually did the

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
keynote speech

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
this morning which was the first

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
speech

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and I've never done one at the end

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
of a conference

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but now everything is starting to unfold

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
for me and I'm starting to understand

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
what my role is and what I'm

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
supposed to be saying tomorrow

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and I did tell everyone hey

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't know what I'm going to talk about yet

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
because I want to attend the conference

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and I have figured it out

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
which of course makes this daily source code

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
rather difficult

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't want to

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
you have to understand the situation

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
so

78
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I've got a really nice room

79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
as a great hotel

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
it's beautiful

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
it's not large but it has everything

82
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
it's got a table near the window

83
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and I'm overload

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm looking out into the street

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
so I'm not looking towards the water

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
side

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but that's okay

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm not looking outside much

89
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and there's a table there

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
with a lamp

91
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and I've got my

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
my Mac

93
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've got my Craplet

94
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
which I'm actually recording on

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and cast Blaster

96
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
which I think

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
tomorrow we're going to open up

98
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
a time limited beta

99
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
or something like that

100
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I haven't really been focusing too much on it

101
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
so I'm just kind of letting that go

102
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
it's course

103
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but that's something to hear

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
you know there

105
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
although I am really excited about it

106
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and I've got papers all over the place

107
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've been writing down notes

108
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I was actually just

109
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
watching the

110
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
MSN Channel 9

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll just call it a podcast

112
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it's video

113
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
but I'm going to call it a podcast

114
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Robert Scobel did

115
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
basically a

116
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
reiteration of what Dean told us today

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
what Microsoft is doing

118
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
what he told us at the conference on stage

119
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
with Microsoft is doing with RSS

120
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and that moment stuff

121
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
really just started to click together

122
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and I got all kinds of

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
just all made sense

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
it really did

125
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
so I'm very excited about

126
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
now preparing for my speech for tomorrow

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
which I'm not sure what time it is actually

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
well I don't really look it up

129
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
it's at the end of the day

130
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and so I'm probably going to just stay in

131
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and order some room service

132
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and just kind of vibe on through it

133
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and I'm really motivated

134
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
really excited

135
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
because this is just

136
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
just hit me

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and let me see

138
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I had a couple notes

139
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want to talk about for this

140
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
podcast

141
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I want to kind of remove the

142
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
earbuds for a second

143
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
let me see

144
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
see this is all the stuff I want to

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
talk about tomorrow

146
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
oh

147
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you something

148
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I did learn something

149
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I learned a little bit more about

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
techno-radi today

151
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I've never really paid much attention

152
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to techno-radi

153
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm not quite sure why

154
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but I'll figure that out eventually

155
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but I really

156
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I was just interested to see

157
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
how we were doing

158
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
what were the messages that we were sending out

159
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
what was the main topic

160
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
what is really going out

161
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
into the world

162
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
from these 400 people

163
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and just typed in

164
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Nomdex

165
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and techno-radi

166
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and I got like a lot of blog posts

167
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and lots of audio and video

168
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and pictures

169
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and

170
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
eloquent descriptions of what's going on

171
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
very exciting

172
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we're doing a great job

173
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
certainly doing a great job

174
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and so now I hope to be able to kind of wrap it all up tomorrow

175
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
so that we have a mission

176
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and we can go and go

177
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
go forth and do something with all this energy

178
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that has just been

179
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
has descended upon

180
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Seattle

181
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
which I'm starting to understand a little bit better actually

182
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I've been here several times

183
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
on business to Microsoft

184
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and I understand overnight

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and I think

186
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm on, I was at 4th Avenue

187
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and like Spring Street or something

188
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and so I've been able to walk around a little bit

189
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and have, yeah, it's very nice

190
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
there's some beautiful parts of Seattle

191
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm really enjoying

192
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it's great to be in this city

193
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
for a particularly for this event

194
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I think that's it really

195
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't want to, you know, use it too much here

196
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
time this is actually very short

197
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
six minutes

198
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but

199
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
most of the attendees

200
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
for nomdex

201
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
probably

202
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
are going to

203
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
or maybe

204
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
but you're probably hopefully

205
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you're hearing this

206
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
because this is as much for

207
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the nomdex

208
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
participants

209
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
as for

210
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
regular source code listeners

211
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
but of course I'm hoping that

212
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
when everyone's back from the

213
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think it's the Yahoo party tonight

214
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
that

215
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
that everyone just has a quick listen to

216
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
the source code

217
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and that are really excited

218
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
about tomorrow

219
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
it's going to be lots of great

220
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
panels

221
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and discussions

222
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and

223
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it is a kind of a good flow

224
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
of going in and out

225
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you know, you can walk into a

226
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
it's a kind of basically

227
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
it's one big room

228
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but there's lots of space to kind of talk

229
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and there are rooms

230
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
where people can set up

231
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and can record stuff

232
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and everyone's recording a podcast

233
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that's really amazing

234
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I just wish I had more time to talk

235
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to everybody

236
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
because

237
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I actually

238
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
pretty much know

239
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
everyone who's here

240
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
it's

241
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I know that I've

242
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
exchanged email

243
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
with just what everyone

244
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
has come up to me and people come up

245
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and say, you know,

246
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
hey, how's Patricia?

247
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
How's Christina?

248
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How's the dogs?

249
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How's this?

250
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And, you know, they know about my life

251
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and it's really

252
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it's a great experience

253
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and I also know

254
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
often a lot about their lives

255
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, I think that's all I had

256
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
on my list

257
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
because I'm going to move this all over

258
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
to the speech

259
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
for tomorrow

260
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and of course

261
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that was what I started

262
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
off with

263
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
this is episode

264
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
number 199

265
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
something really just feels good

266
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
about tomorrow

267
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
because of course

268
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll be recording my

269
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
nomdex

270
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
keynote

271
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
as

272
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
a podcast

273
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
it will be

274
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
daily source code

275
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
number 200

276
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
so that's just good karma

277
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'd say

278
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
wouldn't you?

279
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okidoki

280
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
