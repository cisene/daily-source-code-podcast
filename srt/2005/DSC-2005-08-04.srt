1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 220.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A voice 65 million years in the making.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm a mysterious.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm like a horse.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Rated R17 not admitted without parent.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, we prepared to move on to the ceremony.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Prepare.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Nothing could ever prepare you for what awaits you at the ceremony.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Something remarkable is happening here.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who managed what you can hear since radio is invented.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No one's going to stop you down in FCC to stick a kick at the revolutions.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is great St. Clair from cruise box.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're listening to Adam Curry.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
On the daily source gun.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Kick it.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I like to think I'm flying.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How about that opening, huh?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's July 4, 2005.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I love it.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Two minutes of doing nothing.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Just watching Megaseg roll on my eye.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Although I have to be honest and admit that it crashed.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I just upon opening the rock money enough.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So this is actually the restart of data source code episode

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So 220 for August 5, 2005.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry, August 4, 2005.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And you know what tomorrow is August 5.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's actually, I think the fifth is our wedding anniversary.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We can never get it right.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We both keep forgetting it.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Look at our wedding certificate to see what year it was.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
August 5, that's right.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
1988?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Seems like a long time ago.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then again, it seems only like yesterday.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All right, I'm the show today.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We've got a bit of the daily download I want to play for you.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Got an excellent, excellent number of little promos and bits.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And of course, some pod save music.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And of course, a mashover before you.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want to talk about my GPS mania.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
See, tomorrow, of course, we're going on vacation.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I've spent quite a bit of time booking that over the past 48 hours.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'd love to spew some about credit card companies.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How they operate.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And the weather is kind of, you know, it's kind of mellow today.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Maybe 21, 22 degrees centigrade.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So it's, it's not chilly, but the consensus is no sunshine.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Just on the edge.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But it's been a good day to sit inside and do all kinds of admin.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And sit on the phone with credit card companies.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All right, I've been playing a lot of DJ earworm mashups lately.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Today, something different to eight of sent it to me, eight of from mashuptown.com.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This one's titled We Belong Together, Time After Time.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And it's done by Arty Fuffkin.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I can only imagine that Arty Fuffkin might be a duck, but I'm going to do that in a minute.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's Mariah Carey and see you all.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you still.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I should have held on time.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I never should have let you go.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I was foolish.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I would like to myself.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I couldn't rather know whatever being without your love.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Never imagined I'd be sitting there by myself.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because I didn't know you, because I didn't know me.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But if I knew everything, I didn't want to be with you.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So please, I'm glad I feel it's not that I don't feel it.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, you touch and kiss your lips, cos I don't have a choice.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
All I wouldn't get an abulant, I'm not the same right here.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Cos we make no love, you can love, you will find this.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I love the time.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I love the time.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you love, you can't love, can you will find this.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I love the time.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I love the time.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you fall, I will keep in love.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I've been tired of my own

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've been all alone

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I've been all alone

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I've been all alone

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I've been all alone

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've been all alone

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've been all alone

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've been all alone

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I've been all alone

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've been all alone

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I've been all alone

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've been all alone

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've been all alone

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've been all alone

109
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I've been all alone

110
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
I've been all alone

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've been all alone

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've been all alone

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I've been all alone

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've been all alone

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've been all alone

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've been all alone

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've been all alone

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've been all alone

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I've been all alone

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I've been all alone

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I've been all alone

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've been all alone

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I've been all alone

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
I've been all alone

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
I've been all alone

126
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:36,800
You know, they would make total sense with a do something together.

127
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,800
A great idea, Cindy Lauberon, where I carry.

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
And like that.

129
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Very cool.

130
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Artie Fuffkin, brought to you by mashuptown.com.

131
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Yeah, mashup for today for this Thursday, the fourth of August.

132
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
We belong together time after time.

133
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Okay, first I want to talk about my carpal tunnel syndrome.

134
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You know, keep talking about my shoulder and my hand.

135
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
But now I'm 99.9% convinced.

136
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,800
And you know, some doctors have told me that I basically have carpal tunnel syndrome.

137
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
And it's from yanking my yolk.

138
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,800
And that was from the weakstrate of anxiety training for my fixed wing pilot's license.

139
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
And I know that after this weekend, I flew for a couple hours on Saturday.

140
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Actually for quite a while, you know, like maybe four or five hours.

141
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
And yep, most definitely.

142
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
That's what it's from.

143
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
So, and it seems like someday it seems better than others.

144
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm not sure if I'm just getting more used to this kind of prickly, almost falling asleep like feeling in my left hand.

145
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I can use everything fine.

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,800
I just don't have quite all the sensation in my index finger and thumb.

147
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,800
You know, so I can't really, you know, I have enough power in it.

148
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
But I can't really feel like if I'm grasping something properly.

149
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
It's, it's actually pretty fun.

150
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Of is what it is.

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
But I guess I'm just going to take it easy for the next two weeks.

152
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
I don't know where you're ganking and see if it gets better.

153
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,800
There's a lot of different ways you can get rid of carpal tunnel syndrome.

154
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,800
But the best way, of course, is to give your is to give the problem area rest.

155
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
So, no more you're ganking.

156
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:29,800
It's been most of the day trying to actually I booked tickets yesterday for the New York leg of our trip with Virgin.

157
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,800
I had a whole bunch of miles, which I wanted to cash in for Christina and so we can all fly up or deck.

158
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,800
And, you know, so we can have a real experience.

159
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,800
And I booked the tickets and, you know, I have credit cards that go to Banking United States.

160
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Man, you get red flagged on everything.

161
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,800
And then, you know, the total amount was over whatever limit had somehow magically been set.

162
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,800
And what could be spent per day anywhere abroad, since I'm ordering them in the United Kingdom.

163
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
So I had to split it up amongst two different cards.

164
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
And then, you know, so one card would be blocked and then I cleared that up.

165
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,800
And then, went back to the airline and then they split it up.

166
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
And just because of the, the weird nature of, do you hear this and say, oh, come on.

167
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Just because of the weird nature of the purchase, all of a sudden in the United Kingdom,

168
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
they blocked the other cards.

169
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
It's just been around about everyone's been really helpful.

170
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
But, you know, it's all for your protection, sir.

171
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
You do understand this.

172
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Like, fuck, no, it's for your protection.

173
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Because, you know, the credit card companies guarantee the purchases.

174
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,800
It's certainly very obvious that US cards seem to be much more prone to fraud detection,

175
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
whether it's real or not.

176
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,800
But flags do seem to go off a lot more sooner than any of the European credit cards I have.

177
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
And you think that it's kind of like, you know, it would be the same everywhere,

178
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
but there's a few mungus difference.

179
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,800
And I can order just, oh, about anything on my European, my European credit cards.

180
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
And there's no problem at all.

181
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
And there's no real maximums.

182
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
And I don't know.

183
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,800
It's, uh, I guess there's just that much more fraud going on in the States,

184
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
and then you got to wonder why.

185
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
You know, why is there a difference?

186
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Um, so just before I started the show,

187
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
my mother-in-law came running in big problem, big issue,

188
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,800
because one of the pieces of wood that we got yesterday for the table that my father-in-law

189
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
was going to build for me was missing when they delivered it today.

190
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Oh, by the way, here's a joke, not to try in the United Kingdom.

191
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Oh, uh, we, you know, we got all these huge pieces of 18 millimeter.

192
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Uh, what is it?

193
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Mf, whatever would, uh, Mf, I wanted to Mfc, but Mfp, Mfd, whatever.

194
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Um, and we got them all saw it all the right pieces.

195
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
You know, I was supervising it there.

196
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Myself the whole time to make sure we got everything right.

197
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Um, and then I went, you know, it was just one of the,

198
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,800
basically the backboard of this whole table that my father-in-law is building me,

199
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
so that I can have my whole studio set up at the right height.

200
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
I don't have to bend over to get to the laptop and the mixer.

201
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Um, and I like working standing up.

202
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Um, so they, it was too big the backboard to put into the car,

203
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,800
so we had a delivered, which was 27 and a half pounds extra.

204
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
That's like, you know, 50 bucks to deliver it.

205
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
And I, of course, said, wow, do I get a blowjob with that?

206
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
And I got the blanket stare.

207
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
And like, no response whatsoever.

208
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
And I guess the guy didn't appreciate the joke.

209
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Anyway, so they apparently misdelivered one piece.

210
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,800
So I have to go running after that before we leave tomorrow somehow.

211
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Um, but he's busy.

212
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
He's in the garage.

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
He's starting to build it.

214
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
And the only bummer is that I'm not here really to document the process,

215
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
which sucks.

216
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
You know, I've got the plans.

217
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
I've got his blueprint.

218
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,800
I've got, uh, I took pictures in the store when we, um, bought the pieces.

219
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
And now I guess I'll get a couple pictures before we leave.

220
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
I think he's been putting some things together.

221
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
But this is going to be awesome.

222
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,800
And it's so cool to have someone, you know, just offered to do that.

223
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
So I'm, um, I'm, um, really flattered.

224
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
It's, uh, it's awesome.

225
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
It, it is awesome.

226
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
So can't wait.

227
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
What it's going to be like in two weeks when we come back.

228
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Because tomorrow is our lead for vacation day.

229
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
And I've been talking a lot about the pod safe music network.

230
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
And, um, this, of course, is the place where artists, listeners,

231
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,800
and podcasters come together where we're really building the promotional vehicle

232
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
around this concept of pod safe music.

233
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
So the podcasters can have a place to find the music to play.

234
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
And, um, and report back on it.

235
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
So we know who's getting a lot of pod play.

236
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
And, you know, listeners tuning to that.

237
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
And that's how you discover new music.

238
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
It's basically one big discovery engine.

239
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,800
So that's, uh, been basically been built by, uh, three people, uh,

240
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,800
CC Chapman, uh, Chris Rockwell from the Daily Download,

241
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
and CC from the accident hash podcast.

242
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,800
And then, uh, two from, uh, the super super freaking action show.

243
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Got that.

244
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm just going to kill me now.

245
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
That's okay.

246
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Because it's going to get mentioned again here.

247
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Yesterday, I was listening to, uh, Chris Rockwell,

248
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
the Daily Download.

249
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Now, you probably know him as the poop guy.

250
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Uh, but, uh, to me as a guy.

251
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,800
This is, this is just a fantastic podcast.

252
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
The whole concept is, you know, this, it's a,

253
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
pooping is a guy thing.

254
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Let's be honest about it.

255
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,800
So he started talking about, um, about the pod safe music network

256
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
and about Sue in, in particular.

257
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Now, if you grow stout about poop, don't listen to this piece.

258
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Uh, I think it's hilarious.

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
First, I wanted to think somebody, you know,

260
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,800
CC Chapman and I have been getting a lot of credit for the pod safe music network.

261
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
But one of the people that made it happen always seems to be left out.

262
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
And that's Sue from the extra super action show.

263
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
There you go.

264
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
She's really, I almost had an extra super action show.

265
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,800
So, so Chris clearly, um, uh, has tagged onto the right thing

266
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
because it just true Sue doesn't get enough of the credit in the mention.

267
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
She's also not, well, that's just not Sue.

268
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,800
So, uh, here come her, here come her props.

269
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Or should I say plops?

270
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
One of the big stars of the PMN.

271
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
If it wasn't for Sue's design and willingness to make

272
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
shit happen super quick, there would be no PMN.

273
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
So, today I thought I would dedicate my poop to Sue.

274
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
So I'm going to sit down here.

275
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,800
And while I push, I'm going to say Sue's name out of appreciation.

276
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
So this is a one butt hole salute to Sue.

277
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Sue.

278
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Sue.

279
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Sue.

280
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Sue.

281
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Sue.

282
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Sue.

283
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Sue.

284
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Sue.

285
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
What a interview.

286
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Sue.

287
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Sue.

288
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Sue.

289
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Sue.

290
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Sue.

291
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Sue.

292
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Sue.

293
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Sue.

294
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
So.

295
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Sue.

296
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Sue.

297
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Sue.

298
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Sue.

299
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Sue.

300
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Sue.

301
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Sue.

302
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Sue.

303
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Sue.

304
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Sue.

305
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Sue.

306
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Sue.

307
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Sue.

308
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Sue.

309
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Sue.

310
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Sue.

311
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Sue.

312
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Sue.

313
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Sue.

314
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
just to talk to when I just handed the headphones off.

315
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,640
And so here's what happened.

316
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,920
So I had the headphones back on.

317
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,040
And this, you know, Christina's here with a girlfriend

318
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
and Patricia's rock walking around the in-laws.

319
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
And it's a lot of noise in the house.

320
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,040
And Samadcha's, oh, put Christina on it.

321
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
So I call Christina, I call her again.

322
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
And it's like unbelievable, you know,

323
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,040
I know she just walked away.

324
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,680
So how can she not hear me?

325
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
But there's also this general noise

326
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,840
that we have at the cottage, now the in-laws are here.

327
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,000
And it was just a full house.

328
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,120
And both Madge and Reagan Fox kind of glomed

329
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,280
on to the same thing here.

330
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,120
Check this out.

331
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,680
I was listening to East Radio today in Madge

332
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,000
interviewed Adam Curry and Adam Curry

333
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
had a very, very Joan Crawford moment.

334
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,280
His daughter's name is Christina.

335
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,000
Christina Curry, not to be confused with the other CC.

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,440
Christina Crawford.

337
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm just talking to Madge, Christina.

338
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,360
Tell her hello for me.

339
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,400
Yeah, Christina says hi.

340
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,880
Can you put her on the phone or something?

341
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,960
Oh, Christina, Christina.

342
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,920
I'm not mad at you.

343
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,440
Christina.

344
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm mad at the Christina.

345
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,440
I'm not going to do it now.

346
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,000
It sounds like I don't Crawford and let me

347
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
do her as a 10-year-old girl.

348
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Yeah, Christina.

349
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,440
I'm just talking to Madge.

350
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,560
I'm just talking to Madge.

351
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm just talking to Madge.

352
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
I'm just talking to Madge.

353
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm just talking to Madge.

354
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,920
Can you put her on the phone or something?

355
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,520
Oh, Christina.

356
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,120
Christina.

357
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,520
Hi, I'm Christina.

358
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Christina.

359
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,360
Oh my God.

360
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,920
You sound like a Joan Crawford mommy,

361
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,560
do you hear us 10-year-old go death?

362
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
If you can't do that.

363
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,360
I don't do it at all.

364
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,240
These are the moments that make life worth living.

365
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,200
Christina.

366
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,320
Why are you doing that, Calvin?

367
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,160
Christina.

368
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,120
No, no.

369
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,440
This is the teacher.

370
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
Christina.

371
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
No, I'm just going to the police.

372
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,080
Christina.

373
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,120
Police is going and looking like a truck.

374
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
Christina, Christina, Christina, Christina, Christina.

375
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,600
Christina.

376
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,480
Oh my God.

377
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,120
This moment of podcasting hilarity is brought to you

378
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,440
by Reagan Fox.

379
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
Fox in the city.

380
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,760
Reagan Fox.com.

381
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,040
That's R-A-G-A-N.

382
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,880
Amazingly funny, yet somehow very disturbing.

383
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,400
Thank you very much.

384
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,640
It's brought a love summertime in the source code.

385
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:18,640
When I was young, I'm talking about the good times.

386
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,360
Just doing it.

387
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,840
Ha-ha.

388
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,680
When the time we ever cared about,

389
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,920
we had it all, we had it all, oh.

390
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,960
I'm talking about the good times.

391
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,280
Drinking all day, drinking all night.

392
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,360
Dance by the firelight.

393
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,200
Come on.

394
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,320
Because you are the one that's hard at the end.

395
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,120
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

396
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
You didn't put that on.

397
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,560
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

398
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,760
So much time.

399
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,360
You're all ready.

400
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200
What?

401
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm talking about the simple times.

402
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Hey, it's a cool, no right, no road.

403
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Read the lies from the obvious song.

404
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Make our way up to Prost-Ret's Fund.

405
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,640
I'm talking about the good times.

406
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,240
No reason to find, because Bradley is tied,

407
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,040
and never think it's alright.

408
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Make our way up to Prost-Ret's Fund.

409
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:57,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

410
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:04,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

411
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,040
I'm talking about the good times.

412
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

413
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

414
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

415
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:30,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

416
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

417
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:42,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

418
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,040
I'm talking about the good times.

419
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

420
00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:03,040
You know that you are the one that's hard at the end.

421
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Currently number one on the podcast music network in pod plays.

422
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,040
It's brother love summertime.

423
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
And it's unbelievable.

424
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
This thing has the most plays.

425
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
I think the most listens.

426
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Not the highest rated though, which is interesting,

427
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:25,040
because listeners can rate songs on the podcast music network.com or music.podshow.com.

428
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,040
I am so loving what's going on there.

429
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
It's really quite amazing.

430
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Particularly the top 10 list.

431
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,040
So I'm wondering, is that something that gets cleared out at the beginning of

432
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,040
the month or is it top, you know,

433
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
the pod plays be of all time.

434
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Because then, you know, we may not get new bands on very quickly in the top 10 list,

435
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,040
which is I think the same way podcast alley does it now,

436
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,040
where you have the top 10 is reset every month.

437
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,040
And on Fridays, we actually air the podcast alley top 10 on serious satellite.

438
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Four hours worth of podcast.

439
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,040
And it is, it is very cool to see that, you know, now that everything's been cleared out,

440
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,040
usually it takes two or two and a half weeks before stuff kind of settles.

441
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,040
And then it gets cleared out again right after, after four weeks.

442
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
So the chart is constantly changing.

443
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
There's a pretty fair way of doing it.

444
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,040
So yesterday, I didn't do a source code because so many people had problems getting

445
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,040
to the source code due to my error of placing a hash mark in the URL.

446
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Learn something new there.

447
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Won't be doing that.

448
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Although we're experimenting with some of our infrastructure over the next four

449
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,040
to eight hours, so you may not get this file as usual,

450
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
or you might have to wait for repose.

451
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,040
I'm not quite sure what's going to happen.

452
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,040
So bear with me and I really appreciate it when you tell me when you send me reports.

453
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Yeah, I appreciate it.

454
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
I get lots of them.

455
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,040
When something goes wrong with the show, I get lots of reports.

456
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
But I do appreciate you letting me know.

457
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Usually people say, well, this is probably the five hundred email you've received.

458
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,040
And I'm always worried about saying, don't send it to me because then, you know,

459
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,040
people might not send anything thinking that someone already did send it to me.

460
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
So you know, keep the warnings coming.

461
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
It's okay.

462
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
I can sit through the email.

463
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,040
So I did have some time yesterday to geek out some more on this GPS stuff.

464
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
And I'm not quite sure where it's going still.

465
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
And what the use to mankind is going to be,

466
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
but I'm really totally enjoying this.

467
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
We went to get the wood.

468
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,040
And so this, what is it?

469
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Blue tech, a real tech GPS, bluetooth GPS unit that I have.

470
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,040
It can log 30,000 data points internally just by itself.

471
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
So you don't need to hook it up to your pocket PC or anything.

472
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,040
And you can just take this little box along.

473
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Just put it on your dashboard and you're good to go.

474
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,040
So it recorded the route.

475
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,040
You know, from the cottage all the way to the, to the hardware store.

476
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
And then back to the cottage.

477
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,040
And then I finally figured out how to turn that into pure,

478
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,040
NEMA data, N Mia data, November, Mike echo alpha data.

479
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Whatever the hell that stands for.

480
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Notical, meteorological, something or other.

481
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:03,040
And then the real format that seems to be whatever one's developing against is

482
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,040
GPS, the GPS exchange format, which is a version of, it's an XML format.

483
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,040
And I'm already here in some people going, well,

484
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Boo, this may not be whatever, but I'm telling you,

485
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
GPS seems to be the prevalent format.

486
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,040
And there are lots of cool little sites where you can upload your GPS

487
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
and it'll draw you a Google map.

488
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,040
But the most exhilarating thing I saw was with Google Earth.

489
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,040
If you haven't downloaded Google Earth yet, do it.

490
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Because it's a free application.

491
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
And it's basically a 3D rendering of the globe.

492
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
And you can fly to places.

493
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,040
You can swoop in and see both road maps.

494
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,040
And you know, hybrid with photographic overlays.

495
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Although the US is much better than the rest of the world.

496
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
You can get down to much greater detail.

497
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,040
But at least you can kind of see, you know, like the leisure centering

498
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Guilford.

499
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,040
It's big enough for me to see kind of the white colors on the photograph.

500
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Hey, huh?

501
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
What's up?

502
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Packing.

503
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Packing?

504
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Oh, that's right.

505
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
She's packing for tomorrow.

506
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
I have the most amazing suitcase.

507
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,040
It's the automatic self-packing unpacking suitcase.

508
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Yeah.

509
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,040
What do I have to do?

510
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
What stuff do I have to do?

511
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Oh, everything got taken care of.

512
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Take it to a paid for credit card companies happy.

513
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
We have a hotel.

514
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
I'll see that you are far.

515
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
I know.

516
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
But that took fucking hours this time.

517
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Usually it's really easy.

518
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,040
I try to get the better end of the deal.

519
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
I know.

520
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Okay.

521
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
So anyway, GPX format.

522
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
I'm sorry.

523
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
I'm geeking out here, huh?

524
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
I know you're geeking.

525
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah.

526
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
And GPS shit.

527
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,040
So you load that into Google Earth.

528
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
When you're so geeky.

529
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Really?

530
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Yeah.

531
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,040
I'll show you how to load my GPX into your Google Earth.

532
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Hold on.

533
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Well, I just got a message.

534
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
What was that?

535
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
Still in Florida.

536
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Okay.

537
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
I guess Ron didn't go to Texas yet.

538
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
He's still in Florida.

539
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Yeah.

540
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
I don't know.

541
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Maybe he's still able to get some more stuff ready before leaving.

542
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Yeah.

543
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
They're going to be in San Francisco for a long time.

544
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Oh, when we are there, they're going to be there too.

545
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Yeah.

546
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Well, first they go.

547
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
They're going to Texas.

548
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Remember for a wedding?

549
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Can't get rid of this guy anymore.

550
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Can't be.

551
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
No, of course not.

552
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
No, no.

553
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
All right.

554
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
So now my mother-in-law's walked into.

555
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Hey, Alice.

556
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Hi.

557
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
How are you?

558
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm fine.

559
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Thank you.

560
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Hi.

561
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
All right.

562
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm going to continue with the GPX format if you don't mind.

563
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,040
So you can load this into Google Earth.

564
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,040
And you can, you know, you can set the camera angle.

565
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
You can set how far out you're viewing.

566
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
You can fly over the route that you took.

567
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,040
It's really, it's really cool.

568
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,040
So now I want to spend a little more time figuring out how to add waypoints.

569
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
I guess I can figure that out.

570
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I'd like it to be automatic where I kind of just drop in a file of pictures.

571
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
And it picks up the time code and paste them in the appropriate spot.

572
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,040
And then, of course, the real trick is to synchronize that with audio.

573
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,040
And once we have those three pieces together, and I think maybe the Google Earth viewer

574
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,040
is the right application to develop this against.

575
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:11,040
And unless, of course, someone's even better on maybe the Google Maps API is better to use

576
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
because the API is there.

577
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
I haven't looked at it.

578
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
And I don't know what it can do.

579
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,040
But essentially what you want to do is you want to upload your GPX data file.

580
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:25,040
You want to upload your pictures and your pictures all have time stamps in the file.

581
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,040
So you can align those two up with waypoints or data protract points.

582
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,040
And then, of course, you want to have it synced in real time to a podcast, to an MP3 file,

583
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,040
which I think also has, I wonder how we do the time code on the MP3.

584
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Well, I have to think about that.

585
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Maybe you'd have to sync it up somehow.

586
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:53,040
But if we could have that and the output be a quick time movie or the output be something that runs

587
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:03,040
in flash or just runs on the internet like the Google Maps API is interactive.

588
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,040
If we have that, and these pictures can pop up at certain points and you could stop,

589
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,040
and you could take a bigger look at the picture and you could add URLs.

590
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Then, I think we've got something really fucking cool.

591
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
So that's just my shout out.

592
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Please don't make me develop this.

593
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
You heard him at the opening of the show.

594
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Might as well roll him out at the end of the show.

595
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Cruise box.

596
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Tell the FCC to stick a kick and I heard it on the podcast.

597
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
Do you remember?

598
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
We back last summer.

599
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,040
When mainstream radio was such a fucking monomer.

600
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
No Indian music.

601
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Nothing to funny.

602
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Cleared channel.

603
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Motherfuckers.

604
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
They had a problem on it.

605
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,040
But somebody heard it wrong.

606
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Now you can have it all.

607
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,040
I heard it on the podcast.

608
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Rock and fucking radio.

609
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
You want it.

610
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Got it.

611
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Just download it and hide it on the podcast.

612
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
No one's going to stop.

613
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,040
You're telling FCC to stick and pick it.

614
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
The revolution is on.

615
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Do you remember?

616
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Your first computer.

617
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,040
That piece of shit was like a freaking rotor.

618
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Now we've got Wi-Fi.

619
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Downloading files fast.

620
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,040
This meant to everyone who's ever done on podcast.

621
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
It's his duty.

622
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Now you see.

623
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Each and every nation.

624
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
The radio is got to cool.

625
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
It's our imagination.

626
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Me that song.

627
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Sing a loud mash it up.

628
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
It makes it real.

629
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
It's fucking built up.

630
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
I can't fix it.

631
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
You're so bad.

632
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Hear it.

633
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Come on.

634
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Now you can have it all.

635
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:28,040
You can make your real sound.

636
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I heard it on the podcast.

637
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Rock and fucking radio.

638
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
You want it.

639
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Got it.

640
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Just download it and hide it on the podcast.

641
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
No one's going to stop.

642
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,040
You're telling FCC to stick and pick it.

643
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,040
The revolution is on the podcast.

644
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Rock and fucking radio.

645
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
You want it.

646
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Got it.

647
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Just download it and hide it on the podcast.

648
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040

You're telling FCC to stick and pick it.

650
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,040
The revolution is on the podcast.

651
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,040
The revolution is on the podcast.

652
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,040
You're telling FCC to stick and pick it.

653
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,040
The revolution is on the podcast.

654
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,040
The revolution is on the podcast.

655
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,040
The revolution is on the podcast.

656
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,040
The revolution is on the podcast.

657
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,040
The revolution is on the podcast.

658
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Crew's box.

659
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
FCC.

660
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Stick it.

661
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Kick it.

662
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
The revolution is on.

663
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
That's it for the source code for today.

664
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
August 4th.

665
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
2005.

666
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,040
It's not anniversary tomorrow.

667
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Is it tomorrow when we're flying?

668
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Tomorrow's the 5th, right?

669
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
August 5th.

670
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,040
I told you I told you she didn't know either.

671
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
But how long has it been?

672
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Long time.

673
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
You love me.

674
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Long time.

675
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,040
I love you.

676
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Long time.

677
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,040
18.

678
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,040
But it feels like.

679
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
20 new old 19 years.

680
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
We know each other.

681
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Yeah.

682
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Feels like the first time baby.

683
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I was such a kid.

684
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
I'm no longer a call.

685
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
I don't.

686
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
I don't qualify.

687
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I was a young boy.

688
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Now I'm a smelly man.

689
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Yeah.

690
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
All right.

691
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Thank you very much for checking us out.

692
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Tomorrow starts the vacation cast.

693
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:40,040
I guess there'll be lots of little bits from the road.

694
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Kind of sound seen to it, right?

695
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
I guess so.

696
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
It's time we go out.

697
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
We always wear a mic.

698
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,040
We have to take everybody.

699
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,040
If life is worth living, it's worth documenting.

700
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
That's what ever we do.

701
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,040
That's right.

702
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
No.

703
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
