00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
POT show the podcast cool kids go for Delta Shara Charlie 2 9 or 8

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:31,080
They're on to your room and pack up a suitcase we got a lead for hotel out of this place we got a move

3
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:43,080
Yeah I mean move I got dangerous men hop on my heels there's a damn shame where ain't got some faster wheels but there's a wheel

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,080
She's gonna have to do it's time I have me a heart to heart whether you

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I got some good news and I got some bad news on it either way I've done this wrong

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Well I could tell you but we'd better start running because the good news is the money is gone

7
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,080
When the game began I had a handful of cash I was up a couple grand when my luck just crashed so I borrowed from the bank

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:38,080
And I drank and I drank what is can't look good girl I know what you must think

9
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:51,080
I got some good news and I got some bad news on it either way I've done this wrong

10
00:01:51,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Well I could tell you but we'd better start running because the good news is the money is gone

11
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Yeah I got some good news and I got some bad news on it either way I've done this wrong

12
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Well I could tell you but we'd better start running because the good news is the money is gone

13
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Yeah as we heard about that dress I said I was gonna buy it

14
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Maybe we could skip rodeo drive and think more like rodeo style or something

15
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,080
We could start drinking the generic beer for a while

16
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:25,080
You know we evaluate our taste and steak and go from quarter house

17
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,080
The jack in a box or something like that Sean Patrick McGraw and the good news is it's from his songs for Saturday night

18
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,080
You might remember him from little in love I'm a sucker for some country man from the pod safe music network which you can find at music.podshow.com

19
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Hey everybody how you doing this is the daily source code coming to you from curry condo in San Francisco California I had a great day

20
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:57,080
It is actually it's Wednesday now in San Francisco technically it's Wednesday. I was actually really really late for me what a fantastic day

21
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:14,080
It started off just well it started off great 630 there's the alarm clock because we're starting at 8 o'clock every single morning everybody's in HQ because we had so much going on today we started I mean God it was just it was so good everything really finally

22
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Started to come together you know it's so exciting when you're when you're building a new company and and also it just starts to click you know

23
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,080
And of course we had our move today to the new offices

24
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Today was the first time I drove to work in Trinity and Trinity of course is my new bio diesel beast

25
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Oh, it's a one had a name for it

26
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,080
The pod not was it pod pod cruiser

27
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Oh, no pod racer that's what it was yeah the pod racer nah I like Trinity much better that's her name and that's what we're going to call her and

28
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,080
And got lots of lots of feedback and if you don't know what I'm talking about this is the Mercedes Benz

29
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:12,080
1985 Benz station wagon 300 turbo diesel that runs on biodiesel. I've learned so much just today alone about this about this engine which indeed is five cylinders. It's completely right

30
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:23,080
The engine takes nine b99 or that's what it's what's in it right now. It'll actually it'll take almost anything b99

31
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Which is 99 percent night I think even 99.9 percent recycled vegetable oil and it runs like a char it just it works

32
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:43,080
I found out that the place in Berkeley in Berkeley, California where I can go fill her up with b99 is the Berkeley biodiesel oasis

33
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:50,080
I can't wait to go meet these people it sounds like they've got everything that you can buy big gallons full of this stuff and take it with you

34
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
And they've got special you know, I don't know they got all kinds of stuff which we're going to find out about

35
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,080
But I did some reading on their website and gosh, it's it's just fascinating

36
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:18,080
So you have the 99 b99 you also have the SVO which stands for straight vegetable oil because you can indeed just you can go get a bottle of vegetable oil and port right into the tank now the danger with that is if it gets too cold outside

37
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Wherever the car is or wherever you're driving and I guess the SVO can start to gel and then of course I would clog up your fuel lines and then it wouldn't function it would just stop

38
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,080
So that's why you have the b99 or you can go and get a kit which will heat up this this SVO

39
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:43,080
So I'm learning more and more about about how this all fits together how it works, of course you can always just throw in you know diesel oil if you want

40
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,080
So excited about this not because of you know some kind of I'm not a greeny by by any standard I do care about the environment

41
00:06:50,080 --> 00:07:00,080
But I think what I'm most excited about is there's no more dependency you know, it's like we don't have to depend on foreign oil

42
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Any oil for that matter. It's completely screwing everything else up. I love it. That's in fact

43
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,080
I just realized that the movie water world with Kevin Costner makes no sense now not water world

44
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm sorry, I'm not thinking I am thinking about Mad Max

45
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:29,080
You know these guys didn't need diesel oil to you know oil based petroleum to to run all their engines off of they could have used corn seed oil or cotton seed oil or

46
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Oh my gosh, I think even hemp oil would be wouldn't that be great. It's so easy to grow

47
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:46,080
I got a couple emails regarding Trinity from Malcolm and Dubai. I add them your picks of Trinity make me wonder if this car was imported to the US after serving in Germany as a taxi

48
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,080
The color seems to be the unique shade used by taxi operators throughout the federal Republic

49
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Following your biodiesel adventures with interest in planning a podcast. We remain here and do buy your loyal listeners. Thank you very much Malcolm

50
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
I don't know the color

51
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,080
Someone wrote someone on a combat that the color is eggnog yellow

52
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Eggnog with rum actually

53
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,080
That's about the color of this wonderful machine and it could be

54
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,080
I don't know how would I find out if this if this machine was imported is there any way to see that and the VIN number or anything like that

55
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Is any way to trace its history I guess is what I'm looking for

56
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Good old match

57
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,080
sent me a short note she said what you need for the cars a new song kind of like Chitty Chitty bang bang

58
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Oh, yeah Trinity definitely needs a theme song and then

59
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Joe McLaughlin says hey man, you should definitely pimp that ride west coast customs

60
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't know where is west coast customs let me click on the link here west coast customs.com

61
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Are they in San Francisco or are they in California or in Los Angeles let me see

62
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
T-shirts

63
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,080
The hell does that one if they just tell me where they are

64
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Okay, no idea

65
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Doesn't say on the site actually

66
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Wait corporate site maybe that's at 310. Okay, so that's going to be

67
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,080
That's going to be Los Angeles too bad here contact info. Let me just check and see what their

68
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Jesus Christ man, don't you just tell me where you are where you're located

69
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Okay, 310 is definitely not here in San Francisco, but I'd much rather pimp it out with

70
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,080
With some source code listeners who were out there who in the Bay area

71
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Who have some ideas I've gotten lots of great photo shops and all kinds of great

72
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
I you know great logos and versions of the car in different colors

73
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,080
But is there anyone who can really come here and do it Steve web by the way from the

74
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Life Spring podcast he shot me off a really short email

75
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Earlier today and I actually did know that Steve's what Steve does for a living

76
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:58,080
This is a fantastic inspirational podcast that I certainly suggest you listen to if you have time

77
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Steve during the day when he's not podcasting for a living he repairs car windshields

78
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,080
And I have two like major stars right on the on the windscreen and

79
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm hoping that we can hook up and Steve can fix that. I actually don't even know how that works

80
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:24,080
So we'll do a little a little instructional podcast of saving trinities windscreen

81
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Brett Viren says Adam, you know, yes, they were talking about the new razor that I'm trying out this Wilkinson for blade

82
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Now Brett sent me an email was something really interesting. I don't know how this can be true

83
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:47,080
He says for the past 10 plus years I've been using the same double blade razor all through that time

84
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Those two blades have happily cut my throat

85
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Mange, mange, mange, throat, mange, mange, mange, mange, mange,

86
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Truath is that once it gets a little dull the blades don't get any dollar

87
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,920
Is that really true? I mean when when blades get dulled, do they stay at that same dullness they don't get any dollar any

88
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Razer blade technicians out there that can fill me in on this is that really true

89
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,080
And I don't know I have always just tossed it after a while

90
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,080
So I'm okay now it's dull and now it's time to get rid of it and arguably does work

91
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,560
Arguably, it does work, but how well does it work and does it maintain that same level?

92
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,280
I don't know. Let me know, Adam at Curie.com.

93
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,880
Found another great song on the Pods Safe Music Network.

94
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,080
Oh, I just let me say one more thing about how great today was and how excited

95
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,880
I have and how everything really started to come together.

96
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,960
It was so good today that Ron and I have scheduled to do or have scheduled

97
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,720
ourselves to do a strategy cast tomorrow night, so that will, to whom will that

98
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,920
air? That'll air, I guess Thursday or Friday.

99
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,120
I mean, we'll keep it for the weekend, but I think we're going to record it

100
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,640
Thursday night and I'm very excited about lots of the things that we're going to

101
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,000
be able to tell you. And so we start peeling back some of the, some of the

102
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,400
layers of the, of the nasty smelling pod show onion. And that's only because

103
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,480
Chris Rockwell is not doing the poop cast, you know. So he's got to be doing it

104
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,640
somewhere within the onion. On the Pods Safe Music Network, I came across a song

105
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,000
which I will dub the wiki PDF blues.

106
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I take a look at my enormous penis and my troubles start to melt into a bow.

107
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:04,400
I take a look at my enormous penis and happy times are coming to stay.

108
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:12,400
I got to sing and I dance when I glancing my pants and the feeling like a sunshine day.

109
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,400
I take a look at my enormous penis.

110
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Everything is going my way.

111
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,400
The Vinci's notebook. It's just a sample. I don't know why didn't put the whole song up.

112
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,400
An enormous penis. Fantastic. That really made me smile. I got to tell you. Great.

113
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Okay. You may be listening to this show, The Daily Source Code, on serious satellite radio,

114
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,360
stars 103. I want to play a song for you that regular listeners to the pod

115
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,360
cast have heard many, many times, certainly because if they listen to this show, I'm sure

116
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
they listen to other podcasts.

117
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,360
The reason why I want to play it right now is because this song is the proceeds of this song,

118
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,360
which include royalties, performance royalties, which are paid through ASCAP and BMI,

119
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:07,360
go to UNICEF that's been graciously donated by the writers and producers of the song,

120
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Slough and Orlando. When I play the song on the podcast in the satellite window,

121
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:22,360
that coincides with serious satellite radio, that gets written down somewhere.

122
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I don't know. I have no idea how much it is, but it's definitely some money that goes to UNICEF.

123
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I can't tell the other members of the pod squad of the serious line-up, of course,

124
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,360
after the Daily Source Code, is when we roll out Pacifico's railway, then we have Madge Weinstein.

125
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Madge doing a full hour now on serious, followed by Don and Drew and then we've got Pida,

126
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,360
we've got Wichita, we've got Frank No, I think he does some Frank Truth in there.

127
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,360
We've got the music pod casters. I can't tell them what to do. I can't, I don't want to tell them what to do.

128
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:07,360
However, if they do play this song and it's played on serious, then that definitely counts towards money going to UNICEF.

129
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:16,360
In addition, I'm hoping that some of the terrestrial broadcasters and other serious satellite radio

130
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,360
and personalities and producers will pick up on it and maybe we can get some more airplay.

131
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,360
You can check out the whole backstory to this on HotSafeRepeat.org.

132
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
If every day we're Christmas.

133
00:15:51,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Christmas tree. People are shopping for them loved ones.

134
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,360
I'm making plans for a Christmas feast.

135
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:20,360
But it all goes by and then we have to wait another year.

136
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:30,360
What if every day, Christmas, what are one of the more?

137
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
This one tree.

138
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,360
People never feel blue. We make all our dreams come true.

139
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,360
If Christmas were every day.

140
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

141
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:10,360
I just look around now and you will see it. Everybody's nice and full of life.

142
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:16,360
And they give to those who aren't me.

143
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:26,360
What if every day, Christmas, what are one of the more?

144
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,360
This one tree.

145
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,360
We make all our dreams come true.

146
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,360
If Christmas were every day.

147
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

148
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
If Christmas was every day.

149
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

150
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,360
If Christmas was every day.

151
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

152
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Christmas, what are one of the more?

153
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
This one tree.

154
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,360
We would never feel blue.

155
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
We make all our dreams come true.

156
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,360
If Christmas was every day.

157
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

158
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
This one tree.

159
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,360
We make all our dreams come true.

160
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
If Christmas was every day.

161
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

162
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,360
If Christmas was every day.

163
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

164
00:18:50,360 --> 00:19:00,360
If Christmas was every day.

165
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

166
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,360
If Christmas was every day.

167
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

168
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,360
If Christmas was every day.

169
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

170
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,360
If Christmas was every day.

171
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

172
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,360
If Christmas was every day.

173
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

174
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,360
If Christmas was every day.

175
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,360
It was time to bring out the good people.

176
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:58,360
If Christmas was every day.

177
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,360
They are not competing because they think they can sing.

178
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,360
If Christmas was every day.

179
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,360
They are not competing because they think they can survive.

180
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,960
five in the jungle.

181
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,000
All right, you better get me out of here.

182
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,720
Hey, guys, guys, guys.

183
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,120
Guys, they're competing because they think they've got

184
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,320
what it takes to make it in the biz.

185
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,320
The biz is a new kind of reality show, only online.

186
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,040
Watch as nine finalists battle for the best job in America,

187
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,720
running a one-armed music record label.

188
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,920
They'll take on tough challenges and even tougher.

189
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,880
Each other is they try to impress music industry,

190
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,640
heavy hitters, and artists like Fallow, Jason, Ramsey,

191
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,080
and many more.

192
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,320
The biz, it's serious competition.

193
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,400
And it's only online free at almusic.com.

Go to almusic.com now.

199
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,360
I was thinking, listen to that spot there, I was thinking,

200
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,840
what does it mean when they start doing reality shows

201
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,280
about your industry?

202
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,920
That can't be a good thing.

203
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,280
It just can't.

204
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,040
When we're doing reality shows,

205
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,280
and by the way, an audio reality show is also something

206
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,560
that's very interesting, when they're doing that

207
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,600
about your industry, that means your industry is a mockery.

208
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,840
It really does.

209
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,480
So how long before we start hearing, oh, I don't know,

210
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,080
the reality shows about, oh, gee, reality shows

211
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,800
about radio stations, now I guess we already had that.

212
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,800
WKRP and Cincinnati, I wasn't a reality show

213
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,240
was more of a soap, but when we get reality shows

214
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,720
about disjockeys, then you'll know it's really over.

215
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,520
Excuse me, for those you listened to the podcast,

216
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,200
we're about to lose our satellite window on serious.

217
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,840
I'm to continue, I got cool stuff to talk about,

218
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,440
talk about blank media taxes and different countries

219
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,840
around the world, got some feedback on iTunes

220
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,400
and their top 100 and how that works.

221
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,520
I'm also some help being offered for my Macintosh woes,

222
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,120
once I get back, you know, by the way,

223
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,440
since the community Mac blew up at home,

224
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,640
I put the studio production, I Mac downstairs

225
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,960
and the kitchen, it looks beautiful, by the way,

226
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,800
fits perfectly.

227
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,120
Patricia calls it her station.

228
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,560
She's got her flat screen TV, the next to it

229
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,960
she's got her eye Mac, she's so completely happening.

230
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
She's got eye chat up all the time

231
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,000
and the presence thing really works

232
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,240
because she moves the mouse whatever in the morning.

233
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,560
She's checking mail regularly,

234
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,200
she's sending mail regularly

235
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,520
and we're actually having little chats back and forth,

236
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,560
before she had to walk upstairs into the studio,

237
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,000
the second bedroom, what I call the studio

238
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and she would basically have to either log in

239
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,160
or just have, it would be a whole chore.

240
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,760
Now, the kitchen is really where we,

241
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,120
I think that's the room we hang out in the most.

242
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,480
It's really, well, the kitchen is really the community room,

243
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,800
it's a nice big long kitchen,

244
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,280
we have a breakfast milk,

245
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,840
which is really where we enjoy all of our meals,

246
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
Patricia cooks every single day

247
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,240
and I am often invited to help out,

248
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,640
which I like very much.

249
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,360
I am the sous chef of the Katage and it's just perfect.

250
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,800
So she's there, she's in full communication.

251
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
So of course, when I get back,

252
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
we're gonna have a little issue because

253
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,880
I'm gonna have to pull the needle out of the main line.

254
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,680
So I gotta order her, her own eye mat,

255
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,640
come to this, this is the old one,

256
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,720
the older model that I never, of course,

257
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,920
switched for the new one, which I should have done,

258
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,440
kinda got bone done, buying the last ones in stock.

259
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,000
Well, anyway, I'm gonna get her a new one

260
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,600
with a camera built in and then she'll be completely cyber,

261
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,200
my cyber bed and she's gonna get a Bluetooth headset

262
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
that works perfectly with Skype.

263
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,680
I've got this little Motorola Bluetooth thing

264
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,760
that you hang onto your ear, which is really meant

265
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,960
for the blackberry, but it paired up perfectly

266
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,720
with Bluetooth on the eye mat and it just works like a charm.

267
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,080
Coming up next on the serious stars 103,

268
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,440
if you're listening to the show on the satellite,

269
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,280
it is a specific coast hellway

270
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,040
with Mark Yoshimoto-Nenkov.

271
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,320
So enjoy that and I'll see you tomorrow.

272
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,600
And those of you who are still listening to me,

273
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,240
you get all the good shit man, this is the podcast,

274
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,920
this is where we can go for as long as we want.

275
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I've changed it now, you know,

276
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
imagine how it has an hour,

277
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,080
so I'm just taking half an hour on serious

278
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,680
with whatever commercials and stuff they put in between,

279
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,360
I only have to do, what is it, 24 and a half minutes.

280
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,560
So that way I can also shorten the daily source code

281
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,880
a little bit, it really felt to me

282
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,280
like it was just running too long, you know?

283
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,320
And I want to make sure that,

284
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,520
I mean, either I'm gonna do a long show every couple of days,

285
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,840
or I'm gonna do shorter shows every single day.

286
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
And it's also is really, really draining.

287
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,280
And by the way, I feel like crap from this jet lag,

288
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,600
somehow it really hit me hard this time around.

289
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,920
It's a day for the first time in God.

290
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,600
I'm gonna say easily, easily eight or nine years,

291
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,360
but first time I actually had an alcohol cell tower.

292
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,200
This is the unit that got to the world

293
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,360
and I can maybe let it go hit in all news of the CIA.

294
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,280
It was supposed to be part safe metal manual,

295
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,900
Saturday nights at우 intévin fossil,

296
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,800
rockcom.

297
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,500
See you back to Clara, Snapchat.

298
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,880
Cause obviously no, she didn't know.

299
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,800
Uh hah hah ahhhh

300
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,260
hah hah hah hah hah hah hah

301
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,860
Hi, this is Larry LeCost.

302
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,460
And this is Chris Delucas with the Daily Journal podcast.

303
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,620
We want to wish you happy holidays.

304
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,660
Hey Adam, how are you doing?

305
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
I know you're always doing fine.

306
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,760
Hey, this is a happy podcast from the Netherlands.

307
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,460
And by the way, my name is Mark Bosch.

308
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,160
And why am I so happy?

309
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,760
Because I can make my own show on a podcast.

310
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,560
There's no boss behind me saying, hey, you can't say this only.

311
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,760
You can't say that on there.

312
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,360
I used to work for local way of stations.

313
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,760
And even the local stations, they will have a boss saying,

314
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
what you're getting, what you can't do.

315
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,860
And here I can do whatever I want.

316
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,160
I can play the music I like.

317
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,960
I pick it myself from the pot-safe music network.

318
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,360
They even sent me emails when I played it.

319
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,960
Thank you for playing last song and that's so cool.

320
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,960
I never received an email from a dollar saying,

321
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,760
thank you for playing last song when I was on radio.

322
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,160
It's thinking to answer it.

323
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,160
That's a little difference.

324
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,560
In the test, there's a big thing going on here.

325
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,160
What I particularly like is that I can create my own podcast.

326
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,560
And I didn't think about this.

327
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,560
I just wanted to be in there.

328
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,960
And I started my podcast.

329
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,560
I do have to think of a team.

330
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,760
But I didn't do the jet.

331
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
I started in talking about my gadgets,

332
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,560
talking about my technology, all the things I like.

333
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,160
And I do have listeners more than I even expect it.

334
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,760
OK, I will come up with a team.

335
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,760
And I was thinking about that top 40, maybe,

336
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,760
and like a tip of it, like Spartan came up with a tip of it

337
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,760
in the Netherlands for conventional music.

338
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,760
But I was thinking about the tip of it for pot-safe music.

339
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,760
The pot tip 20 or something every Friday afternoon.

340
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
How cool would that be?

341
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Thinking about all those concepts.

342
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,760
But for now, I'm just doing my thing, doing my music,

343
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,760
doing talking about the things I like.

344
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
And I do have listeners.

345
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,760
I do love podcasting, the new medium.

346
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
And I just wanted to let you know that.

347
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
This is another heavy potcaster from the Netherlands,

348
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,760
wishing you a great time in California.

349
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,760
And he done sick.

350
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,760
And Michael podcasts is available on the websites.

351
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,760
www.markpast.com.

352
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,760
www.maarka.rs.com.

353
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,760
I really just wanted to play that because any podcaster,

354
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,760
who says it's a happy podcaster, just makes me smile.

355
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
That's great.

356
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
Cool idea, man.

357
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,760
There's lots of people doing all kinds of shows.

358
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
We've got the pod-safe music countdown.

359
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
We've got the show.

360
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,760
You know what I haven't seen show up in my...

361
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,760
My playlist recently is the ultimate mix pod cast.

362
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,760
I wonder if I still hang it in there.

363
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
I really like that one. That was a great show.

364
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Once again today, another 40-50 songs uploaded to the PMman.

365
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
It's just fricking outrageous.

366
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
This is catch and fire.

367
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
It's really, really happening.

368
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Let's see, what was I going to talk about?

369
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Oh, yes.

370
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Okay, so back to the Macintosh that busted upstairs.

371
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
A couple people sent me the same information.

372
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
I basically said,

373
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Give up on Norton.

374
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Everyone else did.

375
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
This is from Kurt Lewis.

376
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,760
It says Norton was the tool for the old Mac OS,

377
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
but not in Mac OS X or X or X.

378
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
They like stuff.

379
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,760
It sucked the sweat off right nossorous testicles.

380
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,760
I recommend disc warrior by Alsoft.

381
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
It fixes problems.

382
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
This utility can't.

383
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Thank you very much everyone who suggested using that night.

384
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,760
It disc utility recognizes the drive.

385
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
The smart status is verified,

386
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,760
but it can't mount the drive because the B3 catalog is hose.

387
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
So I guess I'll get a copy of this warrior.

388
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,760
I really hope I can because there's some shit on that drive.

389
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
I'd like to say,

390
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
I'm getting a warning from it, man.

391
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
It went boom.

392
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
It was gone.

393
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
It seems like three, four years.

394
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
And there are IBM drives.

395
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
They suck.

396
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
So why only three, four years?

397
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Can't you send me an email that you're going to fail?

398
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Let me see.

399
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Andy Masters from Edinburgh.

400
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Oh, this is about the iTunes top 100.

401
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
He says, I subscribed to,

402
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
this is, remember I talked about in business.

403
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
So when I'll send me an email saying,

404
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
how can a business be in the top 100

405
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
if they haven't done a show in months?

406
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,760
So Andy says he subscribed to in business recently

407
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
because although there's no content just yet,

408
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
I want it here.

409
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,760
I want to hear it when the new series starts up again.

410
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,760
So it's getting subscriptions based on people's expectations

411
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,760
of future high quality content.

412
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
So it almost makes sense.

413
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,760
An interesting that something as simple as the top 100

414
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
can actually be implemented in lots of different ways.

415
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Yeah, no kidding.

416
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,760
Dude, have you ever even talked to anyone who knows

417
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,760
about voting and how votes to be counted?

418
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
And, oh, man.

419
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Yes.

420
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Top 100s can be done in many different ways.

421
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Should it measure change as it does at the moment?

422
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,760
What about unsubscribes?

423
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Or the raw number of downloads should a podcast

424
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,760
that transmit seven episodes a week at seven votes

425
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
compared to a once a week show?

426
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Good question.

427
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Podcasting asks a whole heap of new questions

428
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
to people trying to measure if something is,

429
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
quote, popular or not.

430
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,760
The really important thing that whether or not you're in the top 100

431
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
may just be vanity for content producers,

432
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,760
but actually effect what kind of content they produce.

433
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,760
He says he knows about it because he did a show

434
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,760
and he dropped from 57 to 99.

435
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
So whatever he did there, he won't do it again.

436
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Yeah, you know, I think the list are really good.

437
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I like all these different top 100 lists and top 10 lists.

438
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,760
I do think it's almost required

439
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,760
that the publisher of the list really explains

440
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
how the list is compiled.

441
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Otherwise it's just, you know, that's crap.

442
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,760
You know, because it's great to be able to use it for feedback.

443
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
But what does it mean, you know?

444
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Every single award or every single ranking

445
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
comes with an explanation.

446
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,760
I must say it's, I don't think it's right that iTunes

447
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
doesn't at least explain how it works.

448
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,760
That would be nice if they had some kind of a

449
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,760
fact about that, some fact document.

450
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,760
And to witness who about the taxes

451
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
levied on blank media,

452
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,760
I was incorrect about what I said about Australia.

453
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Mark Zeta corrects me.

454
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Adam just a correction on the last episode.

455
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Australia does not have an iPod tax at the moment.

456
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,160
Some parliament MPs tried to pass a similar

457
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,760
levied for blank media to cover piracy.

458
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,760
But as far as I know, the Australian Senate did not pass this bill.

459
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Ironically, our equivalent of the RIA, the ARIA, the ARIA,

460
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,760
discouraged the idea of a tax levied on blank media and MP3 players.

461
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,760
So yeah, luckily the ARIA does care about

462
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
our rights as a consumer.

463
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,760
So the whole point here, and I talked to a couple

464
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
people about it some more today.

465
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I said, you know, how in the world it's going to be legal.

466
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Let's just look at the states.

467
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Or it can't be legal for only the RIA to take money

468
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,760
from that levied or from those taxes.

469
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
It just can't be.

470
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
I mean, anyone who produces look,

471
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,760
but I have, I'm doing something creative.

472
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,760
It has a defined value.

473
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,760
It's the same format.

474
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,760
It is actually more of the same format than most songs.

475
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,760
So why wouldn't podcasters be allowed to get

476
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
some of that money?

477
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
I mean, come on.

478
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
And by the way, I'm very serious about this question.

479
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
That could be free money for us, you know,

480
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,760
and then we all register with some organization.

481
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,760
And then we get money from every blank CD or blank,

482
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
or iPod or whatever taxes will be levied on.

483
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
But certainly on certainly on CDs.

484
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,760
There are plenty of examples and lots and lots of proof

485
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,760
that people burn podcasts to CDs.

486
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,760
So you tell me what is the difference between someone burning a song

487
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760
to a CD and someone burning a copywriter work

488
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,760
and someone burning a podcast to a CD,

489
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
which is a copywriter work.

490
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
They're both in the same format.

491
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,760
They're both created by human beings with creative talent

492
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
with computers.

493
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Because one is a song.

494
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
They're allowed to get some of this money.

495
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
And because another one isn't a song.

496
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
You're not allowed to get that money.

497
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Come on, lawyers.

498
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
I know you're out there.

499
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Help me out on this.

500
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
This is highly interesting to me.

501
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
And if anything,

502
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,760
it'll be fun to figure it out if we can stir up some shit.

503
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Dig it.

504
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
All right.

505
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
One more song.

506
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Who are those bands?

507
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Don't forget where you came from.

508
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,760
I'm a little confused.

509
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,760
About all this enemy fire.

510
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,760
About drug loads and holy walls.

511
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,760
And people freaking out over what they want to freak about.

512
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Oh, so tired.

513
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,760
There's nothing on my radio.

514
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Some little girl who laughs and sleep below.

515
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
She tries to sing.

516
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,760
How she wants to dance on me.

517
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,760
I sometimes wonder what they came to me there.

518
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,760
It's unbelievable you came from.

519
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
No, I won't.

520
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,760
Don't forget where you came from.

521
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,760
Don't forget about all the people.

522
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,760
You left into your head.

523
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Did I never know?

524
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Did I never know?

525
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Did I never know?

526
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Did I never know?

527
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Did I never know?

528
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Did I never know?

529
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Did I never know?

530
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
Did I never know?

531
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Did I never know?

532
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Did I never know?

533
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
Did I never know?

534
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Did I never know?

535
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Did I never know?

536
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Did I never know?

537
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Did I never know?

538
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Did I never know?

539
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
Did I never know?

540
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Did I never know?

541
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Did I never know?

542
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Did I never know?

543
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Did I never know?

544
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Did I never know?

545
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Did I never know?

546
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Did I never know?

547
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Did I ever know?

548
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Did I never know about all the people?

549
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Did I never know?

550
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Did I never know?

551
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Did I never know?

552
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Did all of you came from?

553
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Did I never know?

554
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Did I never know?

555
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Did I never know?

556
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Did I never knew?

557
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Did I never know?

558
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Did I not know?

559
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Did I never know?

560
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Did I never knew?

561
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Did I never know?

562
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Did I never know?

563
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,760
When I think my girl got a call to shoot her time, go by, got a little too husk

564
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,760
You're blaming all I don't mind, yeah, I'm just easier, a little scarier

565
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Slow down, never going to burn it down, when the grass is green

566
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,760
You were so obscene, maybe your sight didn't look like mama

567
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,760
I won't walk, yeah, I don't want it

568
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Don't forget where you came from, no, I won't

569
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Don't forget where you came from

570
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,760
And don't forget about all the people

571
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,760
You left into your head, no

572
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,760
And don't forget where you came from

573
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Don't forget where you came from

574
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,760
And don't forget about all the people

575
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,760
You left into your head, no

576
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Cool water's band, don't forget where you came from

577
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
From the rose pedal to the metal CD

578
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,760
You can find it all on the pod safe music network at pod safe music network.com

579
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,760
Or if you prefer music.podshow.com

580
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,760
That's it for me, for the day of the source code, we back tomorrow

581
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,760
As I said, probably with the strategy cast, although we might delay that to the weekend

582
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,760
But definitely with a regular episode of the source code

583
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,760
Feedback, adamantcurry.com

584
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,760
And check out all the show notes of daily source code.com

585
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,760
I just gotta leave with this song one more time everybody. I'll see you tomorrow

586
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Take care now and feel free to sing along

587
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Silence like a sunshine day

588
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Take a look at how you normally be

589
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Never think everything is going my way

590
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,760
I show.com, makes no claims regarding the quality of its pod shows

591
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Or the sanity of its producers, listen at your own risk
