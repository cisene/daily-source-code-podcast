1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, everybody, I'm on British Airways flight 284 traveling from San Francisco to London.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I go to London. At the moment, I am completely flat on my back.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,700
Now, that's because I am in the club world class of British Airways service, which

4
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:59,700
I guess in quite a couple of years, they have a sleeper class service, which means that in the first class,

5
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:08,700
and then I guess this would be a business class where they call a club world, your seat can actually extend pretty much horizontally,

6
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,700
so that you can sleep. Well, of course, I can't sleep.

7
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,700
Because, well, for a number of reasons, hold on.

8
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,700
One.

9
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,700
I'm going to see this for a very long time.

10
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm recording now.

11
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Number one, the seat.

12
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,700
It's probably about six feet long, I guess, from head to toe and I'm six four.

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:44,700
So, kind of have to scrunch up, and it's not really, well, the first class is much better.

14
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,700
There you could a little mattress, and you could a little pajamas, and they tuck you in.

15
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,700
And it costs $8,000.

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,700
So, what that?

17
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Normally, I wouldn't even book myself in the club world, I'd book myself in the, what I call it,

18
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:14,700
they call it, the traveler plus class, which is coach, but with a little bit more room,

19
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,700
and it also gives you more flexibility if you want to rebook your flight, you can, you know, you can change stuff around.

20
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:29,700
But also, if you're in the traveler plus class, then you, it happened to me last time I was in San Francisco,

21
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,700
which was, well, it was watercolon, you know, member.

22
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Is there a room?

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,700
Was I?

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,700
I just can't remember.

25
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,700
When the last time was that I was flying around.

26
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Anyway, then you have a good chance that if the flight is oversold, then you get bumped up to,

27
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,700
uh, the club class.

28
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Another benefit, and this is something that is very specific to, uh, London to Heathrow,

29
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,700
is they, the concept of fast track.

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,700
So, you have customs, end to end airports security, by the way, on the way out,

31
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,700
but you have customs on the way in, basically, in the UK, the class system is alive and well,

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,700
because you could just bite by yourself, a faster way through customs.

33
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,700
And so, they give you a little pass, a pass track pass, looks like a boarding card.

34
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,700
And when you could off the plane, you go into the, really short line.

35
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,700
You don't have to stand in any long line.

36
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Oh, stupid.

37
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,700
You go right through, you kind of blow through customs.

38
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,700
And it wouldn't be surprised if my bag even comes off in a separate carousel.

39
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,700
So, I'm doing, I'm recording this on the creative labs, send micro that was given to me by folks

40
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
of Microsoft.

41
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,700
I talked about that on yesterday's source code.

42
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
I'm not even going to call this a source code.

43
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,700
I'm just going to throw it up there.

44
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Um, so they want to talk about a couple things.

45
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,700
First of all, what I want to talk about is this little device.

46
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
I'm pretty impressed.

47
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Um, wait, don't go away.

48
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
I'm going to check and see how this sounds.

49
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
And if it's recording, okay.

50
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,700
So, stay right where you are.

51
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
It'll take a nanosecond.

52
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Okay, cool.

53
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
It actually works.

54
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
And not bad.

55
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,700
I have to say I'm just talking right into the top of this thing where the microphone is located.

56
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
And I have to say the quality is pretty good.

57
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I'm pretty sure it's not an MP3 that it's recording to.

58
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,700
But I found, I was pointed to some max software for the Zen micro.

59
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Got that three email after talking about it, which I was very thankful for because, of course,

60
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,700
when I plugged it into my USB port, nothing showed up.

61
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,700
Nothing happened in the mountains drive.

62
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,700
And so now I have kind of the the manager of the iTunes, if you will,

63
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,700
of the Zen micro so that I can manage the files.

64
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,700
And it plays, you know, all the usual suspects.

65
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,700
The Zen micro XMP3 wave windows media.

66
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,700
And it's kind of funny.

67
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
It's the interfaces.

68
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,700
And you can see that they've tried to emulate a lot of the iPod.

69
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Sort of the click wheel you've got a thumb slide, I guess.

70
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,700
But they have been some things.

71
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,700
I think better just, you know, more thought out as to how you actually

72
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,700
find tracks.

73
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,700
They're still talking about music and artists and all that.

74
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
You know, she's unfortunate.

75
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Not the whole MP3 ID3 tag thing that will just be stuck with for generations of devices to come.

76
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,700
I'm sure.

77
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Don't know how the battery holds out what the charge is.

78
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
So far so good.

79
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,700
It's really, it's pretty stylish.

80
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Although I got in the really ugly color.

81
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,700
I like a yellowish green.

82
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,700
But the back of it is white.

83
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Very much iPod white.

84
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,700
In fact, the same kind of high gloss.

85
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,700
Very chic kind of expensive feel to it.

86
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Really like the fact there's an on-off button on that you can actually turn it on, turn it off.

87
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,700
And yeah, some of the menuing is is very interesting.

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,700
And upon recommendation from several people, I have not upgraded the firmware.

89
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,700
I don't know if I can upgrade the firmware with the Mac management software that I was given.

90
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
But as a matter, so far so good.

91
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
I'm liking it.

92
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
And I'm quite impressed with the voice recorder.

93
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
There's no settings.

94
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,700
I can't set it to the quality or the bit rate.

95
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I have no idea what the sample rate is.

96
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
But it sounds pretty good.

97
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,700
And again, these headphones are a little up and up.

98
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
That reminds me.

99
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Thank you all so much for sending me.

100
00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:01,700
And I must have received 50 or 60 emails about my question about headphones,

101
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:08,700
about the asymmetrical headphone wires on my Sony headphones.

102
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Well, it turns out I must be pretty dense.

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,700
I never even thought about what that was really intended for.

104
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,700
It's so that you could put the wire to your other ear behind your neck.

105
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:28,700
So you have the wire running down one side of your head.

106
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,700
I guess the left-hand side of this case.

107
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,700
So that's the short end of the wire with a short wire with the earbud.

108
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,700
And then the long one goes from the back ear neck in the other ear.

109
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,700
And I guess that would be the secret security kind of look.

110
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,700
And the reason why I never thought about it is because headphones for me

111
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,700
have always been a tool.

112
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,700
It's something that I've used on while recording or while doing radio shows.

113
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,700
And I've always had the symmetrical ones that kind of run right down the center of your chest

114
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,700
and up to each ear.

115
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,700
And it's kind of like it's a tool for me and it's my armor.

116
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,700
It's my uniform when you're doing a radio show.

117
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,700
So I never thought the height that because you don't.

118
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,700
And in fact, why would you?

119
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Anyway, but now I also understand how to use my head set that came with my Sony phone.

120
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Because it has the same asymmetrical headset.

121
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,700
It's funny how you think you're pretty smart and you just can't figure that out.

122
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,700
And then you would have to do with, I figured it had to do with different lengths.

123
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,700
You know, or do it.

124
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
And I couldn't figure it out.

125
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
There you go.

126
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,700
I don't know, I know, thank you.

127
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,700
It's kind of weird the lights are out in the plane.

128
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Everyone's asleep or they're pretending to be asleep.

129
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,700
And the way it's set up, I don't know if you ever seen one of these.

130
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,700
These sleepers seat classes.

131
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
So I'm actually traveling backwards.

132
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,700
My head is towards the nose of the plane.

133
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,700
My feet are pointing towards the tail.

134
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,700
On the way ahead, actually I'm traveling in the right direction.

135
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,700
But if I sit up, then I'm sitting with my back to the nose of the plane.

136
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Actually sitting down or lying down doesn't really all that strange.

137
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Next to me, with the screen in between, which I can pull down if I want.

138
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,700
That would be if I was traveling with the nice lady next to me.

139
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
But I'm not so the screen is up.

140
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,700
And she is, as you heard, it's over feet.

141
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Basically, if I could see them are where my head is.

142
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,700
And of course, she has the joy of my feet where her head is.

143
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
So it's dark.

144
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,700
The shades are down because let me see right now.

145
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,700
It's 625 AM UK time.

146
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,700
So we probably have about 4 or more hours to fly.

147
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,700
And of course, we're flying towards the light.

148
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
So all the window shades are down.

149
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,700
So that might actually I can check it for a second.

150
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
No. Oh wow.

151
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
The moon is beautiful.

152
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Wow, a couple of stars.

153
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
That's actually really nice.

154
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
I'm all going to get my glasses.

155
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
Because it's blurry.

156
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
I want to take a look at the moon.

157
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh, man.

158
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,700
It's not really comfortable.

159
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Just turn around.

160
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Look at glasses.

161
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,700
By the way, many people who met me, of course,

162
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,700
the past 10 days have been traveling.

163
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Some of them seem to not only impression that the rose-coloured glass

164
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,700
as I wear are a fashion statement.

165
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,700
While that may be true, they are glasses that I need to see better with.

166
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,700
We are just a beautiful.

167
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I've actually never paid any attention to this.

168
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
It's up in this stratosphere.

169
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Of course, there are probably 40, I'd say 42,000 feet.

170
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,700
Just in space, man.

171
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,700
The moon is so bright.

172
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
It's beautiful.

173
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Absolutely beautiful.

174
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Okay. You know, pull the shade down now.

175
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
There we go.

176
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,700
The rose-coloured glass is where Patricia's idea.

177
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,700
She said, you know, it was actually an inappropriate.

178
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,700
We were still in Belgium.

179
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:04,700
And there was all kinds of crap going on in my professional life or business life,

180
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,700
I guess, with lawsuits and bogus partnerships and stuff like that.

181
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,700
And yeah, I get depressed pretty easily, I guess.

182
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,700
But I'm not like pros act depressed or anything like that.

183
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Just bummed out.

184
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,700
She said, well, why don't you try some rose-coloured glasses

185
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,700
because the world will look that much nicer.

186
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
And you know what?

187
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
She's right.

188
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
The world does look nice to these glasses.

189
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,700
But at the same time, I really do need them to see it.

190
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,700
And I stop wearing contact lenses.

191
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,700
I used to wear contacts all the time.

192
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,700
And even though they're painted in the ass,

193
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,700
it's pretty easy just to have.

194
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,700
You know, not have to worry about not seeing stuff.

195
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,700
You can't find her glasses, but contacts are painted in the ass.

196
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,700
You know, keeping him in, taking him out,

197
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,700
you have the extended wear, the throwaway kind.

198
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,700
But it wasn't until I was offered a new pair of glasses.

199
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
And I tried them out.

200
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,700
And I went flying with them that I said, well, wait a minute.

201
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,700
I'm pretty sure that I see everything just a little bit better

202
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,700
with the glasses as opposed to contact lenses.

203
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
And when you're flying, it's pretty important.

204
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,700
So I started to pay attention to the difference.

205
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,700
And it's a big difference reading from computer screens.

206
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,700
It's just contact lenses. It's cool.

207
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,700
You know, the whole idea is all right.

208
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,700
But the technology is, in my mind, it's still not there.

209
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
It is absolutely not on par with glasses.

210
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Now, that being said, I would love to have my eyes laser.

211
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,700
Because that seems to be a pretty good fix.

212
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,700
But there's still an issue with FAA pilots license.

213
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,700
If you have your eyes laser, I think there's,

214
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,700
it's either two or five years that they hassle you about your medical

215
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
requirements in your license.

216
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Instead of really getting into all that shit and trying to figure it out.

217
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
And by the way, in aviation regulations.

218
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,700
No, it's hard for someone to give you a fucking straight answer sometimes.

219
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Because it could be, yes, it could work that way.

220
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
In the US on your FAA license, but maybe in other countries,

221
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,700
you'd have to adhere to the joint aviation regulations,

222
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,700
which have different set of rules and standards through that.

223
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
I'm wearing the glasses.

224
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,700
And I'm wearing the rose-colored ones to do.

225
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Where was I?

226
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Oh, yeah.

227
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:56,700
So I watched the movie Kinsey with Liam Neeson on the Inflite Entertainment.

228
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Oh, since we've got that, that was so stupid.

229
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
And I don't know if you've heard about this movie,

230
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
or if you know what it's about.

231
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,700
I, of course, in my life, had heard about the infamous,

232
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,700
or the famous really Kinsey report.

233
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,700
I had about it for my mom and my dad.

234
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
I remember them talking about it, or I'd quared them about it.

235
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
And I'd read about it, or heard about it.

236
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,700
And it was this series of studies, and it turns out,

237
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:28,700
the books that came out in the 50s, about human sexuality.

238
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,700
And it's by this guy named Kinsey, who was a biologist,

239
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,700
who studied insects, and, you know, in a time where,

240
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,700
actually, you know, if the times of change are not really,

241
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
I mean, you think about it.

242
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,700
In a time where sexuality was not discussed at all,

243
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,700
you know, there was no sex education in schools.

244
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,700
In fact, sex with or without,

245
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,700
another human being was discouraged, was deemed bad,

246
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
could make you go blind.

247
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,700
And what I like about this movie is they certainly did not pin these,

248
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,700
these thoughts that, that were the thought of the day.

249
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
They didn't pin them on the church or religion,

250
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,700
although I'm sure that has probably had a lot to do with it.

251
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,700
And it, kind of say, was kind of confusing because

252
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,700
you're looking at this movie, and I'm aware that it's a movie,

253
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
and it's a story, right?

254
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,700
It's a bio picture, it's about a real story, a real guy,

255
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,700
and real events that took place that were very well documented.

256
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,700
But it doesn't really translate to movie,

257
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,700
because although this is kind of the perverse part about it,

258
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,700
the movie was, of course, sanitized for my protection,

259
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,700
probably to get it be our rating that it needed to make any money back.

260
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,700
So, yeah, you see, like, you know, some,

261
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,700
some incredibly shocking pictures, and not suitable for children of

262
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,700
human body parts, like penises and vaginas,

263
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,700
and men kissing other men and adultery and debauchery.

264
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,700
But it was done very tastefully, and it was interesting how the

265
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,700
colors of the movie kind of went in and out from black and white to

266
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,700
color again, and I'd have to see it again to see it.

267
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,700
I think that some of the scenes of people having sex,

268
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,700
might have gone black and white at some parts.

269
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,700
I'm not quite sure, but the photography was actually very well done.

270
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:44,700
It just, like, really, well, I guess the point of the movie,

271
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,700
or the story, if anything, about Dr. Kinsey,

272
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,700
is that no two human beings are alike.

273
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,700
There is no normal when it comes to sexual,

274
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,700
desire, acts, thoughts,

275
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,700
because everyone has different feelings.

276
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Everyone wants different things.

277
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,700
And there was a sub-tone to the movie,

278
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,700
and I would say, let's see if I can articulate this,

279
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,700
basically that if you have a sexual desire,

280
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,700
which more than likely, if it's not straight up

281
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:42,700
down missionary with your wife or husband sex to procreate,

282
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
then that's going to be suppressed,

283
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,700
and it will become an obsession, which, of course,

284
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,700
is what makes people go fucking crazy.

285
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,700
And in thinking about that,

286
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,700
I'd just start to reflect on how weird society really is.

287
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
You know, when we think about, you know,

288
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,700
are you really gay or are you straight,

289
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,700
or are you bisexual, or, you know,

290
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,700
if they're a sliding scale, you put a number on it,

291
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,700
where does love come into play in sex?

292
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Can you measure love?

293
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Can you measure sexuality?

294
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Can you measure where you are on that scale?

295
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Very deep stuff to think about,

296
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,700
and then the hypocrisy of how you can,

297
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
and this was very well done in the movie,

298
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,700
of showing male breasts and nipples

299
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,700
is completely accepted by society.

300
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,700
But, you know, do I have to mention the Janet Jackson controversy?

301
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
You know, Marky Mark can,

302
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
I don't know why I came up with Marky Mark.

303
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Maybe because he has nice nipples.

304
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Marky Mark can do that.

305
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
What the hell?

306
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Mark will work.

307
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Okay, let's the bread pit, okay?

308
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Let's take bread pit.

309
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,700
But, you know, Janet Jackson

310
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
bearing a nipple for a nanosecond,

311
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,700
actually in a performance of art,

312
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
it's not only a huge issue,

313
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
but punishable by law,

314
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,700
and cost a lot of people a lot of money.

315
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:25,700
So, somehow all of this ties into what we're doing with this podcasting,

316
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,700
and I feel that there's another, you know,

317
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,700
it's got to be cyclical.

318
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,700
I mean, I think Patricia tells me often about the late 60s and the 70s,

319
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,700
and all the free love and just the vibe

320
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,700
that was going around back in the day.

321
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
She said, oh man, you would have loved it.

322
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
She says it was so much fun because, you know,

323
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
you could hang out with someone and say, hey,

324
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
I want to fuck you out.

325
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Okay.

326
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
No problem.

327
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Mail, female, whatever.

328
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
It was, and it was good.

329
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
It was accepted and people liked it.

330
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
And then it didn't necessarily have anything to do with drugs,

331
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,700
but that probably made it even that much nicer.

332
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,700
You know, a little bit of wine or a little bit of weed,

333
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
whatever.

334
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:12,700
And I have a feeling that because we've broken through this imaginary boundary

335
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,700
of what you can and can't say on the radio,

336
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
because let's face it folks.

337
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
This is radio.

338
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,700
It's just, you know, it's just not what we're used to calling radio,

339
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
but it is the, the actual,

340
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:32,700
it is the same act of transmitting sound from one person to the other.

341
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
So it's, let's call it radio communications,

342
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
even though there's no real radio waves involved,

343
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,700
but the broadcasting part is broadcasting.

344
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,700
And we're now able to do,

345
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,700
to communicate thoughts much better and use words that,

346
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,700
and feelings, and even even just this conversation that we're having now,

347
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
although it's kind of one way, but don't worry,

348
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
you'll all get back to me.

349
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Either the email or MP3, your feedback or whatever.

350
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,700
You know, this, this is something that just wouldn't have been possible.

351
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,700
Not that long ago.

352
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
So I think that we're going to see a lot,

353
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,700
and so as I was listening to Don and Drew,

354
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,700
with their, the last show from San Francisco.

355
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,700
And even though, you know, they kind of joke,

356
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
I mean, these are two people who love each other.

357
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
You can hear it.

358
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,700
And then they jokes sexual nature to each other all the time.

359
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,700
And it's just really beautiful somehow.

360
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,700
And then Madge, who is, I don't know if Madge is coming or going,

361
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
or what she is, but I don't care.

362
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,700
It was, it got caught off, unfortunately,

363
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,700
which was interviewing transsexual hores.

364
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,700
It didn't, in Miami.

365
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
And then there's,

366
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
Michael Butler, who in his own way.

367
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
Of course, you know, he's either rock or roll star.

368
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,700
He's an, he's an American hard break.

369
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,700
And he's got all his little groupy girls talking about that they love him.

370
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,700
And their boobs are, are, are the best boobs.

371
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
And they want to show him to him.

372
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
And, and then all of a sudden, one girl says,

373
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
but I'm a virgin.

374
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
I mean, it's just, it's crazy.

375
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
And then the list of these biddies.

376
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,700
And the, well, there you go, even the title of their,

377
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,700
of their van, the Sivias, go look it up.

378
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Lute in the Sivias.

379
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,700
It's probably in the, in the, in the law books somewhere.

380
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,700
It's great.

381
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:42,700
It's great to, and even though it's not about talking about sex or sexuality,

382
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,700
you can tell the, just the liberated feeling of everyone not having to worry about it.

383
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
And when it's audio,

384
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,700
you don't feel so conscious about, you know,

385
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,700
when you're saying something or talking about something,

386
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,700
how you look or where people, you know, when,

387
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,700
when, you know, when someone's looking at you basically.

388
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
What was that?

389
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Some thought that someone rolled out a bed here.

390
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
It was kind of cool.

391
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,700
I can see the lady next to me sleeping.

392
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,700
All right.

393
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
She's not that cute.

394
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,700
Let me see how many minutes it's been recording here.

395
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,700
There we are.

396
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Wow, 20 minutes away.

397
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Holy moly, that's pretty cool.

398
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
So, I don't, there's not really a point.

399
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,700
So what I'm saying here, but I,

400
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,700
I was just, I couldn't, I couldn't get back to sleep after seeing that movie.

401
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,700
It was just, wow, you know, what happened to us?

402
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,700
And of course, it's more, you know,

403
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,700
did we ever really get out of this,

404
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,700
this thing about, you know, body parts and,

405
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,700
and, and, yeah, just nature.

406
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,700
And how, how twisted it all is that, you know,

407
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
now I think many of you were podcasting,

408
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,700
understand why, well, maybe, maybe,

409
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,700
I hope it's as liberating for you as it is for me.

410
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Have you been a broadcaster for half my life,

411
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:32,700
and, you know, not being able to ever, ever express

412
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,700
myself fully because, you know,

413
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,700
that would be too real, if you, if you're real,

414
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
you're going to be indecent.

415
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
That's just no two ways about it.

416
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
You know, I get email from people saying,

417
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,700
you know, could you please stop with all the afterwards and the asswords?

418
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,700
And, you know, I point, point taken, you know,

419
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,700
sometimes to go overboard, but I just forget, you know,

420
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,700
and, in fact, I find myself catching myself in public places,

421
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,700
you know, so used to being free to be able to talk on the podcast

422
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,700
anyway, I want to, that I'm in restaurants and, you know,

423
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,700
saying shit, fuck, piss, whatever,

424
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,700
and I forget that, not everyone really digs that.

425
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,700
And of course, my voice is sometimes loud,

426
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,700
so I get some interesting looks.

427
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:31,700
I don't want to, you know, I don't want anyone to get mad at me.

428
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Can you tell it six a.m.?

429
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
And I'm kind of rambling.

430
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
I'll shut up in a minute.

431
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,700
So anyway, interesting movie,

432
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
if you can catch it, do,

433
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,700
but maybe look up the Kinsey report

434
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
and look up the history of Dr. Kinsey

435
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,700
and look at some of the results of that report

436
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,700
and see, you know,

437
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,700
maybe draw some conclusions about society.

438
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,700
I certainly need to be a little bit less fucked up.

439
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,700
That's for sure, because it's just weird.

440
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Things that are permissible,

441
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
of things that aren't permissible,

442
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,700
and I think that women totally get an unfair shake in this deal.

443
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,700
Certainly in the United States, certainly, certainly.

444
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
Okay.

445
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,700
So that was all really.

446
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,700
At a great time in the States,

447
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
really enjoyed

448
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,700
hooking up with old friends,

449
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
acquaintances,

450
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,700
new friends, possibly with new business partners

451
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,700
and people who are doing exciting things.

452
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,700
And I think that there will be some fun stuff

453
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
to report in the coming weeks.

454
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Some fun things that will be happening.

455
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,700
I heard a lot of interesting projects

456
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
from many different people.

457
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Remember, no damn announcements out of me.

458
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,700
Thanks, everybody.

459
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,700
I'll talk to you on probably on Monday

460
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
with a regular daily source code.

461
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,700
So, from 42,000 feet

462
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,700
with my feet extended out,

463
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,700
it's Adam Curry saying bye-bye.

464
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,700
I'm telling you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

465
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm telling you, I'm sorry.
