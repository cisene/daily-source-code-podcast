1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,740
Hi everybody, it's the Daily Source Code for what are we now at? Wednesday, at least this

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:20,180
will air, that is air in quotation marks on April the 13th, 2005. I'm in my hotel room

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:28,460
at the Waldorf Astoria in New York and it is now quarter past 10 in the evening. Another

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,460
stellar day here in the city, I've got to say the energy of this place is just so amazing.

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,840
It's good to be back in New York. I almost want to say a great place to visit, but you

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,360
wouldn't want to live here, but I wouldn't mind living here again. It's, it's, uh, man,

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,720
everybody. So energetic, the streets are just filled with people who want to get shit done

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,480
and are going somewhere and are doing things and everybody's gone an angle, which is

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:04,240
always nice. Um, oh, second. I'm, uh, on the I River set up right now with the wireless

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:12,240
microphone set. And I was thinking, what could I do for a podcast? I'm in the bathroom

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,520
right now. You can probably tell the difference in acoustics. Um, so for those of you who

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,920
are new to the source code and new to the sound seeing tour scene, uh, my set up is a wireless

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,480
microphone set. I've got the, uh, the lavalier microphone on. And I've got the, uh, the transmitter,

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,600
uh, pack on my belt. And I've got the receiver. Actually, it's in my left hand right

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,920
now. Uh, the receiver goes straight into the lining, put of the I River. And, uh, this

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,520
is what I've used many times. You can, it's almost like a phone call. When I'm on the

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,120
phone, I'm, I'm one of those people who likes to pace around and walk while I talk.

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,760
I wonder what, I'm sure there's someone out there, some psychologists who can explain why

19
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:05,920
some people like to do that. Anyway, um, one of, uh, our bokeh associates, uh, stayed over

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,920
an extra night here in New York, he's from D.C. Brian. Uh, and, um, his laptop broke. So I've

21
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,600
given him the, the tablet. So he can use that to do email and spreadsheets and God knows what

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,320
he wants to do with it. Download porn. It can just open up my hard drive. So, um, I don't have

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,400
all my, uh, all my jingles and sweepers and all that stuff all lined up and, uh, and all the promos.

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,040
So if you're going to do something a little different for tonight, um, also, we had such a long day.

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,040
It started with an 815 breakfast meeting. Man, I haven't done one of those in years. It was

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,440
royalty hotel. I don't know if you know it in New York, but it was great to start off, you know,

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,000
power breakfast and then meeting the meeting, the meeting, the cab to meeting and met a whole

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,520
bunch of great people, lots of people very enthusiastic about podcasting in, uh, in New York.

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,360
And of course, uh, as I've explained before, you know, we're, we're Madison Avenue, uh, the

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,400
generates. So we've been meeting lots of advertisers and people who are interested in what they

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:18,880
can do with podcasting. Um, so I thought that what we do is we do a sound scene to

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:28,880
the hotel and actually it wants to do an elevator cast. Um, elevators are interesting. You know,

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,520
usually people look at the numbers, right? Look at the floor of the run as it counts down or counts

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,880
up. And, uh, if there's more, you know, if people come in in a group, they'll talk amongst themselves,

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,600
but lots of times it's just silence and all kinds of different things. And if you really are

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,800
listening to what's happening, um, you can hear interesting stuff. So I figured what we do

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,960
for the next 30 minutes or so. Also, we just had a great dinner, um, at, uh, home and I brought a

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,960
card with me from the restaurant. Let me just grab that from my back pocket. Where do we have

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:10,000
dinner? Bellini, which is on 208 East 52nd Street was just phenomenal. And, uh, Ron, who keeps saying,

40
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,320
he's not snobbished about wine, but he is, uh, ordered a fantastic Italian red wine. And I'm not

41
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,760
a drinker at all. I think most people know, uh, who listen to this show that, uh, I like to smoke my

42
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:30,160
poisons. Uh, so I'm, uh, I'm a little slow in the speech. So I think what we do is we'd, uh,

43
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,440
run the hallways a little bit, um, ride the elevator for maybe a half hour and, uh, see what we bump

44
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,480
into. And if that's too boring, we'll go into lobby. And we'll just see if we can, uh, get some nice

45
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,360
sounds from the lovely Waldorf, a story in New York City. So let me get everything prepared here.

46
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:57,920
First of all, me do that. Okay. Now I'm going to remove the headset. There we go. So now I can't

47
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,240
hear myself. I'm just making sure that I river is in the lock position. So nothing goes wrong.

48
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,480
I'm going to do it. I'm going to put the receiver. Actually, I'll put the receiver

49
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,600
and I river into my, hold on. Let me not put it in my left pocket. That's where the cell phone is.

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,640
In case I need to talk and there are people around, I will just grab the cell phone real quick.

51
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,520
Okay. Carefully slipping the I river into my pocket as well. Okay.

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:36,640
There we go. Now I'm going to note the time. So 10, 21. So let's say it's 10, 22. So I started

53
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:46,640
10, 20. So we'll go until at least 10 minutes to 11. And I hope you enjoy the, the sound scene

54
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,040
tour and the elevator cast of the Waldorf story. Let's see what we come up against. Let's see if

55
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,480
we can get any conversations. See if we actually all grab the phone as I walk out the door here.

56
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:06,240
So I, this is our, this is what we do when we actually heard magic do it the other day when

57
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:14,240
she did a cast of a target. You do feel a little bit self-conscious when you're doing this.

58
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,200
So I'm on the 15th floor and walked out of my room and just heard the door close.

59
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,760
I'm going to left here past the ice machine and we're going to go on the elevator and let's just see.

60
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,440
There's usually a lot of people going up to their room at this point. The American paper

61
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,400
and forest association is holding a conference in the hotel. So maybe we'll hear some interesting

62
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:50,880
conversation about paper. So hang right towards the elevators and the minute there are people in

63
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:59,120
the elevator. I'll stop talking and while I'm alone again with you guys we'll talk again.

64
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:08,560
So here we are. Getting into the elevator down to the lobby. Hopefully we'll pop up against somebody

65
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:20,800
12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. I'll have to get off when we hit the lobby.

66
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,480
Otherwise people think a very strange just riding the elevator up and down.

67
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,480
Okay. So a very fast elevator.

68
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,080
I'm walking to the lobby for a second here.

69
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,240
We're now in the lobby of the Waldorf. That's why I'm behind these guys.

70
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,960
This will be fun. Let's see if we can follow their conversation. Bear with me now.

71
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:17,440
We leave them by. We lost Chuckie too. Okay, so unfortunately for those guys weren't going

72
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,760
up in the elevator. So we'll just wait here. Some people are going to ride up.

73
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
There's a guy in the phone. Let's follow him.

74
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,160
I don't have a car for you. I've got a couple of essentials.

75
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,800
Cell phone. What else? Toothbrush. What else do you need, right? You with the paper guys?

76
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,520
Is that me? Good night.

77
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,520
Okay. When we started with the conversation, actually this elevator is a little bit too fast.

78
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,520
Okay, I take it up to 15 and then we'll have no one's there. We'll go down again.

79
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,840
No, he didn't. He didn't. No, he doesn't hit. Okay, El. There you go.

80
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,520
14, we're stopping. Let's see if someone jumps on.

81
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,160
It caused briefly and just kept on going down. Man, learning a lot about the elevator here at the

82
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Waldorf. Okay, it looks like we're going all the way down to the lobby. So, good try.

83
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:52,080
And we're back down in the lobby.

84
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,840
Okay, we're going to follow these people back on the elevator. See where they're from.

85
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,760
Yeah,

86
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
I, dude, but I was there a little bit a little bit.

87
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Good night, floor.

88
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Good night.

89
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Okay, they weren't very talkative.

90
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Guess what? We're going back out to 15.

91
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm getting dizzy already from this riding the elevator stuff.

92
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Hi, sir. Going down?

93
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
It's busy tonight, huh?

94
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Yeah.

95
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Every day, the board office is always busy.

96
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
It's crazy.

97
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,160
There's a lot of people from outside the country, just out of town.

98
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,160
Yeah, over, yeah, there were competitions, yeah, beer,

99
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
on the time of your competitions.

100
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
The American Forests and Paper People?

101
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Yeah, Paper People. They're living tomorrow.

102
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Are they nice? The Paper People?

103
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
No, I'm nice.

104
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm not.

105
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
It's lovely, sir.

106
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Thank you very much. Good night.

107
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:07,160
So I'm here in the lobby.

108
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,160
I'm just going to stand here for a couple of minutes and see if we bump into

109
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
another group that we can follow in.

110
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,160
I just kind of wind no shop.

111
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,160
I see three light expensor shops here in the Waldorf.

112
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,160
You want some bling, man? This is the place to come for your bling.

113
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Some of the conversations are just absolutely hilarious when we listen to them.

114
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,160
So just to throw everybody off track,

115
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,160
we're going to walk across the lobby for a second.

116
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
And then we'll walk back and see if we can find another group of people to

117
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,160
ride up with. Again, see if we can strike up conversation.

118
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,160
I'm noticing that the elevators here are extremely fast,

119
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,160
which makes it a little difficult to talk for too long.

120
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,160
But there's also a couple other elevator banks.

121
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Maybe I'll try some of the other ones.

122
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,160
I could also hang out in the bar, but I really want to try and

123
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,160
keep it going with the elevators.

124
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,160
By the way, in the hallway here at the Waldorf, this is beautiful.

125
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,160
It reminds me of home actually, it's a Louis Cutters table with beautiful flower

126
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,160
arrangement that they cut fresh today.

127
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Look at this, there's a whole movie crew here.

128
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,160
I wonder what the film is.

129
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
See if we can figure that out.

130
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Looks like a 16-millimeter set up.

131
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,160
So now I'm at the Park Avenue entrance.

132
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:16,160
It's a ladies who are dressed beautifully, like Game Outfits.

133
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,160
They're a security guard or a cop in the lobby talking a couple of people.

134
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Nice piano in the background.

135
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,160
And it seems like everybody's on their cell phone here.

136
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Which, of course, could mean, hey, what's this?

137
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
WB extras holding.

138
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Maybe we're doing some kind of audition for the WB or for Warner Bros.

139
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,160
But it's just walking here and see what we can do to find out.

140
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,160
This is some kind of audition statement, but it's...

141
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Oh, this is that one.

142
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,160
It's definitely a cattle call.

143
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Oh, they're doing some kind of play.

144
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,160
And then it would be at the...

145
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Mm-hmm.

146
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Yes, they are on the end of the...

147
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
There we go.

148
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Are these auditions?

149
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,160
No, they're picking photos now, but people are really on this.

150
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
No, no.

151
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
And the hotel just curious, nosy.

152
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:38,160
No, this is photographing here and we're doing a background for a movie or a TV pilot.

153
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Really?

154
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Do you know what the name of the pilot is called?

155
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Really?

156
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Do you win it?

157
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Yes.

158
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Okay.

159
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
And then it would be exciting.

160
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Well, I don't know, it's late.

161
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Great.

162
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
It should be exciting.

163
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Look, look.

164
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Look, look, look.

165
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Look, look, look, look, look.

166
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Are you a principal?

167
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
No.

168
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm Adam.

169
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm dear, friends.

170
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
I'm dear.

171
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Yes.

172
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Do you have friends?

173
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
So where are you?

174
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Yeah.

175
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm a business here in the city from London.

176
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Can you tell me my accent?

177
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
No.

178
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Yeah.

179
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Interesting.

180
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,160
The friends say, but it's for the W'd be?

181
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Yes.

182
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
All right.

183
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Tell me the B.

184
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
What do you apply?

185
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I'm playing a party girl.

186
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Really?

187
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Okay.

188
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
You have lines?

189
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
No.

190
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Oh, that sucks.

191
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I know.

192
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
You got a card?

193
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Are you a bag?

194
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Yeah?

195
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Yeah.

196
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
I'm normally pretty full and bust.

197
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Mm-hmm.

198
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Yeah.

199
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I was not working.

200
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
I just got back to Las Vegas.

201
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
I decided to go.

202
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Working in Vegas or a party.

203
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Yeah, actually.

204
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
I actually did a little bit of both.

205
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
There isn't that working.

206
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Was it the celebrity program in Bravo?

207
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Sure.

208
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
And, um, oh, yeah.

209
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
How are you?

210
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I'm my friend, Richard Bells.

211
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
You're a small child.

212
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
I'm fine.

213
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I'm fine.

214
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Right.

215
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
He plays for a picture?

216
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Yeah, of course.

217
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Anyone plays for a picture?

218
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Yeah, of course.

219
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Anyone plays for a picture?

220
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Right.

221
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Yeah.

222
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Cool.

223
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Who is for Julio?

224
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
That's good.

225
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
That's good.

226
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
No.

227
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
No.

228
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
No.

229
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
And.

230
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Did well.

231
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
And.

232
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
You've met with a lot of other people in the business.

233
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
He was really good.

234
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
So the business was not.

235
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
That's not.

236
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Yeah.

237
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Sorry.

238
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
You can combine it.

239
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
It was always nice.

240
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Exactly.

241
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
What have we discussed?

242
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
It's a miracle of my technology.

243
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Hi.

244
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Good.

245
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Fine.

246
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Thank you for welcoming me.

247
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Hold it.

248
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
I know.

249
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
It's your card.

250
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Me to get up.

251
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
It's not good.

252
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
I know.

253
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Birthday girl having to get out.

254
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
I feel good.

255
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I feel good.

256
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I feel like.

257
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
You know.

258
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
You know.

259
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
You know.

260
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
You know.

261
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
You know.

262
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Yeah.

263
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
You know.

264
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
You know.

265
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
To which cake.

266
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,200
No, not enough stuff.

267
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Substance.

268
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
And if it's put it on.

269
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,160
I'll be back.

270
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Mm hmm.

271
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
So I'm just.

272
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
You can go.

273
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
I'll bring up your dinner.

274
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I'm going to be.

275
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
You can go.

276
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
So I'll bring up your dinner.

277
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
I'll give up.

278
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I'll give up.

279
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Yeah.

280
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I'll be back.

281
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
I'll be back.

282
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Thank you.

283
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Okay.

284
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
That's it.

285
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
So.

286
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
All right.

287
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
So I'm back up.

288
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
I'm so.

289
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
I'm so.

290
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
But that was interesting.

291
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
So I clearly.

292
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,720
Clearly, it's an audition for extras and there must be only three, three, four, five, six.

293
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,760
There must be twenty people here standing in line to get the picture taken to be

294
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,760
extras in the pilot for the prince.

295
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Okay.

296
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:44,160
Say, what, I'm just going to walk out of here and see if we can go find some more people to talk to.

297
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:56,320
We could, of course, always talk to some of the extras, but they're boring me.

298
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,920
Welcome back into the lobby.

299
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,320
A little time check here, oh man, times flying, we've already been at it for about 15 minutes.

300
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,560
Let me just double check the eye river, make sure we're still recording.

301
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,880
Indeed, actually 19 minutes, so far, go to a lot faster than anything.

302
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:25,080
Really, the cell phone is just the best cover you could imagine.

303
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,600
So it was nice meeting, dear Dr, from back into the main lobby here.

304
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:55,240
So, people taking pictures of themselves and the lobby being from habitat on that's a big

305
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
deal.

306
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,800
You can take a lot of pictures myself.

307
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Okay, so, back in front of the salini window shops, okay, people are going up in the

308
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,340
middle of the pool boiling.

309
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:51,640
Good night!

310
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,120
No.

311
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,660
Good night!

312
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:06,700
Not recommended, but no.

313
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,320
I don't think you have a card tray for competition, could you give it to me?

314
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,060
Okay.

315
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Okay, so much for that ride.

316
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:28,060
I guess what I really should do is wait for, how you doing?

317
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
Hello.

318
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:37,060
I should really wait for like a group of people who are already talking to go up to make

319
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,060
a little bit more exciting so we can get some actual conversation

320
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,060
from the maids who just said hi to me.

321
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:53,060
So let's take another ride down and see if we can catch a group going up.

322
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,060
Here we go.

323
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Waiting for the Vader. These things are so fast.

324
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Okay.

325
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,060
Back down to the lobby.

326
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,060
I wonder how long it's going to take for some of the hotel staff to catch on and think

327
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,060
that I'm a freaking idiot. A Vader fetish.

328
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,060
That's what I've got.

329
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,060
Just love riding the animators.

330
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:26,060
So if you could beat you and kind of along the floors and other we have now arrived at the lobby again.

331
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,060
So here we go.

332
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:43,060
Okay. Back down to the lobby.

333
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,060
Walking the other way towards the lex...

334
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,060
I think it's lexing to have on the side of the lobby.

335
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
Let me see this.

336
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,060
Let me just check for you.

337
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
Yeah.

338
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Lexing to have new entrance.

339
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:12,060
Okay.

340
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,060
Okay. Let's follow these people up.

341
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
They seem to be talking.

342
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Listen to your cool.

343
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Just a hand by.

344
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,060
Okay.

345
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Follow the barrel.

346
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Follow the barrel.

347
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Okay.

348
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
Go down.

349
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
You're going to do it.

350
00:23:51,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Yeah.

351
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
So have a nice trip there.

352
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
See you next time.

353
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
You're going to go ahead and then tomorrow afternoon.

354
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Let's do it again.

355
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,060
Okay.

356
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,060
Okay.

357
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,060
Okay.

358
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,060
Okay.

359
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,060
Okay.

360
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,060
Okay.

361
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
Okay.

362
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,060
Okay.

363
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Okay.

364
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Okay.

365
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,060
Okay.

366
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,060
Okay.

367
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:46,060
What are you from?

368
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:53,060
Pointi, t-tea.

369
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,060
Can I..

370
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,060
Damn.

371
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,820
Damn, it really sucks.

372
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,820
The elevators just too fast.

373
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,820
I can't get a conversation going.

374
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:16,340
So, actually that guy got off on the same floor as I did on 15.

375
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,340
So, we'll ride it back down again.

376
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,100
Maybe we'll go back to the WB casting call

377
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,860
and see if we can strike up a conversation there.

378
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,060
Oh, man, static electricity in New York is nuts.

379
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Okay.

380
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
Back down to the lobby.

381
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,060
It's a big little old.

382
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,060
I wonder if there's a camera in this elevator

383
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,060
and they're registering me riding up and down

384
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,060
as a couple of guys in a security booth somewhere,

385
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
worrying about what the frick I'm doing.

386
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,060
Lobby, here we are.

387
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,060
Okay, back in the lobby.

388
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,060
And see, probably going to keep it going for another 10 minutes.

389
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:18,060
What I'll do is I'll wait by the lobby and then when, uh,

390
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,060
the next group of talkers comes through.

391
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,060
I'll just follow him up.

392
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:33,060
So, right now, walking behind the door.

393
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,060
I'll just follow him up.

394
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
So, right now, walking behind the door.

395
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,060
I'll just follow him up.

396
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,060
So, right now, walking behind the door.

397
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,060
So, right now, walking behind the door.

398
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,060
A couple of the women's beautiful gala dresses.

399
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,060
We're back out through past the flowers,

400
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,060
with the Louis-cut on top of the Louis-cut tour desks.

401
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Back in the central lobby.

402
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:25,060
Okay, standing here, uh, once again in front of the, uh,

403
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,060
the WB-extra's holding area.

404
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,060
All kinds of interesting people here at this time and night.

405
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,060
Okay, what should we do?

406
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,060
Should we walk into the holding area?

407
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:59,060
Or should we do another trip on the elevator?

408
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,060
What a horrible time to be doing on additions to being extra at, like,

409
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
quarter or another night.

410
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,060
That's pretty intense.

411
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,060
Everybody's on theirself, but let's just outrageous.

412
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:23,060
Okay.

413
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:33,060
Okay.

414
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,060
Okay, well, we're going to walk back through the lobby.

415
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:44,060
See if we can catch a, um, a group of people who are at least talking,

416
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,060
follow them, ride back up again.

417
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,060
I think I can only do this, we want it two more times,

418
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:57,060
and then we pretty much done the complete sounds seeing tour at the elevator cast.

419
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:11,060
Okay.

420
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Well, that was bogus.

421
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,060
I followed four women to the elevator, thought they were all together.

422
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,060
Three of them got off on the 11th floor, one stayed on until 14th.

423
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,060
I pressed 26, I have no idea where the heck I'm going.

424
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:11,060
So what I'll do is I'll get off here and then ride back down.

425
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:16,060
Okay, since there's no one here, I'll just hit the lobby in.

426
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,060
We'll go back down. This is a different elevator bank.

427
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,060
The bank that I mean doesn't go above 19, I think.

428
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
Hey, that's interesting.

429
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,060
I thought there was no 19th floor on this cab or this car.

430
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,060
What is it? Elevator cab? Elevator car? Elevator car, I guess.

431
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,060
Okay, back down to the lobby. We'll walk across the lobby again,

432
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:46,060
and we'll wait for the final ride up.

433
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,060
Got the cell phone to the ear once again.

434
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:58,060
They may just also be a little bit too late.

435
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Everyone's kind of retiring for the evening, either that or the just going out.

436
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:17,060
Nope, nothing going on.

437
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:22,060
Nobody and nothing. It's a baby crying in the background.

438
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,060
I think he's at way too late.

439
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,060
Pause here by the dresser.

440
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,060
I'll follow these people.

441
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,060
I'll follow these people.

442
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:53,060
You folks here with a convention?

443
00:31:53,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Yeah, we were.

444
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,060
Baker?

445
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,060
Broadcasting business.

446
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,060
Yeah, that wasn't me though.

447
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,060
You too, good night.

448
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,060
Oh, they were nice.

449
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,060
Well, I think that's just about it.

450
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,060
Didn't get too much trouble, didn't get to, you have to too many people.

451
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:38,060
Please, we got our money's worth out of the elevator.

452
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,060
So I'm back on the 15th floor.

453
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,060
Back to my room.

454
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,060
Yeah.

455
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:55,060
Okay, that was almost a pretty lame mistake that I may just there.

456
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:00,060
Talking to you guys and around the corner and someone can the other way.

457
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,060
That didn't mean like I was from freaking Mars.

458
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:14,060
Okay, so we're almost back at the room here.

459
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
Get my key.

460
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:20,060
So it's almost been exactly half an hour.

461
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,060
Okay.

462
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,060
Here we go.

463
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,060
All right.

464
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,060
Well, I hope I didn't bore you too much.

465
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,060
We didn't accomplish as much as I hope we would have.

466
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:38,060
We had a couple of conversations with him folks.

467
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:44,060
Tomorrow is a work day in the city.

468
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,060
We've got a conference room and a white board and some stuff.

469
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,060
So it won't be quite as intense as the past couple of days.

470
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,060
So I'll be able to do a quote unquote regular source code with promos.

471
00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:02,060
And actually, note I've mentioned that I'm staying here in the Waldorf people are

472
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:08,060
sending CDs up to the room and all kinds of interesting things that I can play on the show.

473
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,060
So that'll be for tomorrow.

474
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
Thanks everybody for tuning in.

475
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,060
