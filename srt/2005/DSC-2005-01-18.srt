1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
daily source code for Tuesday, January 18th, 2005.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,000
Transmeters, we don't need no stinkin' transmitters.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,440
Oh, I'm drowsing casting with Adam Curry.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,840
You coming to hear from the cottage?

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,240
The power of the door, the door, the door, the door, the door.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Hey, everyone.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
How you doing?

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,120
Welcome to the daily source code, as I said today is January 18th, it's Tuesday, 2005.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,480
That's the new thing we're doing now, it's help everyone queue up the new, uh, oops.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,480
That was interesting.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,480
You have the new, uh, source code just by the day to do a little tag at the beginning of the show.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Anyway, it's the power of pure intellect to work.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Although that intellect is not to be found at British Telecom, or easy nap today.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Currently, the time is 11 a.m. here at Curry Cottage in the,

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,480
affluent Surrey Suburb of Gilford in the UK, and, um,

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,480
I've been on the phone again this morning trying to get that last 15 meters of cable connected to the house here,

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,480
and boy, have a lot of fun not getting it done, right?

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,480
I'm pissed off about a lot of things today, so this should be a good show.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Look forward to sharing with you the next 40 minutes is your daily source code.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:28,480
You know, last night, um, I called, uh, I called a couple people in the states, uh,

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,480
a couple podcasters, actually I spoke to, uh, to Drew from, uh, Don and Drew show,

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,480
and he and I have been actually been exchanging emails with him with his lovely wife, Don,

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,480
threatening to call, and of course, they're so nice and so polite, they never call me, right?

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Um, and here's the problem that I run into. I don't know if anyone who lives over in Europe

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,480
and deals with, um, communicating with the states in real time from time to time.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Uh, probably has this, uh, the same issue is that by the time it's, you know,

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,480
you're going to call someone, like Drew gets off work at five o'clock, um,

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,480
mountain time, I guess there's a central, whatever, uh, which means that's 11 p.m. here in the UK.

29
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Well, it used to be midnight in, uh, in Belgium when, uh, when we're living in the castle.

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,480
And for, well, I mean, so the 11 p.m. is one thing, right, because it's kind of like the end of my day.

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm getting ready to go to bed. Um, yes, old and boring at 40, go to bed at 11. He leaven.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,480
He leaven, dammit. Um, but in my case, there's an extra handicap, because I'm usually pretty much

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,480
baked around 9 p.m. And then what happens is like, oh, man, I should call it.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,480
So I can should call Don Drew. I should, I want to talk to him, but then I'm just, oh, man,

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm not going to be coherent. I don't want to be saying, um, and actually a cop to that,

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,480
uh, to Drew yesterday and he said, oh, dude, I totally know what you talk about.

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,480
But you're talking about, so that's good. So I, so I feel like, uh, like,

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,480
people understand my pain. Um, but it really is, it truly is an issue. Um, the time difference,

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,480
even though it's only five hours, it's still it's more than you think. Anyway,

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,480
uh, lots of talk about today. I got a lot of feedback from yesterday's show.

41
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,480
The first thing is a glaring error that I made. Of course, it is not Jamie Far, uh,

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,480
who played Ray Charles in, uh, in the movie Ray, but Jamie Foxx. I did have in

43
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,480
living color correct. Uh, that's the show that he became, uh,

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,480
most famous, uh, or that he really broke through on, I guess. Um, and we watched the Golden Globes

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,480
last night, uh, it was a tape delay. And, uh, so it was like, was a three and a half

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,480
out. No, it nine to let that two and a half hour show. We watched it here on, uh,

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,480
I guess was on ITV, uh, boring. God, man, that's gotten so predictable and just

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,480
boring. Hmm. It's no wonder in the States, the show, uh,

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
the show got kicked in the in the ratings by Desperate Housewives. Come on,

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,480
don't you know, does you tell of his an executives? No, what people want?

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

52
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,480
um, there was some real sincerity, though, I like the way Jamie Foxx, uh,

53
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,480
accepted his award, uh, because apparently it wasn't independent film, uh,

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,480
some independent finance year pulled $35 million out of his pocket and said,

55
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,480
hey, let's go make this movie. And then it got picked up. I mean,

56
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
very much the way I see a lot of podcasts, uh, the way they will go,

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,480
at least for the foreseeable future because radio and television is not dead by a

58
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,480
long shot, my friends. But I do see that we'll have some podcasts,

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,640
casters who will break into the mainstream, more importantly probably is that we'll see some

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,760
music breaking into mainstream and getting a, quote, real recording contract. I'm looking

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,120
forward to helping a lot of people getting there. That's one of the missions that I'm taking

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,200
upon myself for the, for the next foreseeable future, which would probably be a part of any

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,040
commercial venture that, that I take part in, which would get in close to figuring someone

64
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,080
that stuff out. Although before any of that can be figured out, I have to get my freaking

65
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,720
broadband, okay? And yesterday, not a peep out of easy net or British telecom, no one called

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,040
me. I figured it give him one day after the weekend after I was, you know, doing the rounds

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,680
on Friday and easy net, Lee from easy net. I'm not going to use last names, but I'll certainly

68
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,840
use first names. Lee promised me, oh yeah, we'll keep you up the speed. Let you know what's going

69
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:19,480
on, fucking bullshit. Bullshit, okay? So today, I called up at 9 o'clock Lee who has been my

70
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,560
contact. There's no longer answering his phone. I figured that's because I have my caller ID on

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,400
and he just doesn't want to be bothered and he's there for, it's not going to voice Miller anything

72
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:35,800
it's just ringing and ringing and ringing. So I called the guy who sold me this wonderful service,

73
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,480
his name is Philip. Philip wasn't in, but I did get through to somebody and I've decided that I'm

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,000
going to record every single phone call with British telecom and with easy net and replay them here

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,520
for you so you can hear just how excellent and how helpful the friendly fucking services. Let's see

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,840
what this part is. This is, all right, I was just put on hold for a second with this guy was trying

77
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,880
to find Philip, the sales guy that originally sold me the easy net package. I'm not getting any

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,920
luck on his phone. I'm sending him an email that you called and came to get back in touch with you.

79
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,920
Well, maybe you can help me. I'm just really looking for anyone with an easy net to help me at this

80
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:21,560
point. My line was installed on January. Listen to the guy, he's going like, okay, he knows that

81
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,280
this is the shit call, right? He's going like, oh fuck, what if the pick of the goddamn phone,

82
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,200
I get the gas holes? Hey, I saw the like match for a second, didn't I? You know what? That's it.

83
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,800
Yeah, I got a real threat for you in mind. Hold on, let's listen to the rest of this call.

84
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:46,040
May the fourth. Yeah. And apparently British telecom neglected to connect the curb to the new wiring

85
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,680
in the house. And I've literally been trying for two weeks to get anyone to complete this job and I'm

86
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,360
not getting a lot of love from using it. That's for sure. Yeah. And I need someone to escalate

87
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,880
this somewhere to get this going because it's now been two weeks that the line is literally

88
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,120
disconnected by 15 meters of wire. Yeah. Okay. Well, what's your company name there? I don't know.

89
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,280
Okay. So, you know, now it's like, he should have asked me what my company name was. The minute

90
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,560
before you even try to get the sales guy. But okay, I'll let him slide on this. So, of course,

91
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,760
I have a great company name, right? I look on Polder. Okay. Seven minutes.

92
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:34,040
Silicon Polder, you ask? Polder, POL, DER. Okay. Now listen to this.

93
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,080
Right. He's looking at the file now. He's going, oh fuck. This is the, this is the trouble case.

94
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,960
I want to bounce this one away from you as soon as possible.

95
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,400
I can give you the number of the provisioning department.

96
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,360
Oh, that's not going to do it for me today. I've been through all the provisioning departments.

97
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,280
They're all saying it's British telecoms fault. So, I think it'll come right back to sales.

98
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,120
The people who sold it to me. I've been around this loop multiple times. He's with me through

99
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,960
the provisioning now. Oh, no. Not going to work. Because I would assume that would be the best

100
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,240
assessment that does that. I want to respond to people for it. I don't know what they're saying

101
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,640
is they're not responsible. British telecom is responsible and they hope it'll happen soon.

102
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,360
But at this point, my business is severely suffering. Now, you see, I'm sliding in a little

103
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,840
something here, which is true, right? Because remember, I am an asshole American. We love to

104
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:35,720
litigate the fuck out of people. Oh, I'm really getting, I'm, you know, how about emotional distress?

105
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:43,880
My marriage is under actual strain here. BT, eating net fuckers. And it's past all promise dates.

106
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:51,240
And there were a lot of promises when I signed up. And, you know, what needs to happen is

107
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,240
eating that needs to talk to BT, which as far as I understand is a commercial company. And tell

108
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,080
them that they are out of line and need to get this done today. I mean, literally out of line,

109
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,720
15 meters of line. All these, I've had three guys here, but all the wrong guys who can't dig a

110
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,400
fucking trench. Oh, boy, I tried a little bit of humor, but I slipped. I didn't mean to say

111
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,360
fucking, but now it's getting a little frustrated, as you can understand. What I'm going to do

112
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,080
then, because when you become an agent at customer, you get an account manager and we're really

113
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,760
through to, I'm going to put you through to that gentleman. Who is that? But you haven't got

114
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,960
one to signed yet, but I'm going to try and put you through to my colleague, Mark, if he's free.

115
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,560
Okay. And, and each of you, I'm just going to say, Tony, she put this for you, and then help you

116
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,640
with your business in the future. That will be good. Okay, so be patient with me. I don't want to see

117
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,040
a fucking piece. Okay, thank you. Okay, so far, so far, this guy's saying all the right things,

118
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,040
right? I definitely want to have an account manager. It's interesting. I didn't have an account

119
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,040
manager up until today, and he's going to help me with my business, so he's saying all the right things

120
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,440
there. You know, this is stuff that's making me feel really good. However, this whole music

121
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,040
didn't make me feel so good.

122
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,600
We're sorry to keep you racing. Your call will be handled shortly.

123
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Creative, huh?

124
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,960
So this again was nine 15 this morning. After I'd already called the league guy, who said he would

125
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,800
keep me posted of anything and would call me on Monday and didn't. So I'm figuring this guy's running

126
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,280
around and going like, god, terrible. I got this dickhead on the phone. Thank you for holding. Your call will be

127
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,640
dealt with as soon as possible. I don't like being dealt with, man. I don't like being dealt with,

128
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:46,760
I like being helped. I like being serviced. So you only wonder what the guy was doing. You know,

129
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,920
did he get this guy in the phone? Did he explain who I was? Did he explain that I'm a customer?

130
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,400
That I don't have a customer representative yet? No one is helping with me with my business.

131
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,000
Sorry to keep you racing. Your call will be handled shortly.

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,920
Hmm, now I'm going to be handled instead of dealt with. All right. My call was being handled.

133
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,280
I could have edited this out, but it was too much fun to put you guys to the same pain I went through this

134
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,400
morning. So I'm literally just waiting just waiting. Hello Adam. Yes. So it's keeping you an old

135
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,960
end. Um, I had a discussion with the, yeah, kind of element thing. And they said that it's still kind of

136
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,320
skills, skills issues. I've just spoken to Phil. And he's going to call you back in a minute if that's okay.

137
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,520
Okay, you promise me he's going to come back a minute. Yeah, what's your number though?

138
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,360
Oh, okay. So I should fast forward through that shit night.

139
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,040
And then he doesn't get my number right because he, this is all, I'm not a zero, whatever.

140
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm on zero. Yeah. Yeah, I'm on one. Yeah.

141
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,400
The two main numbers in the mobile swipe. No, I don't know the zero in there somewhere.

142
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,320
Okay, that's fine. I'll get to call you back at him. Okay. Okay. Thank you.

143
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,800
Anyway, no problem, cheers. No problem, cheers.

144
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:03,160
Suck my knob. That was two hours ago. One minute is very long and easy net term. So we're still

145
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,840
waiting. And I have the phone right here actually hoping that someone will call back during this

146
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:14,680
podcast at which time, of course, I will, I will put the, the phone call through and take it, right?

147
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,040
And Patricia just walked in here earlier. And she said that fairer faucet of Charlie's Angel's

148
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,600
fame. And of course, she lived with the, then she, what was she married to? What's she married to?

149
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,520
Shoot. I don't know. She's a little bit wacky, but I kind of like her because she's, because she's a little bit wacky.

150
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,040
Now she's more than wacky. I'd have to say she's extremely wacky. She is suing.

151
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,000
I didn't get the full details, but she's suing a or, or multiple cosmetics companies because

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,880
she's so sick and tired of the lies they tell, of the fake commercials. And this is exactly what

153
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,320
Patricia says. Every single time she sees like the remote mascara commercial come on and just say,

154
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,920
it's God, the fucking fake fake eyelashes. They're pretending that this mascara gives you these

155
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,240
beautiful long eyelashes. And they're fake. They're fake put on eyelashes. They're not even real

156
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,840
eyelashes. And of course, you know, I said, well, but, you know, dear, look at Vogue. You know,

157
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,760
every single pictures photo shop. It's models don't have to lose weight or, or keep their weight

158
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,600
down or throw up or smoke cigarettes at all for their weight. I mean, they do it because they're

159
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,120
hooked on this shit, right? No, they, they just let it, you know, everything's photoshopped away.

160
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,960
It's like everything is like the fake radio voices that have turned us all on to podcasting and

161
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,800
getting into some real real stuff on on the radio or on your iPod or MP3 player, just audio sound,

162
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,440
you know. And so fair fuss that is pissed off about this and she wants to sue the entire

163
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,840
cosmetics industry or something like that. But I'm going to get Patricia on that. Maybe tomorrow

164
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,320
and we'll do a podcast. Well, I'll have her on as a special guest that talk about everything

165
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,400
fake in the cosmetics business, which she can know about because she has a cosmetics company.

166
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,400
So that's for tomorrow. Let's see, brief update on some of the stuff that happened yesterday on the

167
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,640
Daily Source Code. We had the trivia, which was sent to me by Stuart Hunter. And he, of course,

168
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,800
as promised, came back to me today, says Adam, that was fun. Fun playing it for you. Anyway,

169
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,360
here are the answers that I didn't get yesterday. I'm not going to play all the sound clips again

170
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,280
for you. But I really hope that people do this. I mean, let's keep it to a top three or top five.

171
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,640
But let's definitely try and stump me. And let's try and keep it 80s and 90s. You can do 60s,

172
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,600
70s and 80s. Okay. The 90s, I was over the hill and I don't know shit anymore. Maybe some,

173
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,480
but I missed a whole bunch. And I lived in, you know, in different countries. So, you know,

174
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,360
different hits. Very hard for me to track. But 60s, 70s and 80s. And I'm from 1964 and I bet

175
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,120
I bet you I could get a lot of 50s tunes, even. That's right. Here's the challenge. 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s.

176
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,360
Because I'm a disco jockey and I have all the Lawrence Welk albums. So, the first song that I

177
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,360
missed actually was Morrissey, every day is like Sunday. I'd never been into Morrissey. So,

178
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,360
that's probably why I didn't even catch it. Wet, wet, wet, love is all around. I had wet, wet, wet,

179
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,400
wet, wet, but at a wrong spot. Visage, fade, degree, I had right.

180
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,000
Live it up. I had the title right, but mental is anything. I didn't have the band, John Farne

181
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,320
the voice I had. Ice house. Shit, a little girl. I should have known that one. The

182
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:16,840
Connell 74, 74, 75, I think I got half of that title right. And then wonderful life. I got right,

183
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:23,640
but not black who did it. So, I'd basically pretty much sucked. But would like a rematch. So,

184
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,880
if anyone wants to send in a stump, the podcaster, stumped the prince of pod. Then feel free.

185
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,840
Because that's fun to do. I really do like it. Ken Gantt sent me an email. And all these, of course,

186
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,160
are linked from the show notes, which I'm contemplating today putting in the actual web post itself,

187
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,200
just to make it that much simpler, so that you can get right to it and don't have to go through

188
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,400
OPML or another, I'll still post it as OPML, obviously, because I'm hoping that applications are being

189
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,920
made everywhere. And people are trying to figure out ways to put show notes into their iPodder software.

190
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,920
But he was sent a listening diary by Arbitron. These are the guys that do the ratings for radio in

191
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,800
America. And he says, hopefully I'll go down in podcasting. History is the first person to

192
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,600
document a podcast that's shown my Arbitron radio diary. So, this is how the radio ratings are actually

193
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,080
maintained. Sure, they have some, some meters that people carry with them, but I think the majority

194
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,880
fill out a diary. And your station even gets points if they can name the DJ that's on the show

195
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,360
or on a show or on a station even. And so he had hoped to list the daily source code in the

196
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,040
diary, but couldn't get it around the fact that one of the pieces of data they require for each

197
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,160
entry is whether the show was on AM or FM. And you was afraid that listening that daily source

198
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:49,080
code might invalidate the diary. So, he did kind of an end around. He said, my favorite show is actually

199
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,840
and he did fill out podcast done by Leo LePort on KFI 640 AM in Los Angeles. Now, of course,

200
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,760
this is great because he lives in Louisville, Kentucky, Ken does. So, there's no way in hell,

201
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:08,840
he could have, he could have, have listened to this show in Los Angeles. So, let's see,

202
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,240
let's see if if that actually makes a difference. And maybe we should get podcasts on the

203
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,800
Arbitron diary. I mean, if it's a frickin' diary, right? It's, I don't know, it's just a thought.

204
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:28,040
Lots about the sound seeing tour. I'm going to second open up these outline here.

205
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:38,600
Lots of people sending in ideas about how to connect GPS data with sound files. And I think

206
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,080
fill up to Ron of in gadget has been working on some of this as well. I guess what we really need is

207
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:51,640
an iPod or an MP3 player that when you record something, records the GPS data of where the recording

208
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,360
was made. I don't think this is a device that does that. There will actually there are some devices,

209
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,600
but they're usually video. And of course, we need it both ways, right? It's one thing to actually

210
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,040
create a database. And for me to do a sound seeing tour. Oh, by the way, sound seeing.com was already

211
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:15,080
taken. I got sound seeing tour and sound seeing tours.com. Kind of the same, I guess. Not really

212
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:21,000
wanted one. But, and some other people registered pod sound seeing and some other things for

213
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,240
which was totally nice to them to do. And what was it? Oh, this was an email from Ryan

214
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,160
who says, hi from Snowy Road Island. Was rather intrigued to hear the Edward R. Moro clip posted

215
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,560
from another listener in the source code yesterday. I said, don't know if you know about CBS

216
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:47,000
history or the structure of radio at that time in the 1940s. It says that before Edward R. Moro came

217
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,840
to CBS, radio was very much scripted and edited down with little or no live broadcasts at all.

218
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:02,600
And really, Edward R. Moro was a pioneer in the sound seeing space. And actually wrote a book,

219
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,800
there was a book that came out called Edward R. Moro and the birth of broadcast journalism,

220
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,320
which is something that you might want to read if you're interested in, and really how

221
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,440
the first sound seeing tours got started and that blitz creek over in England. So that email

222
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:26,440
and others, including some great suggestions for something called geofencing, which Adam Bloom sent to

223
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,480
me. How twisted is that? Adam Bloom. It's like Ron Bloom and Adam Curry had an ugly love child.

224
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,560
Although Adam Bloom isn't ugly and he actually is related to Ron. But he sent me a whole bunch of

225
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,960
cool links which I've also posted in the show notes today that lead to geotracking because

226
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,440
what of course what we need is the reverse. When you're walking down the street and you hit a spot

227
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,280
or let's say you're within 10 meters proximity of a spot where I recorded something. That's when

228
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,000
you know, I want you to be able to access that file or even better it should probably already be

229
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,280
downloaded onto your device and we'll only play when you hit that spot. I mean that of course makes

230
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,040
the most sense. And I think some cell phone people are looking at ways of doing that

231
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,320
where you're cell phone actually then either sends you a message or alternatively I guess could

232
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,440
play some kind of file for you. So just a quote just thinking about it would be cool if we can get

233
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:28,040
some of that going. But just who got caught? Well I'm going to have myself a real good sound because

234
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:36,040
I feel alive man. I feel alive. Like I can take the world. I'm just turning inside out baby and floated

235
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:45,480
around in ecstasy. So don't stop me now. Don't stop me because I'm having a good sound.

236
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:53,640
Hello Adam. It's Paul here from podcastpool.com. I'd like to thank you for helping me not to sleep.

237
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,720
I came across an article of yours about a month ago on podcasting and for about a month

238
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I've tried to work out of the heck to make a podcast and now I can't stop making them.

239
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,160
My book shows just called Totally Eighties. It's all about the 1980s. Actually I didn't want to do

240
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,600
just about the 1980s. It had such brilliant response. There's been 6,000 hits in the last week.

241
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,880
So thanks very much mate and love the daily source code listen to it every day.

242
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,200
Apart from when you're not doing it. I hope you brought band connections okay. And the

243
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,600
track that you heard was from my friend Dan at dinemosrhythmases.com. They're not yet signed and

244
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,520
that's why podcast is so good to promote super bands like that. All the best mate and as I say

245
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,840
check this out. Totally eighties it's podcastpool.com. It shows you're only about 10 minutes or so.

246
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,120
So you can check it when you go to work or the band cool whatever you do. All the best. Bye

247
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,560
by now. Okay okay so podcastpool.com and actually went to the site of the artist that he mentioned

248
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:05,400
because I heard a really cool like lounge version of of Queens don't stop me now. And the band

249
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,600
has all these great cover songs that I really really would like to check out and play for in the

250
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,440
source code. Unfortunately no MP3 downloads which you know if you've got an independent band

251
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,280
make sure you can sell your CDs online. But please make some MP3 available. MP3 is available

252
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,880
for podcasts because we really want to help out and you know it's a podcast and good way to get

253
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,520
your stuff heard you know it's a good way to get stuff out there. And there was oh shoot I don't know

254
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,920
if I still have that article here I was keeping it for the longest time and I probably tossed it out.

255
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,240
Elvis Presley is the top of the charts again here in the UK and I was trying to dissect why. Usually

256
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,640
it's because some great you know back in the 80s you know you'd have like some fabulous

257
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,080
Levi's 501 jeans commercial and they'd add like wonderful world or don't remember it don't know

258
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,680
much about history. Oh I should see if I have that song for you actually. And these songs of course

259
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,520
immediately became hits because you know they were they were exposed to a whole new audience

260
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,760
basically the blue jeans buying audience and these songs stand by themselves right the great great

261
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:15,960
songs. But I didn't think there was any Elvis commercial that I'd seen out and Elvis has a

262
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,480
top of the charts now and then I figured it out. There's all kinds of let me just see what was I

263
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:32,760
trying to get. Don't know much about history. Wonderful world. Wonderful world this would be

264
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,520
wonderful world yeah I think I have at home let's just listen to that for one second and I've got to

265
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:47,240
route my iTunes through okay yeah I think this is it. Come on oh yeah now that's not one

266
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,120
I that's that's not what I was thinking now. Guess I don't have it. I thought I had that one.

267
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,280
Oh no I'm not stupid. Who was that? Was it wasn't Louis Armstrong was it?

268
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:06,920
Shoot okay don't have it sorry to disappoint you there. Anyway and in the paper the other day I

269
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,480
figured it out why you know all these Elvis tunes being re-released of course you know it was

270
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:19,080
his birthday recently etc. But in the United Kingdom as with the same as with I guess most countries

271
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:28,040
in the EU copyrights expire after 50 years. Now you'll remember a few years ago Sonny Bono before

272
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:37,640
he died. Potition to extend that amount of time in the United States to 95 years and actually

273
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,480
Sir Cliff Richard is here with the shadows is is petitioning around now saying you know oh my god

274
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,400
you know all these songs that were big hits for me that I still make money from are about to the

275
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,360
copyrights are about to expire and I'm still alive and you know and I'm going to stop making money on them

276
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,760
and of course you feel bad for Sir Cliff kind of right but on the other hand you know hey this is

277
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:05,480
what it's about you know now anyone can or should be able to record this song royalty free

278
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,600
or should be able to record it on disc royalty free I did say of course if it's performed

279
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,160
there's still all kinds of rights very confusing the way that works but there is a substantial amount

280
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:24,200
of income that's about to be lost from from Elvis Presley so first of all podcasts are out there

281
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,800
then now's a great time to you know record some Elvis tunes and get them released over here in the

282
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,080
UK if you record an Elvis tune you know I will gladly help you out and if it's good all

283
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,640
certainly play it on the daily source code but it's not interesting that that can happen here

284
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,200
the copyrights expire after 50 years and that it's 95 years in the States so all kinds of weird stuff

285
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,640
going on with the with music business and of course yesterday I promised you that since I

286
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:59,160
didn't have time today I would play that song as was promoted by what was it's webcrumbs breadcrumbs

287
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,600
web droppings it's here anyway here's the song it's Robert Burke Warren this is from the CD

288
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,920
Lazy I it's all right pod save music it's called junk man listen to it right here on the daily

289
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:21,240

00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Your daily source code for Tuesday, January 18th

340
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
2000 and five

341
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Something I didn't mention over the weekend

342
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,320
We took Jesse our big dog

343
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Which is a cross between a German shepherd and a golden retriever

344
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
We took her to the vet and have a great vet nearby here

345
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Because she hadn't been eating very well or at all for the past week

346
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
My dog is dying

347
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,320
She's 12 and a half years old, she's almost 13

348
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
She's always been extremely healthy

349
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
We got out of the pound when she was

350
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
As with all of our animals, we all get them out of the shelter

351
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,320
She was about one or one and a half

352
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
Perfect dog

353
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
It's just been the best dog you can imagine ever

354
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
And her liver is basically failing her

355
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
There's nothing you can do really

356
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,320
Except we put it on a different type of diet

357
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
She's eating great now

358
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
The doctor gave her a couple of antibiotics

359
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
It could be a minor infection in her liver

360
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
But basically the doctor said very clearly

361
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
You know, your dog is at the end of its life

362
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
And if she doesn't start eating then it's going to be

363
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
It's going to end pretty soon

364
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
So we're really happy that she's eating and she's full of life

365
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
As long as she's full of life and eating then I'm considering her

366
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Good to go

367
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,320
But yeah, you know, it happens all dogs

368
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
And so then we'll have God

369
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320
We've had so many animals go in the past couple of years

370
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
We had Dickie or Dick Ed actually

371
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,320
My cat who I had from my bachelor days in Amsterdam

372
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
He was 23 we had Gina, Pinkie

373
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
We had to put her down about four years ago

374
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
She had a few line aides

375
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Then we had Chrissy, our multi-stog

376
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
You've heard her on the podcast, right?

377
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,320
She had to put her down, she was blind and deaf pretty much

378
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
She had no quality of life left

379
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
She was way old, she was almost

380
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,320
She was also 13, 14 years old

381
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,320
And then we basically will have two cats

382
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,320
And we have shrubber, our little yorky

383
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
He's still going strong, he's a crazy mut

384
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Anyway, so that's just a bit of personal biz

385
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Something else a lot of people have been sending the emails about

386
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Which I was aware of since I was talking about easy jet

387
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
And I've booked another easy jet flight by the way

388
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Thursday going to Amsterdam couple meetings

389
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Going to finalize the television show that I've been talking about

390
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
We basically sold it, now we have to get down to the details

391
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
What did I sell, how many episodes did I sell

392
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
And you know, what is the budget going to be, etc

393
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
So that's kind of fun

394
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
And then I have another meeting at Graham Masterview

395
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Which I'm taking on Friday

396
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,320
And what everyone, what every, oops, hold on, there's that drunken thing again

397
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,320
There we go

398
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
What everyone's been emailing me about is the introduction of the new airbus

399
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
I'm sure by now you've heard about it, it happened yesterday

400
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,320
The new airbus A380

401
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,320
What mother load this is, huh?

402
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
It's a double decker

403
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
Can carry up to 800 passengers

404
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Which is twice to 747

405
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
If configured in all economy, class mode

406
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Virgin airs ordered six of them I think

407
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,320
And in all they have already have like 120 orders or something

408
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
But these things looks just awesome, you're so big

409
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,320
And I'm wondering, you know, I have a call into Wing Commander William

410
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
I'm going to try and hook up with them Thursday

411
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,320
And get some fixed wind flying and he has a assess number 182

412
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
That he's been patching up and I can't wait to try and fly it with him

413
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
And I'll ask him, what kind of runway these fuckers need

414
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
It's like damn

415
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
This thing is so big, it must be so heavy

416
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
I mean it can't land everywhere, I have no idea

417
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
And as I sit here looking at my screen

418
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
I see that there's new software available for my computer

419
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
It's the new version of iTunes

420
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Let's not install that on this slow link, shall we?

421
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
It's only 8.66 megabytes now

422
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,320
So anyway, I'll get some details on the airbus 380 man

423
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
These things are interesting

424
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,320
And I've already heard that some configurations may include a jacuzzi

425
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
I thought the sleeper seats were cool

426
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
Hey Adam, I'm PW Fenton

427
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,320
Create a radio-free radios digital flatsum

428
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,320
I don't know, maybe you've heard it, I hope you have

429
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
But I'm looking for a favor from you

430
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
My podcast

431
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:37,320
Oh, I don't know, I'd call it like the podcast version of the Ed Sullivan show

432
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Well, no longer second

433
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
There could only be one Ed Sullivan of podcast thing

434
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,320
In that I try to be just a little bit of everything

435
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,320
There's no guiding light

436
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
You might hear some sort of a jazz performance

437
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Followed by a comedy routine

438
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Followed by some kind of a rant

439
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
Followed by whatever

440
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
The idea is that it's kind of a stream of consciousness

441
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Kind of show, even though it's put together

442
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Fairly slickly

443
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,320
What I'm hoping that I can get from you Adam is just a plug

444
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,320
On your show, everybody listens to your show, I listen to your show, I listen to your show

445
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Every day

446
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,320
I only have time to create my show once a week

447
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
But I listen to your show every single day

448
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
I figure out some way to work it in

449
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,320
What I'm looking for is just some kind of a little plug that you could give me

450
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,320
And more than that, just a suggestion for people who are listening

451
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,320
And I know people are listening because people download the thing

452
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,320
To give me some kind of feedback

453
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,320
They can find me at PWFenton

454
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
At digitalflotsom.org

455
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,320
And, you know, just to send me an email

456
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Let me know what it is you think about what I'm doing

457
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
Right on, so it's digitalflotsom.org

458
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,320
And I just couldn't resist playing that promo because he was so polite and so nice

459
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,320
PWFenton, and he has a very intriguing voice

460
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
And you know what, when I get some fucking bandwidth today

461
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,320
By the way, 1134, still no word from my account manager

462
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
It's easynet.co.uk

463
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,320
But he has an interesting voice, so I'll definitely check out the podcast

464
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Hey, if someone's doing an Ed Sullivan podcast, I definitely want to know about it

465
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,320
Hey, Adam, this is Eric over at developmentc.org

466
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,320
I know you don't like Skype right now, and for good reason

467
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
But I want to let you know that it might be getting better

468
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,320
I just got an email from Skype, inviting me to a three free month trial of voice messaging

469
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
I guess it's their version of voice mail

470
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,320
So, anyway, that calls for him another call now

471
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
No ringing in the air, goes right to voice mail

472
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,320
When I don't want to talk to you, reject, I didn't hang up, they go to voice mail

473
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,320
And if I'm not around, they also go to voice mail

474
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,320
I just tried it out, you can leave a 60 second message

475
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,320
And it's cool, I can tell someone I can check these messages from many computer

476
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,320
So, I don't know how we got one of these cool beta voice mail accounts, but I definitely love to have one

477
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,320
And I really, I don't, it's not like a hate Skype right now

478
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
It's just that I've seen that they're missing such a tremendous opportunity

479
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Here's a product that almost every single podcast or uses in one form of the other

480
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,320
It wouldn't take much to make it just a little bit better and make it perfect for it

481
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Hey, I'd even pay extra for some services that's, you know, to get Skype to do certain things

482
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,320
Like recording, Skype could be perfect for recording an entire podcast

483
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
You don't necessarily have to be talking to someone, you know

484
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,320
If, if it has the capability to record MP3, then for God's sake, let's try and get that working

485
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,320
So thank you very much, Eric, and I'm wondering if these voice mail accounts are this like a Gmail account, you know

486
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Send me one of those, I can get some Skype voice mail

487
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,320
And here we go, we have some actual paper, yesterday as I was waiting in vain

488
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,320
For someone to show up at the door, like, you know, British telecom

489
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,320
There was a ring, and it wasn't BT, there was a van outside, so first I thought, oh, goody, you know, he's here

490
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
The man to dig the trenches here

491
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
It wasn't, it was federal express

492
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,320
And they delivered a small package and in the package, a letter

493
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,320
From Chris Anderson, editor in chief of wired magazine dated January 13, 2005, dear Adam

494
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,320
I'm delighted to let you know that you've been nominated in the tech innovator category for wired magazines

495
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,320
2005 wired rave awards

496
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,320
I forgot the pumpkin, the tympany pumpkin

497
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
The wired rave awards is an annual magazine featuring

498
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Feature celebrating the people changing your mind

499
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,320
The rave awards are selected by wired editors, honor innovators and 14 categories

500
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Ranging from business to design to entertainment to science

501
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Please keep your nomination under wraps as we will formally announce the nominees January 18, 2005

502
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,320
And this year's winners will be unveiled at the six annual rave awards celebration

503
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,320
At the legendary film Warren San Francisco February 22, 2005

504
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
And published in wired smarts 2005 issue

505
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Excellent, hey, goddamn

506
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Let's see, it's still, let me see, is it still pretty early in

507
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,320
On the west coast in the states, let's see if wired has released it yet

508
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
See who the other nominees are

509
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
I wonder how that works if it's

510
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
I just don't know

511
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,320
So in the tech, what is it tech innovator category, first of all, I'm honored

512
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
And I presume it's for podcasting

513
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Let's see if I can find out who, because you know, I'd love to go to this show on February 22

514
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,320
But as usual, you know, you kind of only want to go when you know you want to win

515
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Right?

516
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,320
But seeing as, I guess who chooses this, is this the wired editors choose this?

517
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,320
So it's not like a public prize then, no, I don't see anything I'm looking at wired.com

518
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:32,320
I don't see any, I see cell phone, shushing, push button, wine tasting

519
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Oh, wired, it's got some good stuff, doesn't it?

520
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Okay, so, no, not out yet, but it will, so you have, there you go

521
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,320
There's a premiere, everybody, a premiere news event on the source code

522
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,320
All right, cool, so maybe I will go out for that, we'll have to see one thing for sure

523
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
One thing for sure

524
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
It's good, everyone!

525
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
If you're not, all making me laugh

526
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
If you're not

527
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
Morning, doing a night

528
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,320
That's it for today's source code, thank y'all for the subscribers

529
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
And that is what we have to say, right?

00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320

532

Or if you have a shovel, I know how to hook up the wires from the curb to the house

533
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
It's atamacurry.com, we'll leave a comment on my weblog

535
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,320
All right, today is a big day, because I'm going to get my haircut

536
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Take me down to Tony and Guy, or Chuchin Shisha

537
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,320
Whatever, it's going to stand there and make sure they do everything just right

538
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
Don't mess it up

539
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
So who knows how happy I'll be tomorrow, right?

540
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,320
And have yourself a great day, great evening, right after noon, whenever you may be checking out the source code

541
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Talk to you tomorrow, everybody, for the hum day edition of your daily source code

542
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Bye bye

Peace out
