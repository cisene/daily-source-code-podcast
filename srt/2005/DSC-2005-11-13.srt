1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Okay, tell me as the winner is at five o'clock. Take off to the slip.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,720
The answer is one night or seven, so I'd all put on to your hotel, then we keep six left for take off.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,600
Good morning, Delta Sierra Charlie 279. This is the daily source code, a special edition.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
It's Adam Doug and David, and as you can tell, we're not in the hotel room.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,200
Good morning, guys. Good morning. We are just about to leave Ontario. Is the airfield or airport?

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,520
What is it, airport? I think I have my phone on, still. That's kind of nice.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,320
We're in Doug's Peninsula, so whenever you hear November 1, 9, 7, 5,

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,600
Alpha, then here we have a control list talking to us, and we're cleared for take off.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,120
And we're going to talk a little bit about the expo on our way from Ontario to San Francisco.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,160
We have 95 knots and Doug's yanketer back.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,120
And once again, the marble of flight. It works.

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,840
Always amazing.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,840
Me too, my friend. So this is actually, it's three pilots on board this aircraft. Doug of course,

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
has been flying since the Wright brothers.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
Morning, Ontario. You've been at 14.37 on the island in six left.

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,200
I've been flying a rotary.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,320
I have two fifths, six weeks, and three years ago. I got seven.

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,000
Three kilos, and no traffic now, two o'clock. Two miles,

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,040
one left bound, and then again, three miles, and eight hundred.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Traffic's been flying for three kilos.

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,120
How did you bet I can't hear you, Doug? Well, you talk as a radio.

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,400
It's number one, nine, or seven, five off the total part of your radar connect.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,440
Do not come up with three miles, those five are traffic.

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,240
We should be driving above you at 11 o'clock. Come on, northbound.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,520
I can hear at 35. We train southbound a couple miles.

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,120
Yeah, that's really too bad. When you talk on the radio,

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
then it doesn't come through on the inner top.

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,880
We're getting to southbound. We're very, very wide off of the minute, eight, five,

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,320
and off of, kind of approach on, one, three, five, point four.

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,520
One, two, five, point four, eight, five off.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,920
Okay, we good now. Over eight, golf,

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,640
boys talk. Do not likely find that I have a little place?

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,920
Find eight thousand five.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,360
Eight hundred, one, three, four, more isolated our telescopes going get in.

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
Yeah, we're almost to two, and half hours' feed.

36
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,120
Number seven. Five, and half a Jeffreyти traffic.

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
Off your right), turning to the ease.

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,180
The facts about ultimately no factory include manufacture of kinebird,

39
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,100
here to disaster consumption and fuel.

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,280
All right, there we go.

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,920
David, I realize I didn't even know your last name.

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,520
I'm David Marks.

43
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Tell me what else about yourself, David.

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,560
Well, let's see Doug and I actually work together at good company.com.

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,720
Years and years ago during the.com move.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,160
Dial in at four.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,640
Okay.

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,360
Dial in three, four, nine, or four, five, plus.

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
It's on actual killer approach.

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,920
One, three, five, points, zero, five.

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,680
One, three, five, points, zero, five, dotter, four, five, dotter.

52
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,800
Since then, I've been working at a few different startups.

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,840
One was a web development company called the studios.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,440
And after that, we were required by motor media.

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,440
And all I ever voted media very well.

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,880
Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,480
And a bunch of the engineers out of, out of,

58
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,960
did it went to the startup co-modest solutions.

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,200
And a few of us are working together on a company called Lumia.

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,520
Very nice to have a kind of approach on one, three, five,

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,200
point four.

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
Did you say Lumia?

63
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,200
So if we have a website at Lumia.com,

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,400
they provide five of their filtering across podcasts.

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,960
Yeah.

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,640
Maybe on four, three, kilo per department,

67
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,840
the traffic off of Ontario, remain north of interstate 10.

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,160
If you're familiar with that.

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,200
Four, four, kilo.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,800
I'd like to see if the content is for a couple of my bills.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,080
Made from this underneath to their one-of-lock,

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
running northeast, kind of,

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,800
lightly going to the northeast a little bit there in front of you.

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
Well, those are you just,

75
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,160
a little bit busy listening to this type of podcast.

76
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,720
This is especially in the way pilots have conversations in the air.

77
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,400
And you know, that we talked a little bit

78
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,000
that we, uh, we can't something that's intended for us on the radio.

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,920
We're always, uh, always listening to that in the background, right?

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,600
So, so Lumia does collaborative filtering across podcasts.

81
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,240
That's what you're saying.

82
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,480
Right.

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,640
Right.

84
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,120
Right.

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,280
Right.

86
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,360
Right.

87
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,440
Right.

88
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,520
Right.

89
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:48,600
Right.

90
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:48,760
Right.

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,240
Right.

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,480
Right.

93
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,720
Right.

94
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:49,880
Right.

95
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,120
Right.

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,760
Right.

97
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,080
Right.

98
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,240
Right.

99
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,720
Right.

100
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:51,960
Right.

101
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,200
Right.

102
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Right.

103
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,240
Right.

104
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,720
Right.

105
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,440
Right.

106
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:54,760
Right.

107
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,240
Right.

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,720
Right.

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:55,880
Right.

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,040
We'll help them find other content that they would like to be.

111
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,320
It's not what people like themselves are enjoying.

112
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,080
That is not intended to automate it.

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
That's, uh, some kind of,

114
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,280
that's, that's a bit similar to that.

115
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,680
Yeah.

116
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,080
If you're right.

117
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,160
Yeah.

118
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,640
Exactly.

119
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,040
Order it.

120
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,000
That machine learning stuff.

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,640
So, uh, okay.

122
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,040
It's like a smarter and the more people who use it,

123
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,000
it's all automated.

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,760
Well, this is great because this is, uh,

125
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,680
exactly the opposite of what we're doing.

126
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,320
Uh, so, um, really interesting

127
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,560
talking about, does that mean you're trying to help people

128
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,440
point things they don't like?

129
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,600
No, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm at the

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,160
Thanks Doug.

131
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,320
Look, who makes the jokes here, man?

132
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,000
You just buy the goddamn airplane, okay?

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,520
Shut up, I'm, I'm doing it.

134
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,240
Now, um, in fact, I think I'm, I think I'm much more on Doug's side.

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,200
Or a three-kill kind of, uh, we can talk a little bit about, uh,

136
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,640
there are about the ex-coventies.

137
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,240
Um, I fell there.

138
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,480
Thanks.

139
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
Thank you for thinking about, thank you.

140
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,240
Um, there are a lot, there are a lot of companies, um,

141
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,280
wanting to provide technological innovation and solutions, uh,

142
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,880
things, um,

143
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,840
broadcasting, whereas at this point, I feel that we, you know,

144
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,880
we need to prove on a lot of the existing stuff,

145
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,880
so make it easier for people to listen, make it easier for people to,

146
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,920
publish.

147
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,880
But I'm really, pretty much focused on, uh,

148
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,200
the root of everything, which is the talent.

149
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,400
And it's what I like Doug about your podcast Academy,

150
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
and I think that I was probably one of the most valuable things

151
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,360
of the entire conference, you know, people really wanted to learn

152
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,640
how to hold their craft, because there's just a,

153
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,200
I think there's a percentage of people who really want to learn how to, uh,

154
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,760
to work in this field and learn about audio and, uh, and find out what,

155
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,960
what different things you could do.

156
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,200
Uh, and so that's, that's really where we're at as well as how do we

157
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
invest in the talent.

158
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't care necessarily how it's distributed, uh,

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,440
so in essence, Lumi has really helping us quite a bit.

160
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,320
I would prefer to go, far to trust what you're editing.

161
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,080
Right. I mean, the idea is really, they're, they're a lot of different things

162
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,560
you need to go with the web to be in play.

163
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
I think of a podcast thing that they're only making.

164
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,480
Another one that you're now in, that's the way it was,

165
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,440
the part of the team.

166
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,680
One is probably able to want to talk about the environment,

167
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,280
and they have to be able to come in through about,

168
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,520
yeah, because that's not the advice component like you use.

169
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,120
And it's not because we're really, really, really hard,

170
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,960
but it's really satisfying.

171
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,760
So I think all these things are, uh,

172
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,560
they're all important.

173
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,960
So what did you think of the conference?

174
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,200
Oh, bring me away.

175
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,800
I was, I was amazed by it.

176
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,480
I mean, I recognize that I was involved when I involved.

177
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,160
Back in King, you were a little far too,

178
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,880
broke with invited a bunch of us up to Seattle.

179
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,120
The theater, the discuss this thing,

180
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,320
and consider where we were 11 months ago.

181
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,800
You can imagine by skepticism how we can invent this thing.

182
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,360
Yeah, I didn't know it was phenomenal.

183
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,040
People were going to hold off on the beautiful thing.

184
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,720
I mean, it was the first class in every way.

185
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,760
He had the exhibit hall was packed with quality vendors.

186
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,480
Everything can come to you about it.

187
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,160
The presentations were excellent.

188
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,000
I think everything about it was first class.

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
And I think, yeah, if it was, yeah,

190
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,440
it was the attendees was unbelievable.

191
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,920
I really, I was really amazed to see how many people came out

192
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,640
that I had only heard before on the internet.

193
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,720
They're all, you know, they're all there.

194
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,240
They were listeners who had sponsored their favorite

195
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
plugcasters to come to the event.

196
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,960
Is that right?

197
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,160
Oh, yeah, tons of them.

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
There were lots of listeners there, just in general,

199
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,120
who were fans of podcast, but like Mark,

200
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:25,160
from the target of podcast, one of his listeners matched his pledge drive,

201
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,760
or whatever it was.

202
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,480
And as you probably want to think about $700 on the broke,

203
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,320
pocket to help get him to the expo.

204
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,920
Can he give over to Scotland, right?

205
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,640
You, who?

206
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,520
Is that right, yeah?

207
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Yeah, exactly.

208
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,240
And here's a great accent from the event.

209
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,240
So there's a lot of great music coming out of Scotland right now.

210
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,360
But what, um, it felt like they're,

211
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,600
what do you think were the main themes?

212
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,560
What were the people, the attendees looking for,

213
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,600
looking to get out of this, out of this event?

214
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
Besides, besides, I mean, the obvious which to me

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,960
was the most important is everyone being able to meet each other

216
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,560
and swap stories kind of like a, a big swap beat,

217
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,760
crossed with a start trick convention.

218
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,320
It's kind of what it felt like.

219
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,920
All right, I think that, well, first of all,

220
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,320
the main theme was just being on the roller coaster.

221
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,800
You know, everyone's thinking, you know, this is a great ride.

222
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Yeah, and we're really enjoying the fact that,

223
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,080
that's one of the things I said and one of my presentations was,

224
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,320
we're all getting a lot more attention to we deserve.

225
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,520
That's right.

226
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,160
And, um, and my, my challenge for the audience was how are you going to use that attention?

227
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,360
Because, uh, you have a lot of, we have a lot of clubs like that.

228
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,040
And we're not all out of Paris, but I asked every people of the audience

229
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,600
I've been interviewed by local papers, local people.

230
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,880
Yeah, a lot of people in it.

231
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,840
Yeah.

232
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,600
And, uh, I think everybody feels a great positive opportunity

233
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,360
to take a difference in the world.

234
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,760
And I saw quite a bit of that.

235
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,240
You know, a lot of people were commenting that,

236
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,600
what is the, what's the big fundamental difference between

237
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,240
vlogging and podcasting and that?

238
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,520
What are the key things with that?

239
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,320
People's voice really carries a lot more, um, or emotional content to it.

240
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,000
It's more powerful.

241
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,840
And that a lot of people are podcasting because being able to speak and say things

242
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,440
and hear another voice is just, it makes it deeper impression on them.

243
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,360
I think the, uh, the main difference between vlogging and podcasting

244
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,880
is that, uh, there is a huge listener to man for podcasts.

245
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,400
Uh, weblogs have audiences, but I think that's much more about someone's desire to publish.

246
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,600
But what I really saw happen is because of things you just mentioned, David,

247
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,280
the, uh, the passion that you can hear.

248
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,800
I think that's the word, if anything, is the passion you're hearing someone's voice

249
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,640
when they're talking about something they really need to or interested in, uh,

250
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,200
that, uh, that is resonated so loudly with the listeners because they,

251
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,760
and some of them have never heard that before the radio.

252
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,000
You know, and you and I kind of remember that.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,920
Yeah, um, but people have just blown away by, oh my god, this is a new type of radio,

254
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,600
new type of audio haven't heard this.

255
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,640
I've been eating to death by the same voices and the same formats and the same packaging

256
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,320
for 15 or 20 years.

257
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,760
I think I begin the case of vlogging comparison.

258
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,320
I think the results are simpler than that vloggers are obviously passionate about what they're

259
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,000
the difference is that the standing point is the one that's right for the difference.

260
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,680
The venturnalism is the same thing as the radio.

261
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,200
So, like you say, out of comparison to what's on the visual radio.

262
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,080
So, obviously different.

263
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,720
So, we have to get vlogging. There's always the comparison of journalists.

264
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,240
Our vlogger is journalists.

265
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,440
But one of the other is a lot of bending, but you don't ride between the director

266
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,560
on a radio broadcast.

267
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,680
On a regional list, it's a bit too big, but it's a big offensive.

268
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,880
Good vlogging tool.

269
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,040
They say, oh, vloggers are probably journalists.

270
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,800
Good vlog, vlog, vlog, vlog, vlog, vlog, vlog.

271
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,520
In the case of radio, a vlog, we've got people who are helping ship radio and say,

272
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
I want to be in their podcast, right?

273
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,560
Yes, this is like, this is what I got into this business to do.

274
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,200
And it's interesting, we had an opportunity to meet with a whole bunch of people for one or one meetings.

275
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
I don't know, sir.

276
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,440
Oh, no, no, no.

277
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,560
Not really good, but a break, definitely a seven, five, eight golf.

278
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,280
We get to try.

279
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
So, what?

280
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,880
Alright, so we just passed through what 10,000 feet, 10,000 feet, 10,000 feet, 10,000 feet,

281
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,400
10,000 feet, 10,000 feet, 10,000 feet, 10,000 feet, 10,000 feet.

282
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Oh, I'm going to kind of dizzy you dug.

283
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,120
And, I can no accident.

284
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
We're going to burn it five.

285
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,120
Don't have any water.

286
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,400
No, well, yes.

287
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Hang on.

288
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,760
Okay.

289
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,720
Oh, what for me?

290
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,120
Okay.

291
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,640
I actually, I mean, I'm going back to the history books.

292
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,040
that's kind of where I'm going to, is all right.

293
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,160
Remember all that great stuff that people were doing with sound and with radio and with broadcasting

294
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,320
in the whole concept of theater of the mind and relationship with your audience.

295
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,600
We actually commissioned Supplylets, not as an aviators, but as in a drama called Shadow Falls,

296
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,240
so we're going to do a real radio drama, which would be completely, well, look, we have no

297
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:25,160
a virtual malfunction issues in our business, so it's going to be really, you know, it's going to be like a steamy

298
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,680
novel, I think almost, what does that come up?

299
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,160
The pilot should be done in a couple of weeks, it's a Mark from a Pacific Coast Norway,

300
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:42,600
about 1,000 or 3,000 or 1,000. Those guys are really creative, and we're commissioning a pilot for a game show.

301
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,280
What do you think about the company, Baba?

302
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:51,160
Which will work with Skype, so I'm just going back and look at all the cool stuff, the cool formats,

303
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,960
that even though they were great, we're still restricted by the concept of time,

304
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,640
which of course we have no issue with our time on podcasts, it's not giving up in the 32nd of the challenge.

305
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,680
It's fine, don't be wrong.

306
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,600
I think the opportunity is to pursue your life a lot of work.

307
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,320
Yeah, Mark, I think you're ready for a video.

308
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,640
Yeah, you've got the capabilities back when you were in the US and I got that.

309
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,760
It was a radio point, it was a family entertainment, it was sitting around the radio for the weekly

310
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,560
the shadow.

311
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,520
Yeah, but here we were in 75 off of a traffic 11 and five and eight miles,

312
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,800
orbiting at 12, five days there for photos, did you want to turn right 30 degrees?

313
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Yeah, so we're now going on a gov turn right, we're redirecting from one of the

314
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
all.

315
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,760
We're turning right, we're redirecting degrees for some guys, you know, I'm still taking pictures

316
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
apparently.

317
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
It's a great day for that.

318
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
I think you take pictures here, you go.

319
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Oh, okay.

320
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,480
We get a few of them, that's kind of, yeah, we've got to show notes, that's right, very cool.

321
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,640
Look, I get to blind David, but got me into blind, yeah, I'd always wanted to do

322
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
it.

323
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I used to build flight simulators at home with five off of them.

324
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Okay, just here.

325
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
All right.

326
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,440
I mean, I find up several of the proponators, different computers, never come together, so

327
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,880
I could get a wide screen, a wide screen display, and eventually my girlfriend and

328
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,640
Amanda said, you know, why don't you just take flying, let's get your fly fly.

329
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
It's probably cheaper at this point.

330
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
That's right.

331
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,640
And, uh, I really dug with the guy who took me off for a...

332
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
First round.

333
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,640
I'll probably dive in.

334
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,640
I like direct open flight via GPS.

335
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Great.

336
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
What's a run time done?

337
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Well, let's get the toes down from level now, let's look at the USB pickup, and we'll

338
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,640
let you go so far, the GPS is one, two, four.

339
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Let's get a speed across, we just want to come in up.

340
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,640
We don't know shortly.

341
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Very clean.

342
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,640
That a beautiful day, very light headwinds will do that.

343
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
We'll do a headwind calculation.

344
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
We'll get our new way further here.

345
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
What does the aircraft do?

346
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Here we go.

347
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Here we go.

348
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,640
At this altitude, probably about a hundred and ninety three dots.

349
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
We're going to number five.

350
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
We'll go down.

351
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
We'll go down.

352
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
We'll go down.

353
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
We'll go down.

354
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
At eighty five, we'll go down.

355
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
We'll go down.

356
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
At eighty thousand feet.

357
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
We'll get two hundred twelve dots.

358
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Right.

359
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
We'll get about four to forty five.

360
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
We'll go.

361
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
We're going to stay at twelve and a half.

362
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Right.

363
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
We'll be here.

364
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Now, Doug is doing his little lean-to-peat trick, which makes a blow up an engine a year.

365
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,640
And hands at five, all but done at John's.

366
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
We'll approach one two four point five.

367
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
One point five.

368
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
One point five.

369
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
John's.

370
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Five.

371
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Five.

372
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Just got to Joshua for a kill.

373
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
We're going to drop them.

374
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Okay.

375
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
That's not a regular trouble.

376
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Five.

377
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Three.

378
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Six.

379
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Three.

380
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
That's a good deal.

381
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
It's a pretty good deal.

382
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
It makes you feel good.

383
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Yeah.

384
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Great.

385
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Four.

386
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
One.

387
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
One.

388
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
One.

389
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
One.

390
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
One.

391
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
One.

392
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Seven.

393
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Five.

394
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Four.

395
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Two.

396
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Six.

397
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Four.

398
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Four.

399
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Seven.

400
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Five.

401
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Five.

402
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Five.

403
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Five.

404
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
One.

405
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Five.

406
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Five.

407
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Five.

408
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Six.

409
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Six.

410
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Six.

411
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Seven.

412
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Six.

413
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Six.

414
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
Six.

415
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Six.

416
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Six.

417
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
One.

418
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Five.

419
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Fried in the pressure.

420
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
One.

421
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Four.

422
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Four.

423
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Six.

424
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,520
All right, now we'll, uh, pull this, we'll come back to the, uh, gas exhaust and a bit of,

425
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,640
we'll get a hit 3, 3, 2, 4, a little bit here.

426
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,640
We'll get ourselves up to about 165 knots, complicated.

427
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
And indicated, of course, that's the wind blowing into the moment marvel.

428
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,640
That does it, it's beautiful because we're at 12.5.

429
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
We hear it's real.

430
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,640
That means our actual speed for the air is quite a bit higher.

431
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
We'll do a calculation at, find out what the true SD is.

432
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
I would continue to ground to be at the moment.

433
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Here it is, is 168 knots.

434
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,640
So, we can have a headwind going to probably in the 29th of this afternoon.

435
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
We'll come clear that too.

436
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
GPS is changing.

437
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,640
GPS allows us to find out what the thing to be, remember it could do before.

438
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,640
We're going to say I quite enjoy flying on the old school without the GPS, I've been kind of,

439
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
you can on the VR trip recently.

440
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Now, if you have it, you can get it to play.

441
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Oh, yeah, of course.

442
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Okay, remember it's three things.

443
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
I've got to take a picture.

444
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
I've got to go to the first point three times.

445
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
I mean, because if we can see the GPS, I would never want to go back.

446
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Yeah, but I'm going towards my instrument rate.

447
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
So, I got to do it.

448
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Yeah, I got to practice.

449
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Well, let's do this.

450
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
So, now you have to imagine this on the podcast.

451
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,640
But we're going into the middle place where we go here.

452
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
So, that's a lot of fun stuff.

453
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
And what you want to go through a little bit.

454
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
We've got to go right into my podcast now.

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Get this guy.

456
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,640
And then we go here to a bit of the altitude to the altitude to the altitude.

457
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,640
By the indicated altitude here is 12,500 feet.

458
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
But that is good.

459
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,640
But the calipen with air speed is what the sound of the front.

460
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
We put that in calm.

461
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Now, the headwinds.

462
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Well, that's all there.

463
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
So, please go to the altitude.

464
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
We put that in the air pressure.

465
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
That's a bit different.

466
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
For the top of the one two one.

467
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
I go to the way.

468
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
I think that way.

469
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Here we go.

470
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Thank you.

471
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
We have a second here.

472
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
temperature.

473
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Any of these are classified.

474
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
The most you don't know if you're going to do this is done.

475
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,640
But 7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8.

476
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
We're getting on the heading.

477
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
We're so forward.

478
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
We're looking back ahead.

479
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
All right.

480
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,640
The computer tells me.

481
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Attention.

482
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
The opportunity to start with 505.

483
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,640
So, it was slightly warmer than the standard pain.

484
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
So, we'll be able to do it.

485
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,980
So it was a slightly warmer than the standard day.

486
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,280
Our true history is 1.96 when I say 1.95.

487
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,480
Generally rare times that day.

488
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,020
1.01 miles south of the winds.

489
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,820
You know, first of all, you can check it out here for it.

490
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,320
The winds are about hitting 2.5 at 23 knots.

491
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
So we can do it.

492
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,720
I want you to move over to the left hand with an SSI at 20 knots.

493
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,400
It's 23 knots.

494
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,240
Which is the equivalent of a 23 knots hit with 20 knots.

495
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,960
So, not too bad.

496
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,520
So, it's going from south to north, which is back in with that.

497
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,720
We also have a couple of more headwinds, which says that we will always have headwinds

498
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
about which we will fly out.

499
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,720
So, what you're hearing now is exactly what every pilot wants is to fly with someone who's

500
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,200
going to run through an explanation of everything that's being done.

501
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,720
And that's basically how we learn how to do this shit.

502
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Right.

503
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,280
Right now, the other word, you level through, and our health is getting close, you

504
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,560
know, I'm going to see an SSI in private route, one hour and 34 minutes over.

505
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,280
Oh man, I shouldn't have taken jet blue.

506
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,040
So, I think you can go up just to get this security.

507
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Right.

508
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I especially mean.

509
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,000
That's like, we've all the gadgets.

510
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh, man.

511
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,040
I always get nailed, but I'm very successful in getting my lighter through now.

512
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Okay.

513
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Yeah.

514
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
That's still allowed.

515
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
No.

516
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Oh, now.

517
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
I think you have lighter.

518
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,120
So, I don't know what this is about regarding it's saying the same, right?

519
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Yeah.

520
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,040
I remember the things of the big lighters back and forth.

521
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
Right.

522
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I know it's coming.

523
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
It's a cell phone cell phone.

524
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Yeah.

525
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
I could put it.

526
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Don't pick lighters.

527
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Can't blink those in.

528
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Yeah.

529
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
But everybody's got a backman.

530
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Yeah.

531
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
It's a cell phone.

532
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
And then turn them on and then wave them back and forth.

533
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Oh, no.

534
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Just a side of the chain train.

535
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Yeah.

536
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
I noticed that.

537
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Bricks in the cat and me wanted to take my daughter to see.

538
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
I think we deserve something like that.

539
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
And that is quite an interesting phenomenon.

540
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
I mean, just be patches.

541
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Right.

542
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Remember those things?

543
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Right.

544
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
All the invention of the lighter.

545
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I could remember what it was, you know, Flint.

546
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Flint and those starting to fire with sticks.

547
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
But Doug now, look, give me some perspective on that.

548
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Because we make light of that.

549
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
But man, look what's happened in 10 years.

550
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Just with cell phones alone.

551
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Do you think that it will come a point?

552
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,040
I mean, I'm having these things now, where I actually stop and look around and say, oh, my God.

553
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Look what happened with them.

554
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
We're also partially responsible for it.

555
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Right.

556
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Point eight to us.

557
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Thank you.

558
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Now, we come right off the contact route.

559
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,040
And there's one, two, five point eight.

560
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Point eight to one.

561
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
All right.

562
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Let's talk to these guys.

563
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
You can hand it.

564
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Dr. Protor, a sector of the sector.

565
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Remember.

566
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
In this case, we're being handed in front.

567
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
But what facility?

568
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
For another Joshua approach is a facility.

569
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
A first control facility.

570
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,040
The handle is at which it supports base and places like that.

571
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
The overflow park there is base.

572
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
And now, we're switching back to Los Angeles City,

573
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,040
which is handled in high altitude area.

574
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
I think they're about.

575
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Somebody said it or something.

576
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Because it's seven and eight.

577
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Something like that.

578
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Yeah.

579
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
So there's Los Angeles City on the west coast.

580
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Both with them, Seattle.

581
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
They come all the west coast.

582
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Isn't it dead for two?

583
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Yeah.

584
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Yep.

585
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
All right.

586
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Let's go.

587
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
One, two, three.

588
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
One, two, three.

589
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
One, two, three.

590
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040

591
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
One, two, three.

592
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
One, two, three.

593
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
One, two, three.

594
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
One, two, three.

595
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
One, two, three.

596
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
One, two, three.

597
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
One, two, three.

598
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
One, two, three.

599
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
One, two, three.

600
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
One, two, three.

601
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
One, two, three.

602
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
One, two, three.

603
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
One, two, three.

604
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
One, two, three.

605
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
One, two, three.

606
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
One, two, three.

607
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
One, two, three.

608
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
One, two, three.

609
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
One, two, three.

610
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
One, two, three.

611
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
One, two, three.

612
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
One, two, three.

613
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
One, two, three.

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
One, two, three.

615
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
One, two, three.

616
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
One, two, three.

617
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
One, two, three.

618
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
One, two, three.

619
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
One, two, three.

620
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
One, two, three.

621
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
One, two, three.

622
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
One, two, three.

623
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
One, two, three.

624
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
One, two, three.

625
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
One, two, three.

626
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
One, two, three.

627
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
One, two, three.

628
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
One, two, three.

629
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
One, two, three.

630
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
One, two, three.

631
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
One, two, three.

632
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
One, two, three.

633
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
One, two, three.

634
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
One, two, three.

635
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
One, two, three.

636
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
One, two, three.

637
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
One, two, three.

638
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
One, two, three.

639
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
One, two, three.

640
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
One, two, three.

641
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
One, two, three.

642
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
One, two, three.

643
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
It's not the oldest person in Paul McCunney.

644
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
It's bad.

645
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,040
You know, however, they don't go to the stones.

646
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Where is that SBC?

647
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Or is it?

648
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
I can watch it from the condo.

649
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
That's a whole thing.

650
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
You can act by Battalica.

651
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
And it's opening open.

652
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
You can act by Ever Claire.

653
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Oh, my God.

654
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
My goal is to visit Ever Claire.

655
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Ever Claire is pretty good, though.

656
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Are they?

657
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Yeah.

658
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
I don't think I can stand that much for...

659
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
You know, that's too much music.

660
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Well, I like it.

661
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
It's going to be very heavy, dude.

662
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
Battalica.

663
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
I think he's good at it.

664
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Haven't seen the booming.

665
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I want to see the booming.

666
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
I want to see the booming.

667
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Yeah.

668
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
Yeah, that would be good.

669
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
I did everyone that in Mike Bravo, kind of.

670
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Yeah.

671
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
He was a very early days of on-ramp.

672
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
We did the most nice polar beach party.

673
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Yeah.

674
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,040
And we did a CUCD video and aggressive networks audio.

675
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
You remember those?

676
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
There is.

677
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
From T.O.T.

678
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,040
In the northwest Territory, it's the inside the Arctic Circle.

679
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
And the prize was a hundred winners.

680
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Went to go up there.

681
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
And performances were by a hole,

682
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
which is Courtney Love.

683
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Yeah.

684
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
The Rucas Salt.

685
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
If you remember them, the end of Calica.

686
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
So it was us, the Calica.

687
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,040
And a hundred prize winners inside the Arctic Circle.

688
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,040
It was one of the most bizarre things of ever-witnesses.

689
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
See, you're talking about like that.

690
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
The streaming stuff, right?

691
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah.

692
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,040
You know, for a decade, everybody is streaming.

693
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,040
You know, so much of podcasting isn't to do.

694
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
So much of it's been done before.

695
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,040
And, you know, there was a really important show yesterday.

696
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
David Ford was there, much further along.

697
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,040
And we're talking about how, you know, we've all done this stuff before,

698
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
but I think he's right.

699
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Why didn't it stick?

700
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Why?

701
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Because you were connected to the computer.

702
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
You had to be able to disconnect.

703
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Think that for me?

704
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah.

705
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Because when it worked.

706
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,040
But the idea was real time and not portable.

707
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Yeah.

708
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I mean, the iPod disrupted.

709
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,040
That really disrupted the music business.

710
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,040
And it disrupted satellite radio as well, by the way,

711
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
because that's told me what those guys are planning on.

712
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Just give people commercial free, genre-based music channels

713
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
that they can listen to during drive time.

714
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
And have different types of musical formats.

715
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
And the iPod essentially gave that.

716
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
And then with the...

717
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
And then with the...

718
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
You know, they're bigger than us.

719
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
And the listener and control of that.

720
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
And people were just using these iPods.

721
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
I'm sure it's during drive time,

722
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
which is where radio makes all its money.

723
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
The morning drive and afternoon drive.

724
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
And it was the disconnecting from the unit

725
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
that really made it work.

726
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
So this portability.

727
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Come on.

728
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
That's what the AM transistor radio was back in the day.

729
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Christchurch.

730
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I mean, we don't have it.

731
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Don't use percentage.

732
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,040
One of the listeners are drive time and exercise time.

733
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
And it's working just three.

734
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
If you don't get it, don't get it.

735
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Right?

736
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
No.

737
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Precisely.

738
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,040
And is there a need, though, to take something like screaming

739
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
where you can't actually produce.

740
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Bill time content.

741
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
And bring that into podcast.

742
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
You can broadcast it.

743
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
You want it with an easy way of getting it.

744
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Just got to really concentrate too.

745
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Because I'm sorry.

746
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
I think it's like that.

747
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
It's streaming.

748
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
It's real time.

749
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
And that hasn't, you know,

750
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
there are times when that's really useful.

751
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
Like the Everwood.

752
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
You remember hurting the train?

753
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
And they're all these podcasts.

754
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
They're pretty good content.

755
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
They're pretty good content.

756
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
They're pretty good content.

757
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
They're pretty good content.

758
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
That wasn't sending me in now.

759
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Because they needed to broadcast real time.

760
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Right.

761
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Well, my feeling is that the infrastructure of transmitters and broadcast hours

762
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
does have a definite place.

763
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
I don't know if you'll get it.

764
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
It's a good company.

765
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Extremely broad cultural events.

766
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,040
So my cultural, I mean, it's something that we all witness simultaneously.

767
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
I don't know if they can't.

768
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Easily.

769
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Wherever we are, or if you don't have to have a computer,

770
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,040
we'll also be offshore through streams.

771
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,040
But, you know, when we find a summer been loaded,

772
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
yeah, in a couple days,

773
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
I'll want to listen to podcasts.

774
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,040
I'll be interested in you with people saying about it.

775
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
But, what's something's happening live?

776
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
Well, like, life sporting event.

777
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Something that, you know, that takes that kind of cultural presence within our lives.

778
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I think that's a beautiful thing.

779
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,040
And radio is fundamentally,

780
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,040
perfectly suited to create that.

781
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
And, you know, that's like,

782
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,040
usually it's when disasters are taking place.

783
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
In fact, TV news already does this.

784
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
What they do really well is when something big happens,

785
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
and everyone wants to see what's going on.

786
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
They're there. They're on the ground.

787
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
They're producing.

788
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
They're not fast cameras get to places.

789
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
And in the rest of the time, when there's no immediacy,

790
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
they fill it up with dribbling crap.

791
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,040
But I think we're trying to find a figure getting that out.

792
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Oh, and this is the not-news portion.

793
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
And then we switch over live to the guy I'm,

794
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
near what's happening.

795
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
That's something that, you know,

796
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
we'll talk about tomorrow, you know,

797
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
because I'm going to be want to talk to you about,

798
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,040
but what I saw last night at CNN at the water cooler,

799
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
and with the staggered,

800
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,040
or the time delayed,

801
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
and in my class,

802
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,040
you never get that water cooler effectively.

803
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Now, there's one other thing.

804
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
There's one other thing that's going on.

805
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
And that's, and it's a hyper-challenge.

806
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
And it has to rock show the head.

807
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Yeah.

808
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Yeah.

809
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
And podcasts are doing a pretty good job of that.

810
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Well, you have a correlate type of show.

811
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Yeah.

812
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
It is a street that we don't find to a small audience.

813
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
But it's interactable.

814
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Yeah.

815
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
It's, you're right on there.

816
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
It's a great year, right on.

817
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
From barge on it's completely,

818
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
we do a lot of that with private and they're down to the tangent.

819
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
It's a bit like a zombie-serer.

820
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
But we'll get,

821
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,040
it's about 100-word ratio between the live audience

822
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
and the art demand on it.

823
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Yeah.

824
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
And I think those numbers have helped up

825
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
remarkably well for over two years.

826
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,040
In fact, David worked with me on our first live street,

827
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,040
which was a check in February of, oh, fourth.

828
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Right.

829
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,040
And anyway, that 100-word ratio is pretty common.

830
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,040
I said, again, it seems that it takes yesterday

831
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,040
that I put it out to the audience,

832
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
but there's only represented one percent.

833
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
So a lot of you see what was going on right now.

834
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Yeah, and I think that you'll find the same ratio

835
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:15,040
with people who will call in on live radio talk shows

836
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
is probably 10 percent of the audience

837
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
and the ones to get in on the action

838
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
and the other 90 percent are passive.

839
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
So I think that model carries through, as you say,

840
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
precisely right.

841
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Michael Butler does that, where he streams

842
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,040
and he has an extra bonus, he has a chat room.

843
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Right.

844
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
So while people are talking and it's being recorded

845
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
for the podcast, people listening to the live stream

846
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,720
and there's live commenting going on

847
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,520
like a whole back channel on and I have.

848
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
I think he works very well.

849
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,440
He was walking and even a ten pounder one,

850
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,840
he never tells the person,

851
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,140
if that is ready to what he needs when it comes to what he needs.

852
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,040
If you have bullshitting, you can wrap up

853
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,240
when you're doing the live business,

854
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,440
thinking he is all about the camera system there now.

855
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,440
Right.

856
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,920
emissions decreasing.

857
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,940
Five-h告 take.

858
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,980
So that approach you 1-1,

859
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:34,980
One, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight, one, eight,

860
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:52,460
one,yeah that's not a good one. Yeah, that's not solid only's a question, that's not a good one. Five, five, nine, one, seven, about one. Spacious, five, eighth, five, five, six, six, five, seven, eight, eight, nine, eight, five, five, nine, six, seven, eight, five, five, six, seven, seven, eight, eight, eight, eight, nine, eight, seven, seven, eight, eight, seven, ten, ten, six, seven, seven, four, eight, six, eight, eight, seven, eight, six,

861
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,460
It's a tent of these chains, guys.

862
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Wow, big chains.

863
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,460
It's like we're playing between two high pressure zones.

864
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,460
So pretty, you can see whether the thing goes clear.

865
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,460
All right, let's get back down to what is out well, fine.

866
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
You said it.

867
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
He said it.

868
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
He said it.

869
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,460
So let's talk about, like, we should point out that we've got a first

870
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,460
first of the plane that's George.

871
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
George, you're all about it.

872
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,460
Oh, yeah, well, yeah.

873
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,460
George, it makes us able to spark up the duty and drink the beer.

874
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,460
Here we go.

875
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
And look, I just don't drop your action to beer.

876
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
I just don't have to take it down.

877
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,460
Right.

878
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,460
Let's talk about monetization.

879
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,460
I want to hear you guys thoughts on what you heard at the expo

880
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,460
and what your personal thoughts are.

881
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,460
No, no, it's a huge topic this year.

882
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
Yeah, man.

883
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,460
But they're really chiming in these.

884
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
One of them was.

885
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460
Oh, it's good.

886
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,460
Oh, it's good.

887
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,460
Well, generally revenue by, you know, somehow.

888
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,460
People that advertise and what I'm doing.

889
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,460
And how do I generate revenue by, like, here's the podcast.

890
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,460
They're going to have an opportunity to have a bit more

891
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
impactful content.

892
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,460
And he would interesting to see that come out about a lot of people.

893
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,460
So, or also, they're really passionate about what they're doing.

894
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,460
So, I think they're looking for a way to easily

895
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,460
re-revenue the same way that ad works.

896
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,460
A lot of them easily create revenue on their website.

897
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,460
But it's not actually the focus.

898
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,460
I don't know.

899
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,460
For everybody.

900
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
A lot of people are into the content.

901
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,460
There was, I think, more to that.

902
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,460
Both the interesting observations was a sequence of four,

903
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
we know.

904
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,460
First, you know, with Jason Keller, Kevin.

905
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Weblogging, right?

906
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,460
Yep, yep.

907
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
Okay.

908
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,460
It's easy. It's all about content.

909
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,460
It doesn't.

910
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
It doesn't.

911
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Yeah, it doesn't.

912
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
Mike, Jason, are not.

913
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,460
So, for truth, I don't know what you're doing.

914
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,460
And so, he had some harsh words to say for podcasts,

915
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,460
but I guess we should pay a full hope for things.

916
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
Yep.

917
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
The second was, we over-pushed.

918
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,460
The over-pushed was that you don't make this week a living

919
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,460
from all of what he does, but it's huge for all of you.

920
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,460
It's a catchy day, and all of you don't have time to listen.

921
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,460
But we live as in podcasts with so much pressure,

922
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
whatever it is.

923
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,460
If we have to keep it that way.

924
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,460
And there was angel for this week

925
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,460
who thinks of the promise that he hits me a lot

926
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,460
along the way, by the way.

927
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,460
All right. I did, I missed a, I missed a single month.

928
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,460
And to think about that, presentation.

929
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,460
There's just a lot of people who think about it.

930
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,460
Pleasure to meet you.

931
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
Is this, is this individuality in a word?

932
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,460
Yeah.

933
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
Well, the word for this.

934
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,460
It's a little bit of a...

935
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
No, real.

936
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Well, she was showing content in that whatever way he's going to be.

937
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,460
25 or older.

938
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,460
I don't know if I'm going to send a one, two, five, one.

939
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,460
Just if the set is one, nine.

940
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
That's a single week.

941
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
It's worth it.

942
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
She was passionate about this, by the way.

943
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
I think that people crossed the question.

944
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
And for the end of the day.

945
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,460
Yeah.

946
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,460
I thought I would give.

947
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,460
I mean, I got a lot of confidence about it.

948
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
I wasn't lucky enough to be on living.

949
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
He don't have to ever.

950
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,460
Because that was a personal story.

951
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,460
The topic of that.

952
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,460
And of course, playing was all about a lot of confidence.

953
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Right.

954
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,460
So we had four fairly, fairly different monetization perspectives.

955
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,460
Just as those work, you know.

956
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
But David Wright, he wasn't huge.

957
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,460
He was talking to David.

958
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,460
He was talking to me.

959
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
He was talking to me.

960
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
He was talking to me.

961
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
He was talking to me.

962
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,460
He was talking to me.

963
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
He was talking to me.

964
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
He was talking to me.

965
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,460
He was talking to me.

966
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
He was talking to me.

967
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,460
Well, let me take a stab at this from my vantage point.

968
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
And we were.

969
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,460
I was at the expo to people.

970
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,460
But also to sign people to our network.

971
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,460
And to explain to them what that means.

972
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,460
And although I'm not against an ad words.

973
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Maple monetization scheme.

974
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,460
Here's really what I believe most of this is going.

975
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,460
First of all, we all agree that what's happening in podcasting is the relationship

976
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,460
between the podcast and the audience.

977
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Yeah.

978
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,460
That's the thing that's special.

979
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Because these people are tuning in not because it's 18 to 34 year old content.

980
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,460
No, it's because there's a connection there, which I've done radio a lot.

981
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,460
Doug, you've done radio.

982
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,460
When you have that connection with your audience, you know what it is.

983
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,460
So when I think of the daily source code with several hundred thousand listeners.

984
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,460
To me, I feel that I know those listeners personally.

985
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,460
And in many cases, I do.

986
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,460
And they talk to me.

987
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,460
And we have a dialogue, which builds up Gmail and feedback comments.

988
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,460
And it's all kinds of ways that I have the relationship.

989
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,460
If it were radio, I think, okay, I'm reaching like 100,000 people in New York.

990
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
You know, that would be a very different vibe.

991
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:40,460
So I predict that advertisers, and this is advertisers, we're the ones that we're missing from this conference.

992
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,460
I think that there's a huge opportunity to miss.

993
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,460
You know, we're talking to a lot of them.

994
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,460
In fact, I'm speaking with Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday.

995
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,460
They're all the brand managers at media buyers at Seattle.

996
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:06,460
I predict that advertisers will have to audition the podcasters to carry their product service or message.

997
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,460
Because only the podcaster and this is where we're taking it.

998
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,460
Only the podcaster really knows if something's going to be appropriate for you to offer their audience.

999
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Whether I talk about Senseo and get paid nothing for it, or if I talk about Apple and get paid nothing for it,

1000
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
I'll talk about it.

1001
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,460
I want to take MM50 or a wireless headset.

1002
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,460
It's my responsibility for it's my audience to only give them things that they'll be interested in or that will, you know,

1003
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
or what is appropriate for our relationship.

1004
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,460
So I'm going to give you a quick, a little interview, or a little interview.

1005
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,460
A little interview, a little interview, a little interview.

1006
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,460
The advertisers will have to audition to be on.

1007
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,460
They'll have to audition to the podcaster because the podcaster represents his or her audience.

1008
00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:01,460
And the podcaster here is particularly true in your case where the emotional messages are delivering to your voice literally.

1009
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,460
Yeah, as opposed to they produce the pod.

1010
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,460
And I think there is a place for a plot to you by message.

1011
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,460
I think there's a place for that.

1012
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,460
But what's much more exciting and much more valuable and cannot be eaten down into, you know,

1013
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,460
CPM or the cost for reaching 1000 listeners is really that relationship.

1014
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,460
When I talk about the logic tech MM50 and someone sends me an email and says,

1015
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,460
Dude, I bought it because you said I should check it out.

1016
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,460
And I like it, but I have a couple of comments.

1017
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,460
Can please send them back to logic tech and make the product better.

1018
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,460
That's a very, very valuable relationship.

1019
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,460
I don't want to get something from the guy who told me he bought it for savings,

1020
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
because I like the conversations.

1021
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
Right, you know.

1022
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,460
All right, he worked for the $50.

1023
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,460
It is, absolutely, absolutely.

1024
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,460
So it's that special relationship that's going on.

1025
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:58,460
Now the people that I met who made it over to the pod show, eat ups, entrepreneurs.

1026
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:05,460
You know, a lot of wine casters were interested in what we can do with them on the network.

1027
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:15,460
And these people are already, you know, talking to California officials about the $10 million

1028
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,460
budget that is spent on promoting wine.

1029
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,460
And all they want is someone to help them and to manage it and to bring opportunities to them.

1030
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,460
But they make all the decisions.

1031
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,460
Right.

1032
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,460
And they determine what they're going to do, how they're going to do it, how long they're going to do it.

1033
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,460
And if they're going to do it at all.

1034
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,460
And for us, it's like great.

1035
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,460
Well, coming to come back to that question,

1036
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,460
editorial and editorial person advertising content.

1037
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,460
What you're saying is there really isn't much of a separation if you don't go.

1038
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,460
As you see at that, advertising will only be brought in when there is some editorial control.

1039
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,460
It's something to us.

1040
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,460
Yeah.

1041
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:05,460
I mean, that's the hole for the filters that you have to put in place when there is someone else who has

1042
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
ultimate responsibility over the product.

1043
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
Doesn't work.

1044
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,460
That's the thing that went away is like, I can say whatever on on my podcast.

1045
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,460
And the only bad thing that can happen is I shouldn't mind forcing me to put an explicit tag on it.

1046
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
But that's not too bad.

1047
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,460
I wonder if that is a facade of early stage.

1048
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Can you go back?

1049
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,460
I think television is a great deal.

1050
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,460
Where?

1051
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,460
Where do you go to?

1052
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
I'm your writer.

1053
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Where are your friends passing with all over the show itself?

1054
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:40,460
The difference there does is that it still was a broadcast corporation on show.

1055
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,460
It was based upon 30 second or a minute increments.

1056
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,460
Still, I mean, the live reads were still limited in time at that point.

1057
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,460
And I'm now let's change advertising.

1058
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
What the hell was advertising?

1059
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,460
How does it work?

1060
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Let's figure that out.

1061
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:04,460
And that's not going to be some network or directory of podcasts who's going to figure that out.

1062
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,460
With all respect, it's not a matching service.

1063
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,460
If you like this, you'll like that.

1064
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,460
That is what the podcasts are going to figure out.

1065
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,460
They're going to figure out together with very, very motivated advertisers.

1066
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,460
But these are $2 billion worth of attractive advertising.

1067
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,460
They can $27 billion of radio advertising.

1068
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,460
These radio advertisers are jumping up and down.

1069
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,460
They're finally at their turn.

1070
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,460
And I guess what?

1071
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,460
We're not limited to 30 second blocks.

1072
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,460
Let's do something new.

1073
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,460
Three, four, two, eight.

1074
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,460
Both here we are.

1075
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,460
I think that's right.

1076
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,460
Thank you.

1077
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
I think it will be a follow.

1078
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,460
I think I suggest to tell people for a lot of variation.

1079
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,460
I don't get our handwork.

1080
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
I think that's fine.

1081
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,460
They're going to get it.

1082
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
They're going to get it.

1083
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,460
If you think you're moving on there, you know, we're going to put it on the pot.

1084
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,460
Yeah.

1085
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
If you're going to put it on the pot.

1086
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1087
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1088
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1089
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1090
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1091
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1092
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1093
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:10,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1094
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1095
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1096
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1097
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1098
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1099
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,460
If you're going to put it on the pot, you're going to put it on the pot.

1100
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,460
Just in contrast, instead of saying, send the money, help me keep keep me on the air.

1101
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,460
It's like wireless radio.

1102
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,740
What overpop you have? Are you going to be away from cheer but in a way, the way that you are

1103
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,460
mixing a包, does means it's not going to happen for some reason.

1104
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,460
That's not going to happen for some reason.

1105
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,460
Well, it is borazony.

1106
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,460
There are papakyca palpio1.

1107
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,460
People who are believed losing their Firma,

1108
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,460
That, for me, could be a stronger than the relationship of aeropartic systems.

1109
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,460
And we can do that.

1110
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,460
You know, we have the benefit of having a drive,

1111
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,460
something to take it get behind.

1112
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,460
And that's what we appeal to with that stuff.

1113
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,460
You know, we've got to somebody like a guy who would say,

1114
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,460
you know, what do you like to be associated with this?

1115
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,460
I can't say, it's not a good one, two, three, four.

1116
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,460
And the guy who can say, you know,

1117
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,460
yeah, we don't value it just because it's going to be fine.

1118
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,460
It's not in trying to get a deeper surface of your cross.

1119
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,460
Sure.

1120
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,460
It seems like there's a couple different models here.

1121
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,460
There's always a split in average.

1122
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,460
I take my own five way.

1123
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,460
Yeah, they're not 10,000.

1124
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,460
That one has hits that comes across in the pot.

1125
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
Yeah.

1126
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,460
And then there's also a sponsor for leadership.

1127
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,460
For example, MPR has a sponsorship for MACRA.

1128
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,460
And it's pretty lightweight.

1129
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,460
It's a sense that it appears on their website and it appears

1130
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,460
there's, you know, this podcast is brought to you by accurate.

1131
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,460
And that's pretty much it.

1132
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,460
There's, and then there's, there's definitely more tentative.

1133
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,460
Like you look at the solution of radio.

1134
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,460
There's messages every couple minutes.

1135
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,460
I wonder where this, I mean, it seems like a lot of different things will

1136
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,460
end up happening where people are going to take sponsors

1137
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,460
to people are going to set up bad networks.

1138
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,460
And we know it's what other things will fall.

1139
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,460
But I'm wondering a little bit where I feel

1140
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,460
when I went to wherever it fell, I think.

1141
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,460
A lot of things are going to come from.

1142
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,460
We're about to get over it with the change I predict.

1143
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,460
I guess I'm slightly going to see if it was more important.

1144
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,460
I'm about to cross over and make this field.

1145
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,460
But that's where it goes.

1146
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,460
Yep.

1147
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,460
Well, I'm just radically going to make it.

1148
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,460
Yeah.

1149
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,460
Overall, never go to Ontario again.

1150
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,460
It's just going to be around $20.

1151
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,460
Yeah, they're engine.

1152
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,460
Dude, we paid $40 a landing in Europe.

1153
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,460
What are you pitching about?

1154
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,460
I don't know.

1155
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,460
I'd rather than like paying $250 a landing fee.

1156
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,460
Yeah.

1157
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,460
Yeah.

1158
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,460
Yeah.

1159
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,460
Yeah.

1160
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,460
It's good to get those contact pairs for the first one.

1161
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,460
Two, six, five, four, five.

1162
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,460
Well, verbally, I mean, the first, I think,

1163
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,460
and what I was just thinking of dollar is the fourth time.

1164
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,460
It's going to work a year to play now.

1165
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,460
It's going to work a year to play now.

1166
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,460
It's going to work a year to play now.

1167
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,460
It's going to work.

1168
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,460
Yeah.

1169
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,460
It's going to work.

1170
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,460
Yeah.

1171
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,460
It's going to give you the same thing.

1172
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,460
Well, guys.

1173
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,460
I think I like another, uh,

1174
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,460
I think I've been into here.

1175
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,460
I'll just pick that up.

1176
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,460
You went the podcast.

1177
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,460
Yeah.

1178
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,460
It's been really, really fun way to talk about stuff.

1179
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,460
It kills some time and burns a fuel.

1180
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,460
Yeah.

1181
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,460
It takes the plank.

1182
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,460
Well, what do you think?

1183
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,460
We tend to stay for more than a decade.

1184
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,460
Yeah.

1185
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,460
Yeah.

1186
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,460
That's probably the half of contact pairs for the pro-point.

1187
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,460
Yeah.

1188
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,460
So it takes the first time they're communicated with the sexerize rate.

1189
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,460
Yeah.

1190
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,460
Yeah.

1191
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,460
That's probably even another spot for them.

1192
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,460
Yeah.

1193
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,460
Alright.

1194
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,460
Sam Ahar.

1195
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,460
Yeah.

1196
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,460
Bob, I think that's very sweet to Svenger.

1197
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,460
Out coming on through to our Maserlov.

1198
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,460
Come on.

1199
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
There you go.

1200
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,460
Two eight, and too for three or five more minutes ahead.

1201
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,460
Let's see if we can find a possible way.

1202
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,460
Without a full five.

1203
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,460
Hello.

1204
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,460
And like 265, you can't take that on when you're pulling.

1205
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,460
If you're stuck on it.

1206
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
Yeah.

1207
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,460
There's 1, 9, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8.

1208
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,460
Okay.

1209
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,460
So I had this idea for a show where we take a guest up in the end.

1210
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,460
We fly with it when we just talk.

1211
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,460
We can do that.

1212
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,460
Especially with a couple of watch this.

1213
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,460
Yeah.

1214
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,460
Yeah.

1215
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,460
Watch this.

1216
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,460
Hey.

1217
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,460
Oh.

1218
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,460
Do you like aerobatics?

1219
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,460
Yeah.

1220
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,460
I wonder, yeah.

1221
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,460
I wonder what you'd like with sound fun.

1222
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,460
Oh.

1223
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,460
You know, what was that?

1224
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,460
Great line.

1225
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,460
You know.

1226
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,460
I wonder if somebody was like, you know, have you ever been to a gym?

1227
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,460
What's the life of airplane?

1228
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,460
Be able to see the girl man thinking.

1229
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,460
There's great lines from here.

1230
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,460
Oh, yeah.

1231
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Airplane is so pretty one more.

1232
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,460
Would you please complete the joke?

1233
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,460
Yeah.

1234
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,460
Roger over.

1235
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,460
Thank you for your active liquor.

1236
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,460
That's right.

1237
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,460
Yeah.

1238
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,460
Exactly.

1239
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,460
All right.

1240
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,460
All right.

1241
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,460
So we got how much longer to run into.

1242
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,460
We've got one hour or 11 minutes to where it's open.

1243
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,460
Oh, man.

1244
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,460
We could almost do a second podcast.

1245
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,460
So we could do, uh, I think it'll be interesting.

1246
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,460
I can listen to the big approach on the way down.

1247
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,460
Because there's a lot of traffic.

1248
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,460
But I thought they have to go to this.

1249
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,460
Okay.

1250
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,460
And I'm going to leave the lag.

1251
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,460
I'm going to pause this now.

1252
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,460
And I'm going to leave the last couple of, uh, uh, couple of minutes for the approach.

1253
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,460
But I think we can totally say that, uh, podcasts, that's what we're supposed to.

1254
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,460
Yeah.

1255
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,460
It's a lot of fun.

1256
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,460
Right on.

1257
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,460
Certainly was.

1258
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,460
All right.

1259
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,460
Stay tuned for our final approach.

1260
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,460
For, uh, today's daily sports going back at an hour.

1261
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,460
Yeah.

1262
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,460
And infinity.

1263
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,460
So what I'm going to do now is, uh, we're down to 1 minute and 10 seconds.

1264
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Right?

1265
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,460
Yeah.

1266
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,460
And I know what I'll do is, uh, I'm recording now.

1267
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,460
We're back.

1268
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,460
Okay.

1269
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,460
Everybody, uh, Doug just, uh, called in that he has an extra vision.

1270
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,460
And it's a long, a long explanation as to how that came from.

1271
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,460
Uh, but if you listen to this on a serious satellite.

1272
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,460
Stars channel.

1273
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,460
Uh, you're going to miss out on all the good stuff.

1274
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,460
Uh, those are you listening to the podcast.

1275
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,460
I'm going to get the entire approach down into, uh, open the airport.

1276
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,460
We'll just keep this running.

1277
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,460
So, it's all of you on serious.

1278
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,460
Dubai.

1279
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,460
It's been fun.

1280
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,460
It's been fun.

1281
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,460
It sounds a lot of fun.

1282
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,460
It's not a Charlie.

1283
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,460
It's been two.

1284
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,460
What's wrong?

1285
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,460
The original profile, Charlie.

1286
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,460
No, no, no.

1287
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,460
All right.

1288
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,460
Just send down a photo of two, three zero.

1289
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,460
They're in cross show.

1290
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,460
I'd mean, here, one, two, out.

1291
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,460
I'm stuck in our perimeter.

1292
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,460
Three, zero, two, six.

1293
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,460
Hey, you want to send it two, three, zero, sorry.

1294
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,460
And one, three, thousand.

1295
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,460
Pralochos.

1296
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,460
There's probably, shall it 12,000, it's sharp.

1297
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,460
We'll think about the truck.

1298
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,460
We have, like, 20 minutes, 15 minutes left.

1299
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,460
We have, just seven, 60 seconds.

1300
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,460
I can do it.

1301
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,460
I'm going to spot the final.

1302
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,460
Of course, let's go.

1303
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,460
I'm going to spot the final.

1304
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,460
Then the, uh, figure is seven, seven, six.

1305
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,460
I want to put on top of a 10-tick thing.

1306
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,460
Number six, three, Charlie.

1307
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,460
Charlie, come here.

1308
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,460
I'll see you last one.

1309
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,460
I'll see you last one.

1310
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,460
Currently at the door.

1311
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,460
And we have an echron.

1312
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,460
We have a hole.

1313
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,460
I'm going to do it.

1314
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,460
I'm going to do it.

1315
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,460
Let's go.

1316
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,460
We have something to talk about.

1317
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,460
What's that phrase?

1318
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,460
Why?

1319
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,460
Yes.

1320
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,460
Power support.

1321
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,460
What do we do about it?

1322
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,460
We do a eight o'clock.

1323
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,460
It could be a seven, thirty-eight other.

1324
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,460
Half out of nine.

1325
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,460
For seven.

1326
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,460
Think about the clock.

1327
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,460
Now we're starting to do the clock.

1328
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,460
I mean, it's certainly here.

1329
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,460
It's here.

1330
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,460
But still, they're here.

1331
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,460
They've been charging me out.

1332
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,460
Don't come up the road.

1333
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,460
A lot of air traffic is booted up.

1334
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,460
It's something.

1335
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,460
Another two.

1336
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,460
This time.

1337
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,460
That's enough.

1338
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,460
We've got the upper feet.

1339
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,460
They can see their cioè board shortly.

1340
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,460
In the middle of the crowd and from those client rooms.

1341
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,460
Twenty-one, twenty-one plus three.

1342
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,460
Fifteen-four, twenty-one.

1343
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,460
Pass.

1344
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,460
Yep, right.

1345
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:06,460
You can see the three-robble into the corrective.

1346
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,460
Talk to us.

1347
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,460
Passed out of two.

1348
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,460
An eight- tight五.

1349
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,460
Eight-1 and it's zero.

1350
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,460
Baint sand, a light a hole.

1351
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:27,460
You know, American 112, but 1,600 per flat south.

1352
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,460
Oh.

1353
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:38,460
American 112, North County parts of the river concept.

1354
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:44,460
And you need to give you right turning 185,000, so you have a 2.6.

1355
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,460
Yeah.

1356
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,460
And they're making fun.

1357
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,460
We've done our turn now.

1358
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,460
And I'm trying this in the second half.

1359
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,460
In the American 112, he's saying, you know, I say, you ought to keep pointing.

1360
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,460
Jack, we're at 2.3 right now.

1361
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,460
We're turning right Jack.

1362
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,460
I'm at a 5,000.

1363
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,460
I'm in the river into a 2.45.

1364
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,460
I'm out of the class.

1365
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,460
He's working loose.

1366
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
I don't know.

1367
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,460
I'm going to really have your key.

1368
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,460
Don't do that.

1369
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,460
I can't even show you.

1370
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,460
He's hurting.

1371
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,460
I can't even show you.

1372
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,460
He's hurting.

1373
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,460
I can't even show you.

1374
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,460
I can't even show you.

1375
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,460
I can't even show you.

1376
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,460
I can't even show you.

1377
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,460
I can't even show you.

1378
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,460
If you look at the mountain range, see if that would be logical.

1379
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Yeah.

1380
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,460
You know, it's going right over.

1381
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,460
We're going to go.

1382
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,460
If we're going to have a 5,000hp for our capital family,

1383
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,460
1007 1008 1008 and we're going to have a 3,000hp.

1384
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,460
Now for some reason though, but the ocean still are.

1385
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,460
It's cold.

1386
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,460
If we're going to go 1007 1008 1008 1008, we're going to have a 4,000hp.

1387
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,460
We're going to do a 2,000hp.

1388
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,460
I have 2,000hp.

1389
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,460
If we're going to go another 1,000hp, we're going to have a 5,000hp.

1390
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,460
But if we're going to go another 1,000hp, we're going to have a 5,000hp.

1391
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,280
So remember, pay 10 or below 3000, 100,

1392
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,460
to pay 8,000 to pay 30 away.

1393
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,660
I know it's not clean on the 500,

1394
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,580
the main one, so it's not clean enough.

1395
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,860
I'm gonna do it yourself.

1396
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,900
It's like plus wind turbulence almost.

1397
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,720
Yeah.

1398
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,900
Thank you, take care of your tail.

1399
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,740
Good old.

1400
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,580
Let's go home, man.

1401
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,420
Got him.

1402
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,580
This is a very comfortable plane Dougs, very nice.

1403
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,580
Thank you for coming to our airport.

1404
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,140
There are three, one, four, and here we go.

1405
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:13,980
Right here we go.

1406
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,980
Right here we go.

1407
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,180
That is the back seat.

1408
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,580
The housing now.

1409
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
It's actually a 60-year plane that the last

1410
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,420
seats are removed.

1411
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,060
So it's a bit disappointing for people

1412
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,020
for a fixed-point 11 guy,

1413
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,460
and we're going to have to ride that 517 at the 1.5.

1414
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,020
That's very nice.

1415
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,780
Is there a period of a period of a period?

1416
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,460
But also the angle of the seat is nice.

1417
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,460
It's a practical one that can hold it out.

1418
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,460
And there are a period of 18 out of a lot of times.

1419
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,020
I can see a little bit of stuff in there.

1420
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,300
And that is going to be a lot.

1421
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,380
Like you are kind of right here.

1422
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,580
I've got a back-on now.

1423
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,780
So I'm walking 17, 17, 17, 17.

1424
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,300
You're very nice and you can take my name out of the 1.0.

1425
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,740
When I take my flight just, I remember

1426
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,740
at 0-8's mic here.

1427
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:58,620
1.0, contact cross 1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5.

1428
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,580
When it's more 52, the 90's left here.

1429
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,820
When they 54, no, I've got to cross your radar contact.

1430
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,820
You may be getting your right turn.

1431
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,580
I'd be going to go down to the road for a while.

1432
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,780
I think not pilots would not be taking that so dangerous.

1433
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,740
Who is your favorite driver?

1434
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,180
No, I wouldn't have been the 911.

1435
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,180
I would have been the 911.

1436
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,740
I would have been the 911.

1437
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,900
Unfortunately, the best of us are used to it.

1438
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,900
And right.

1439
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,900
Exactly.

1440
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,900
Good.

1441
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,900
Good.

1442
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,900
Good.

1443
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,900
Good.

1444
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,900
Good.

1445
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,900
Good.

1446
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,900
Good.

1447
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,900
Good.

1448
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,900
Good.

1449
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,900
Good.

1450
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,900
Good.

1451
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,900
Good.

1452
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,900
Good.

1453
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,900
Good.

1454
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,900
Good.

1455
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,740
Good.

1456
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,740
I'm sorry.

1457
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,740
I didn't do anything.

1458
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,740
I thought you were a driver.

1459
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,740
I'm off the airport.

1460
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,740
I need to do it.

1461
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,740
I'm going to go down.

1462
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,740
I'm going to cross.

1463
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,740
I'm going to go down.

1464
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,740
I'm going to go down.

1465
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,740
I'm going to go down.

1466
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:52,740
The worst is when you put a person who's not used to it in the foot seat.

1467
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,740
Wait.

1468
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,740
Wait.

1469
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,740
And he has no idea.

1470
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,740
He was here.

1471
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,740
I feel like he didn't want to see you.

1472
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,740
No idea what it's like to fly through the lake.

1473
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,740
You were around in 40 miles now.

1474
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,740
Yeah.

1475
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,740
I'm free for now.

1476
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,740
I'm looking very well.

1477
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,740
It's like I've received it.

1478
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,740
Here we go.

1479
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,740
To the rooftop here.

1480
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,740
Oh.

1481
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,740
Extend your antenna, dude.

1482
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,740
It was for your family.

1483
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,740
It did be for another below 4,500 traffic.

1484
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,740
You want a clock.

1485
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,740
We were here 12 or 13 miles.

1486
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,740
Only 10.

1487
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:21,740
37,6,000.

1488
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,740
Because she's got a scroll.

1489
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,740
We're going to have to have a.

1490
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,740
So it's basically for fun and easy fun of a 1.0 0.

1491
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,740
Oh.

1492
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,740
And then I got a kiss like a horse.

1493
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,740
I got a bottle.

1494
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,740
If you wanted to.

1495
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,740
No.

1496
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,740
I'm good.

1497
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,740
Well, what's there?

1498
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,740
This would be the first point.

1499
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,740
This is the bottle.

1500
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,740
We're going to be able to play one.

1501
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,740
Exactly.

1502
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,740
I should give you the bottle.

1503
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,740
I go do that.

1504
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,740
That's cool.

1505
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,740
Let's piss in the bottle.

1506
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,740
Put your eyes back.

1507
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,740
It's a.

1508
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,740
I'll see you in the bottle behind my back.

1509
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,740
It's the podcast.

1510
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,740
Okay.

1511
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,740
I'm doing this for the show.

1512
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,740
I'm going to go.

1513
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,740
I'm going to go.

1514
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,740
I'm going to go.

1515
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,740
I'm going to go.

1516
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,740
I'm going to go.

1517
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,740
I'm going to go.

1518
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,740
I'm going to go.

1519
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,740
I'm going to go.

1520
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,740
I'm going to go.

1521
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,740
I'm going to go.

1522
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,740
I'm going to go.

1523
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,740
I'm going to go.

1524
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,740
I'm going to go.

1525
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,740
I'm going to go.

1526
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,740
I'm going to go.

1527
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,740
I'm going to go.

1528
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,740
I'm going to go.

1529
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,740
I'm going to go.

1530
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,740
I'm going to go.

1531
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,740
I'm going to go.

1532
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,740
I'm going to go.

1533
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,740
I'm going to go.

1534
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,740
I'm going to go.

1535
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,740
I'm going to go.

1536
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,740
I'm going to go.

1537
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,740
I'm going to go.

1538
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,740
I'm going to go.

1539
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:32,740
I'm going to go.

1540
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,740
I'll be going to go.

1541
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,740
I'll go.

1542
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,740
I'll go.

1543
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,740
I'll go.

1544
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,740
I'm going to go.

1545
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,740
I'm going to.

1546
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,740
I'm going.

1547
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,740
I'm going to go.

1548
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,740
I'll go.

1549
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:55,540
I'm going to M now, and I'm buckled for my seat.

1550
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,640
What's our altitude, Doug?

1551
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,980
I'd be fitting to 5,000, 4,000, and I was like,

1552
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,140
I'm plenty of time to do this.

1553
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,220
OK.

1554
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,980
So I need not quite my line, though.

1555
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,980
This is, OK.

1556
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,980
So this is, how could you describe this bottle?

1557
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,980
It's not, OK.

1558
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,260
It's red, which I believe that's not fun.

1559
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,220
You're not drinking now.

1560
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:19,700
OK, it's a, it's a, it kind of looks like a gourd, I guess.

1561
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,260
And has a screw top, which I'm not taking off.

1562
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,860
Oh, is the opening big enough?

1563
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,540
Ha ha ha.

1564
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,940
Anyhow, take it down.

1565
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,460
Is the deck long enough?

1566
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,740
I've seen, of course, I have, like, blue jeans.

1567
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,700
They have to, I'm buckled for everything.

1568
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,540
OK.

1569
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,580
Here, but you got the camera?

1570
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,020
Fuck you.

1571
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,180
Oh, here we go.

1572
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:37,940
Hold on.

1573
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,780
Now, I insert.

1574
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,540
Oh, my god.

1575
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,500
It's so wild.

1576
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,500
I'll look at the entire tank.

1577
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,500
I'll get the head.

1578
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,140
What if I had more than the bottle can hold?

1579
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,380
And we're all in trouble.

1580
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,980
Shit, man, maybe I shouldn't do it.

1581
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,100
It's 33, and I know you're going to have to look at your crazy,

1582
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:55,020
gravel airspace over or south of the beach or freeway.

1583
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,700
That's more below 3500.

1584
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,580
Don't be forced off the internet.

1585
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,780
Hey, Doug, I think I have more than this thing at home.

1586
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,380
I've got that.

1587
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,140
I'll look at you for the car, sure.

1588
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,940
You'll be short point five, too.

1589
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,300
OK.

1590
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,740
I know.

1591
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,500
Before five days, I thought they'd think too far.

1592
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,140
OK.

1593
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,140
Here we go.

1594
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:14,820
There you go.

1595
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,340
Come on, man.

1596
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,180
This is something.

1597
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,580
Oh, this feels so good.

1598
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,580
Yeah.

1599
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,780
Oh, yeah.

1600
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,980
So I'm on my knees, peeing into a bottle.

1601
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,180
We've had the book cast.

1602
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:27,980
So we got to go.

1603
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,180
This is the peeing cast.

1604
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,780
How many private airplanes can Adam pee in?

1605
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:36,780
Dude, this thing is really so enough, Doug.

1606
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,380
I'm not kidding.

1607
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,180
Remember, P.B.

1608
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,380
I'm a kind of approach on P.B.

1609
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,180
Fullware of point B.

1610
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,180
What if all right, Paul?

1611
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:55,180
There is quiet back here.

1612
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,180
I'm looking at this bottle filled up.

1613
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,180
And it's now almost to the stem of the bottle.

1614
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,180
I'm not kidding.

1615
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,180
This is not going to be funny if I have to hold back

1616
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,180
with a couple of arms.

1617
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,180
There's not the first podcast.

1618
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,180
That's been recorded on a toilet.

1619
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,180
There you go.

1620
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,180
No, but this is certainly a whole man.

1621
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,180
I'm into the neck of the thing.

1622
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,180
Yeah.

1623
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,180
It's, I'm sorry.

1624
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,180
I'm sorry.

1625
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,180
I'm sorry.

1626
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,180
I'm sorry.

1627
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,180
I'm sorry.

1628
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,180
I'm sorry.

1629
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,180
I'm sorry.

1630
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,180
I'm sorry.

1631
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,180
I'm sorry.

1632
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,180
I'm sorry.

1633
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,180
I'm sorry.

1634
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,180
I'm sorry.

1635
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,180
I'm sorry.

1636
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,180
Okay.

1637
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,180
I have to actually stop because the bottle is full.

1638
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,180
It didn't need to go.

1639
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,180
Yeah.

1640
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:46,180
This is now comes the tricky part of the bottle.

1641
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,180
Five…

1642
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,180
Three...

1643
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,180
Yeah.

1644
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,180
Yeah.

1645
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,180
So what is that?

1646
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,180
No.

1647
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,180
Four…

1648
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,180
Fifty five…

1649
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,180
Sorry.

1650
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,180
Four…

1651
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,180
Fifty five.

1652
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,180
Fifty few…

1653
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,180
Fifty 두� нос...

1654
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,180
Fifty ten films from the gym.

1655
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,180
Fifty five hundred.

1656
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,180
Fifty.

1657
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,180
Or secure the bottle.

1658
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,180
Fifty five hundred.

1659
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,780
you know, that's brought up a little bit better poster sometimes.

1660
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:25,180
Yeah here we are.

1661
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,180
What are the 5 out of an R-C-L-C-L-M-R-C-L?

1662
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,180
Can I go to the R-C-L-C-L-C-L?

1663
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,180
We can move forward with that, thank you.

1664
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,180
I wonder if there's a 5-0 on our count, Bro.

1665
00:59:36,180 --> 01:00:06,180
Can I go to the R-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-

1666
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,040
Ow. Gl ikgal type should have that eight.

1667
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,940
Where's the fourth End line?

1668
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:11,940
Yeah.

1669
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,520
Ok.

1670
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,520
Yeah!

1671
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,020
What's the point?

1672
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,540
I'm still on to the end of the Yellow L-C-L-C-L-C-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C-L-C.

1686
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,500
you might either

1687
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,500
I'll check my bike again.

1688
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,500
I'll have it to tell you three times now and you're not responding.

1689
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,500
I'm waiting to visit you.

1690
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,500
I want to talk to you, I'll just go.

1691
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,500
Southwest down.

1692
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,500
It's an half to get a 5,800.

1693
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,500
It's not too expensive.

1694
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,500
I'll take my bike.

1695
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,500
I'll just buy 15.

1696
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,500
I'll take my bike.

1697
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,500
I'll take my bike.

1698
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,500
Yeah, it's all the way to us, we're out there.

1699
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
All right, I'll just buy it.

1700
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,500
I'll just buy it.

1701
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,500
I'll just buy it.

1702
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,500
That was the record.

1703
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
That was a record.

1704
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
That was a record.

1705
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,500
I was probably probably probably probably probably probably

1706
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
probably probably probably probably probably, I've seen me at about 2,000,

1707
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,500
but there's no produce from a way to 9.

1708
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
Maybe we've cleared the visual for 2,000.

1709
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
Oh, it's got 60 mianters above 2,000.

1710
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,500
Probably.

1711
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,500
It's a 3,000.

1712
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
A 4,000, a 4,000, a 4,000, a 4,000, a 5,000.

1713
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
A 4,000, a 4,000, a 4,000, a 4,000, a 4,000.

1714
01:01:44,500 --> 01:02:02,500
If you take 3,000, a 4,000, a 4,000, a 4,000, a 5,000, a 4,000, a 5,000, a 5,000, a 5,000, a 5,000.

1715
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:07,500
And so a 3, 2,000 and a 6,000, a 5,000, a 5,000, a 5,000.

1716
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,500
Let's just go all right, let's just say that called prosduos at one.

1717
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,500
Then, I mentioned them.

1718
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
One we're just about 300 I guess.

1719
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Yeah, or but as straight man.

1720
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:22,820
That

1721
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,500
I think it's like the Redmi 8V is far out of a little 3,000 to 500.

1722
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,500
It's a 3,000 to 530.

1723
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,500
It's probably probably going to go in the power 1,000 to 7.2.

1724
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
20,000 to 0,000 out of getting it.

1725
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
So, I'm going to get you in 100,000.

1726
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,500
If you don't want to navigate, you can cross the team.

1727
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,500
Hey, we're dead above 2,000.

1728
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Normally, 2,000, right?

1729
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,500
I mean, hey, we're both above 2,000.

1730
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,500
We're going to do it up above 20,000.

1731
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
If you want to do it up above 20,000,

1732
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
then you can do it up with the 686.5,500.

1733
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,500
You might've noticed it had a heavy hit to us 500.

1734
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,500
We did it.

1735
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
5,5,000 to 5,000 more getting it up to 3,000.

1736
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,500
4-2.1.

1737
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,500
Up, I don't even want to do it.

1738
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,500
5.5 is one, two, three, 25, more than that.

1739
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,500
That's past 150,ron navigation.

1740
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,500
lanver has done one of the mainclapping teams.

1741
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,500
There are about 238.

1742
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,500
Officer, would you.

1743
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,500
Ok, so, we're...

1744
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,500
Street 6?

1745
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Oh, these are going for gay funds.

1746
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:34,500
Or it was called where he would have even he ordered 2,000 feet with a 70,000, 700,000.

1747
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
It was just a few miles before.

1748
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
And then find an automatic call to talk to him.

1749
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,500
He might have found out that it's 8,400.

1750
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,500
5,500.

1751
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
5,500.

1752
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,500
5,500.

1753
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,500
You think you do have it, do not?

1754
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,500
5,500.

1755
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,500
1,500.

1756
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,500
1,500.

1757
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,500
1,400.

1758
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,500
Did you make anything for him out here?

1759
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
4,500.

1760
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,500
2,500.

1761
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,500
2,500.

1762
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,500
1,500.

1763
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,500
1,500.

1764
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,500
6,600.

1765
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
8,500.

1766
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,500
9,500.

1767
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,500
6,900.

1768
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,500
6,300.

1769
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,500
4,400.

1770
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,500
5,500.

1771
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,500
16, 8,500.

1772
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,500
6,500.

1773
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,500
10,400.

1774
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,500
Yeah, 4,500.

1775
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,500
Great.

1776
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Which one has separate driver?

1777
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,500
5,500.

1778
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,500
5,500.

1779
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,500
8,400.

1780
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,500
3,500.

1781
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,500
2,500.

1782
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,500
I'm not going to pass a speed-pain word in 2000 and I'm going to do that.

1783
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,500
And then, as if you're thinking about the base, if you would be thinking about it.

1784
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,500
Sure, you're going to find all the code.

1785
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,500
But it's 27-way.

1786
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,500
I apologize.

1787
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,500
Three runways.

1788
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,500
The larger the graph.

1789
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,500
Land on two, neither.

1790
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Which is 10,000.

1791
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
Well, if I'm not proud to take it.

1792
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
We're going to land on one with a speed-pain word.

1793
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
We'll just go up to 1-6-2-1.

1794
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,500
I'm going to find for a big approach.

1795
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,500
We're over in I-O-N-U.

1796
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,500
And 30-Quit.

1797
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,500
The important flight following through to the public service.

1798
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,500
And through to that.

1799
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,500
5-2-5-1.

1800
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,500
We're 5-4-6-8-2-3.

1801
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,500
He's 28-2-1-2.

1802
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,500
This is my valve.

1803
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,500
I look like he's on a moody ahead.

1804
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,500
And speed-deprivedly meant.

1805
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,500
Now, it's all about this 4-mile.

1806
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,500
And I go to the tower.

1807
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,500
1-8-3.

1808
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,500
6-5-4-5-2.

1809
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,500
1-5-5-1.

1810
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,500
It makes training every 18-7-rient lobster.

1811
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-9-8-8-8-8.

1812
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:48,000
Alright so we're 20,000 feet here. We're coming up on here with shortly. We slowed to about

1813
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,520
145 knots. There's a boon ahead of us. We can't see him.

1814
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,520
That's those five small miles out of us.

1815
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:06,520
Not a bad day. Easy. We can see the boat bridge from here because it's a boat and it's a boat.

1816
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,520
Yeah. All those bridges were the light.

1817
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,520
That's the, uh, that's a small pond.

1818
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,520
Tower and plenty to go with the light.

1819
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,520
That's the light ahead of us.

1820
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,520
We're just going to do another eight of four of them tower. We're going to light two to

1821
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:24,520
the right player to land traffic in the fatter on the left traffic.

1822
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,520
We're about to cross the Fable approach close into the hand where you're important.

1823
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,520
Which is why they need to keep us in 2,000 feet so that people can win in the rune of us.

1824
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,520
I think you're aware of this, uh, rune between you.

1825
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,520
There's a traffic pattern to about 1,000 feet for this circuit.

1826
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,520
It's up to six green under an under a zero arm.

1827
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,520
A tower, one zero three five three again.

1828
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:50,520
I believe the large, but with hope that it's actually on length of out the middle of the day.

1829
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,520
There are 98 traffic in the other way, sir.

1830
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:58,520
It's a nice airport for small planes because...

1831
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,520
The larger planes of the small planes don't have to use the same word with them.

1832
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,520
There's five one, where to keep your plane.

1833
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,520
There's six here for every one.

1834
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,520
We're going to light two to the right at all times. We're going to light three, three, both to land.

1835
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,520
We're going to light two to the right.

1836
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,520
Well, this is not what it's gonna do.

1837
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,520
It's gonna take five and four weeks before the airport starts, right?

1838
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,520
Right, we're going to take off.

1839
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,520
We're going to take five and four with the open car,

1840
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,520
hold towards the landing track.

1841
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,520
Well, we have something inside.

1842
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,520
It's gonna take five and four weeks.

1843
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,520
The view's being generally related.

1844
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,520
Is that a left-air for the option?

1845
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,520
So, two to the left for the rear, sir.

1846
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,520
2800 Lps traffic ahead on the right for the right of Moody and 1,000 feet.

1847
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,520
You're in number two, following in Hayden's top rear.

1848
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,520
And left traffic for the left to be in the number two.

1849
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,520
We're going to have to be not open.

1850
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,520
So, this is our last facility.

1851
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,520
We were talking to Sidder, which handled the high altitude.

1852
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,520
Then we talked to approach, which handles low altitude in the vicinity of an airport.

1853
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,520
And now we're talking to the control tower,

1854
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:02,520
with which handles just literally traffic immediately in the area of that airport.

1855
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,520
And then once we touch down, we get off the runway,

1856
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,520
and then we wait until it's over to ground control.

1857
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,520
And then we're up there to change the runway.

1858
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,520
Our last frequency, we'll handle number two to the following one.

1859
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,520
For the right, E9 Delta.

1860
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,520
And then the fifth frequency on the runway,

1861
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,520
we're going to ground up 0.00.

1862
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,520
Oh, the ground.

1863
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,520
Right, over to the side.

1864
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,520
And almost ready to start now.

1865
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,520
We're still level of 2,000.

1866
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,520
We're going to 135,000.

1867
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:41,520
Sometimes in a situation like this,

1868
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,520
you'll be asked to keep your speed up,

1869
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
or keep your speed down.

1870
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,520
You'll accommodate the flow.

1871
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,520
We don't know anybody who's here,

1872
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
except for the boonier head of us,

1873
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,520
who should be just above and below.

1874
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,520
75,000 runway, two seven right,

1875
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,520
cleared land, wind, two seven, zero at it.

1876
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,520
So the wind is straight down the runway.

1877
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,520
I have no excuse for anything less than the perfect landing.

1878
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,520
I just disengage the autopilot.

1879
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,520
Watch this, like back before.

1880
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,520
No, no, no, no.

1881
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,520
I think there comes a landing gear.

1882
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,520
There's no one to contact the OPs on the 50.

1883
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,520
The landing gear is down in lock three green lights.

1884
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,520
Bring back the throttle.

1885
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,520
And noise you hear slightly is the auto-bucker.

1886
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
We're getting seven left.

1887
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,520
We're getting seven right, we're getting seven left.

1888
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,520
There's one.

1889
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
The instrument approach is seven left.

1890
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,520
We're getting one of our boats.

1891
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,520
We've got six high level, we...

1892
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,520
We always need to know the landfront.

1893
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,520
Seven right, please.

1894
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,520
One just done a ride, 20 left.

1895
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,520
We've been slow to 120.

1896
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,520
Now I put up a boat flaps.

1897
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,520
Which is 15 degrees of flaps at this point.

1898
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,520
Wouldn't you clear there's a boat flaps?

1899
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,520
A boat flaps?

1900
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,520
About 110 knots.

1901
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,520
We're gonna use your on that onion upon turn right and end up going up.

1902
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,520
Two to three miles on the airport.

1903
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:11,520
It's a beautiful day, great view of San Francisco.

1904
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,520
I can all see the condo.

1905
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,520
There's an adept with how much he got.

1906
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,520
He's waiting for you.

1907
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,520
Now he's got a red bomb.

1908
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,520
He's got a red bomb.

1909
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,520
It's nice and warm.

1910
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,520
What a feel.

1911
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,520
He got a red bomb.

1912
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,520
You can get the bill that's above the ghetto.

1913
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,520
Yeah sure.

1914
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,520
The pre-wain north westbound runway 275.

1915
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,520
I will always land up in the runway.

1916
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,520
27-year-old runway 11.

1917
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,520
Again.

1918
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,520
Got a gas.

1919
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,520
I can't wait to follow the runway.

1920
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,520
Undercarriage.

1921
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,520
It's just here.

1922
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,520
The prop.

1923
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,520
Flatters.

1924
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,520
Right, we're now aligned with the runway 29 right.

1925
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,520
27.

1926
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,520
The flag's at 27 right.

1927
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,520
Watch this.

1928
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,520
It's at 35-399-010.

1929
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,520
The rabbit lights off the ILSC down there.

1930
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,520
It's a little tracing strobe there.

1931
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,520
I think.

1932
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,520
Not that you could use them on a day like this.

1933
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,520
It's so beautiful.

1934
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,520
He entered up the way in parking.

1935
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,520
Either way, or he might go.

1936
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,520
No, no, no, no, no.

1937
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,520
We're going back to 100 knots at this point.

1938
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,520
Go.

1939
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,520
I'll look up here and enter another row.

1940
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
I'll look up here and enter another row.

1941
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,520
I'll look up here and enter another row.

1942
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,520
I'll look up here and enter another row.

1943
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,520
That would be nice.

1944
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,520
It makes real, unless noisy landing.

1945
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,520
I'll look up here and enter another row.

1946
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,520
No, that's easier.

1947
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,520
So I don't even know what our slope is like.

1948
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,520
If there's a little slope in the runway 29.

1949
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,520
First I couldn't balance your ILSC on that.

1950
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,520
You don't know.

1951
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,520
Yeah, there is an ILSC in the light.

1952
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,520
Because he is a glide slope.

1953
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,520
Just a help-up.

1954
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,520
We don't need to.

1955
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,520
Three, eight, Charlie.

1956
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,520
Run light, two, seven, left, third for the ILSC.

1957
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,520
Good, yeah.

1958
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,520
We've got the left, three, two, one.

1959
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,520
I'll speed it slow.

1960
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,520
You're going to speed only 70-3 knots.

1961
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
There's to be 100.

1962
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,520
So there's a good headwind.

1963
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,520
More than a 25-0.

1964
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,520
We have to come again.

1965
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,520
That's the middle parker.

1966
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,520
Get up here.

1967
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,520
Here's where the folks disappear.

1968
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,520
There's a speed of decision.

1969
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,520
There's a speed of decision.

1970
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,520
There's a speed of the player.

1971
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,520
Which you could not go around.

1972
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,520
You're gonna go around.

1973
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,520
We're not saying that.

1974
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,520
We can fly that far.

1975
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,520
We can.

1976
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,520
It's strong.

1977
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,520
Strong headwinds here.

1978
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,520
The whole power.

1979
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,520
And we've made the runway.

1980
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,520
We've got a four-flop.

1981
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,520
We can.

1982
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,520
There we are.

1983
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,520
All right.

1984
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,520
That's a neat thing.

1985
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,520
You should get down.

1986
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,520
With a little slip here.

1987
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,520
A little bit get straight.

1988
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,520
A little sideways.

1989
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,520
He's right maneuver.

1990
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,520
Line our solar wave.

1991
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,520
There we go.

1992
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,520
All the ground.

1993
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,520
Those little slideways flight maneuver.

1994
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,520
Line our solar wave.

1995
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,520
On or whatever.

1996
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,520
On our zero, contact open.

1997
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,520
Fowl tower.

1998
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,520
On 1, 2, 7, 20.

1999
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,520
And see how well we can do it.

2000
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,520
Just set this poppy down.

2001
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,520
There we go.

2002
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,520
We're all the ground.

2003
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,520
Those little pl, little.

2004
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,520
Good landing.

2005
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,520
Didn't want to get off to the right.

2006
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,520
Wasn't Went to So Strong.

2007
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,520
We're almost stopped.

2008
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,520
Didn't spill and drop.

2009
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,520
didn't spill drop.

2010
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,520
And then five hours, but turn right, contact ground, point out again.

2011
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,520
It's a five off.

2012
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,520
All right, that was fantastic.

2013
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,520
Fuck it round and get permission to go.

2014
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,520
Kaiser's right there in front of us could get lost, could we?

2015
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,840
Hey, ground, but he has a one big step five off, but it's a lot of peace out of

2016
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,840
white because of me.

2017
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,840
It's a one out of five ground, so I can see the cut.

2018
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,840
It's a one off.

2019
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,480
All right, I'm shutting this down.

2020
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,480
I was great Doug.

2021
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,480
Thanks for the...

2022
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,540
Rossic Brokeco, thanks for the sleeping general.

2023
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,560
Louder key to the Upper Reich.

2024
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,560
And point out the last round.

2025
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:21,980
You're right here.

2026
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,480
I can smell the dry water.

2027
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,480
先 out.

2028
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,480
Show DAY 1.

2029
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,480
Three of them on Friday.

2030
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,480
Two two says.

2031
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,480
Come over with you rot!

2032
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,480
Go and cross.

2033
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,480
You go through on Saturday.

2034
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,460
I have my tent.

2035
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,460
Ah, no.

2036
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,480
That's...

2037
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,460
me.

2038
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,460
Squadron, didn't need to finish.

2039
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,460
Between you and that one.

2040
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,460
Like a bigger day.

2041
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,460
There are still about ten days left.

2042
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,460
If all that work out we can rearrange moment times.

2043
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,460
So the rest of the rest of the most part of the stuff is moving trees.

2044
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,460
Okay, so long.
