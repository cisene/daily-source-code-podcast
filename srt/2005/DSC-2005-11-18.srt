1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta's share a Charlie to eight.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Two.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
One, two, three.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,000
One, two, three.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A $16 million worth of air in playing strap to my ass.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Fantastic. It's Adam Curry.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, man. Just free wheeling a little bit, you know?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hey, I'm back at the cottage everybody. It's Friday.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Didn't want to miss the opportunity to celebrate that with you.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So source code, come and act here.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And let's get into the spirit, Charlie.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One, two, three.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Just give me the second chance for Christmas.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No living alone. I can't see you crying.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The standing beneath the mistletoe.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't face a glow. I don't fire your side.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I feel I've been lost in the wind and snow.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I watch your beauty and its haunted.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It must be looking right through me.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want us to forgive this.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Just give me the second chance for Christmas.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I will wait for you under these stars until I see the sun.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You're the only one, the only one.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I love you.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Just give me the light on your Christmas tree.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I am acting cold on your stereo.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That she is back where it's out of the breeze.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The top is without an angel.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I never lied and conveyed it.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I saw the forest for planning.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I want us to forgive this.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Just give me the second chance for Christmas.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I will just give you the second chance for Christmas.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, candy butchers.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's excellent.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Give me a second chance for Christmas.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Just showed up on the pod save music network along with what to do about Michael.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They have joined.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Welcome, guys.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hello, everybody. This is the daily source code.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There's no business doing a podcast after having travel.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Transatlantic from San Francisco to London.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There's too much fun.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's Friday.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What a weather change.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I left it in the 70s.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Beautiful sunshine, very clear skies.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't see a lot of missed this past week that I was on the west coast.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The frost is on the ground.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It was almost.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was just a little bit of a freezing when we landed.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't know.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It just kind of motivated me.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You'll hear me slurin' over my words and tripping it over the place.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I did sleep on the plane.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Once again, another great virgin flight.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm paying it through the noseboard and loving it at the same time.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's an amazing product.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Was it really that simple to make flying that much more enjoyable?

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Whatever he did, I think it's really the excellent configuration of the airplane.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you hear this microphone?

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't think I have the high all now.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The one that I want.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think I have to do some configuration to make it work properly in the cottage set up here.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I know one thing.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It doesn't fit in the stand.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I have a jam through a hole in the top of the podcast complex.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It really does sound like crap.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Maybe I should switch to the other microphone.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think that's probably going to be better until I figure out how to configure this one.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So Thursday, just to keep you up the speed on what's been going on, what we've been thinking about.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I was getting picked up to go to the airport at a quarter to two.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It was, hello.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hello.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hey, babe.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come on in.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I heard a sort of a different sound.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
A different sound?

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Just like you are in.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, that's why it seemed better.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So that's why I came in, I thought something's wrong.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Wait a minute.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, no, there you go.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, okay.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I was just saying, I was saying, wow, this microphone sounds like shit.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you stoned?

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Are you out of it?

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I mean, you are tired.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, but I wanted to show.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's Friday.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We have to celebrate.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's good to see you.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Tell the listeners.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Put your headphones.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I was asked, no, because I'm going, I have things to do.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Like reading the paper.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Excuse me.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Excuse me.

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The deal is reading the paper.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Um, you know.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Did I know what?

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, um, no.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Have you?

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Have you?

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Tell the listeners.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But what?

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I was asked for the, for the Wizard of Oz.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
By Yoke from the end of production?

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No, I, I know.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I just started the show.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So, uh, but I wrote it down.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I remember to talk about, well, why don't, now that you're here.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a privilege.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I have to say.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now that you're here, why don't you tell us about it.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, that's it.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, well, no, wait a minute.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Now, say, so you were asked by, uh,

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yoke from the end of production.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This guy's huge and theater.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He does all the musicals in, like in New York.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, so when Mama me, you know, he gets the license for that.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And he produces that.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And then I'm sure, you know, he'll do every single way.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You know what, Ron said, I'll get to that in a second.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So they asked you for what?

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
For one of the, uh, major roles in, in the, in the Wizard of Oz music.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In the Wizard of Oz music.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In the Wizard of Oz.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And I said no.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Well, first you said no.

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, I'm all the way.

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Because this is probably in Holland, of course.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It was in Holland.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Would you do it?

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Would you do it?

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm maybe because Christina's in school the whole day.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If it did.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's seven days.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And so what I would have said, maybe,

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you know, let me do it for a month or you know,

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
cos that, like they do here.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sometimes Americans come over and they are in the theater in London.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They do that for a month and go back.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And then they can say, I was always on the.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I was a website.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I was a sister.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I was a sister.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Exactly.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
See then you're real.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Imagine enriching and enriching and enriching.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Right.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So I thought, you know, but let me ask you a question.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What have been a nice experience?

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,680
nice experience and take no offense, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't for Dorothy. So what

165
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:30,600
are the other roles? No there's also good one. Is that Galinda? So it doesn't

166
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:37,560
matter it would have been a wonderful experience and we sure. Yeah but you know I'm

167
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:46,320
all the way here. I'll let them jump out. So you didn't have the headphones on so you

168
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:56,120
didn't hear me. Okay. But I'm here. I'm here for you. And for me. And for my daughter. And that's it.

169
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,400
So it doesn't matter. You look great babe. Well thank you so much. You know when you're not there

170
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,640
you know always sleep like a log. You're fine with the eye can sleep. So Patricia's saying well

171
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,160
you know I've seen it. I think because of the energy that you produce at night that I have

172
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,960
restless nights. So it's really not good that you're sleeping next to me was basically what you're

173
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:25,720
saying there. Well of course I love it you know but the moment we fall asleep and you you are very

174
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,640
I mean heavy, heavy, deep sleeper and I'm all very jealous of it. Oh yeah I'm out like I'll

175
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,200
and I go to sleep in three seconds. Yes I'm a light sleeper because I'm a mommy and I want to hear

176
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,320
everything and I want to hear everybody breathe and I think so yeah and what I said to you was

177
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:54,200
I have an idea that my bed sleeping thing comes from your sleeping thing because I'm always

178
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,240
awake or awake a couple of times. I wake up a couple of times. I think it's because you have

179
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,400
so much energy in your body. There's so much going on in your brains and your brain just keep on going

180
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,600
even if you're asleep I know that. I'll be you have sweat attacks and you have I don't know

181
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:18,200
what your attack is but I have an idea and maybe somebody who's listening knows all about it

182
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,960
yeah. I feel your energy and it wakes me up. That's what I think. What do you do?

183
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,800
But how come it? Well that's possible. I believe that. I buy it but how come it doesn't wake me out

184
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,200
because I'm just sitting there generating all this energy. Because you're dead tired. No you're

185
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,400
good sleeper. I mean I don't know you're you're deeper than that. But my brain should be resting at night.

186
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,720
It shouldn't be crunching. Yeah you're I think your body is resting but you brains you know I think

187
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,640
they never sleep. They just go over the whole thing in a whole day. Now for you that's a lot.

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,440
A lot of things happening in a whole day. Yeah. So yeah. My theory. My brain is at least a doing

189
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,320
something. Yeah. Yeah that might as well be. I'm very happy your brains are doing a lot.

190
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:12,360
So Patricia who by the way flies in my airplane more than I do is paying a surprise visit to her dad

191
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:20,440
tomorrow with Christina. Oh, hold on. Did I just lose you? No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah it's going to be

192
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:31,160
big surprise. He wasn't feeling very well. He was 80. He's 80 now and his birthday was last week this week

193
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:39,400
getting off the week. I mean. And so 80 is quite a lot especially for somebody who has four

194
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:47,880
bypasses. So he wasn't feeling very well. And so I thought you know I'll uh I just surprise him and

195
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,320
make him happy. You know. Oh yeah. Well don't surprise him too much. Man's had five passes.

196
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,880
Don't come in. Don't make a mishaw. Yeah. I'm going to go out for dinner but he doesn't know we're going

197
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,520
to be there. Christina and I know but make sure he doesn't he doesn't freak out when he sees you. No

198
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:11,000
he will. No. I'm not that far away but it's still you know it's good it'll be quite a surprise.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,920
I'm not coming from Australia. Australia oh I have some stuff from Australia. Yeah I heard that.

200
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,160
Okay. Look if you can understand here then you have to put the hand. No no I'm going now.

201
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:29,080
And uh oh. What do you do myself on paper here? Okay baby. Okay honey. Thank you. Okay.

202
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:38,280
I love you. Bye. Okay so you've got a little update there. What I was going to say before

203
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:47,720
Patricia came in is that Thursday was all a pod safe music network day and you know getting

204
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,160
development team together because you know well we basically as I said in the last source code

205
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,760
to get the pod safe music network really rolling we got to have you know some dedicated development

206
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,480
on that and which means we we're hiring for that. I think you'll see that show up on

207
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,400
podshow.com. There's a job link. I think there's a job link. Please tell me that's a job link.

208
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,960
That's got to be let me just say maybe even be up there right now. Hold on and you

209
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,120
couldn't get all this information from the show notes as well. And by the way I want to thank

210
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:28,520
the everyone who's doing the show notes on on the wiki. It's so wonderful. It makes my life

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,040
so much easier and I think you I'm because I always check the show notes out and I see

212
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,800
there are also people put comments up there. It's it's really good. It's detailed and you know

213
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,160
sometimes there's little mistakes in there but then the great thing is I can go in and I can

214
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,160
correct it. Let me just see a news about us come on it's got to be something here employment

215
00:13:49,160 --> 00:14:00,680
opportunities. Okay. Wow let me see if web design and developer. Okay. Yeah this is like five or six

216
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:13,560
openings there. Alrighty. Oh we have a this is this is very cool. So it's starting. Advertisers are

217
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:20,520
starting to support podcasting. We have a new sponsor on the pod show podcast network. It's

218
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,960
and I was really happy when I heard that they were coming on board because like you know this is

219
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:33,800
definitely a sponsor I want to talk about in my show. It's EarthLink Internet and if you're I got

220
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,400
to tell you I'm I'm the old guy on the block and I've been you know old school internet I learned

221
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:48,120
about the internet I had a dial-up connection to what was it panics internet in New York City and

222
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,040
basically you you would you would tell that in and later of course SSH but first you tell that in

223
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,360
and then you have to start a slip connection you know by typing a command to get that going on

224
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,520
on and a unix prompt and then you could start up your TCP stack and then you could you know run

225
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,720
a couple of applications and the one that was really used the most even when I was starting off with

226
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,440
this command line based go for protocol you know this is from the days when I was around and I saw a lot

227
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,760
of ISPs internet service providers spring up in those days and there were some you know some real

228
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,000
core companies that were you know that were really based on the engineering and the roots of the

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,480
internet and I've always considered EarthLink to be one of them and prior to their sponsorship

230
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,040
I've always held an EarthLink account I've used them for webmail and I always had a dial-up account

231
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,040
with EarthLink you always had that my back pocket if there's some situation where I just get stuck

232
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:55,160
you know without any wireless it doesn't happen that much anymore but so the you know they're

233
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,600
reliable you know they've always had that that old school internet type of reliability and

234
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,080
air about them and what they have of course is new school services and as a sponsor you'll be

235
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:16,680
hearing on the number of pod shows about their phone service they've also have a wireless email

236
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:24,120
and I just couldn't be happier that I'm able to select cool sponsors for this show that makes it

237
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,560
a hell of a lot easier all right let's get to some Gmail here because I also want to listen to some music

238
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:38,360
oh yeah um Todd was his Todd Lizer I think it is L-E-I-S-E-R he said up a a frapper map for the daily source

239
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:46,120
code I've pointed to it from curie.com and we'll definitely have it in the show notes for today

240
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,600
what it is it's if you haven't seen this frappers it's a I really like it it a lot it's kind of a

241
00:16:52,680 --> 00:17:00,200
mashup of google maps and and flicker photos and you couldn't put a little pinpoint on the

242
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,080
google map where you're listening to the show from and you can add a picture in there and you know

243
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,440
some kind of caption the link if you want and so it's at frapper that's like the flicker

244
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:19,080
spelling F-R-A-P-P-R dot com slash D-S-C listeners so we'll have that in the show notes let me see

245
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:26,360
there was some audio coming up here oh this was a great one this is from Doug Dyson I read this on my

246
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,760
blackberry when I landed at Heathrow and I actually started to reply to him I thought no no no come on man

247
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:39,240
let me stupid I can reply to it no you read this to you hey Adam thanks for skipping over my

248
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,560
L-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R radio promo that I worked so hard on the other day so you could

249
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,320
instead play some other totally random feedback clips from your Gmail inbox it must really take

250
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,360
more than passion to podcast as seems podcasting is already at the who you know click stage

251
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,000
you know I gotta tell you that I had increasingly more email is coming that it sounds like this

252
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,480
saying oh you know the mainstream media is taking over it's all ruined and at every single phase of

253
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,600
growth in podcasting I've heard these voices and sometimes are the same but I think they're actually

254
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,200
they're probably in this case even some new ones because it is growing and it's growing rapidly

255
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:31,560
and people get very protective of something they love and you know if you send me a promo on

256
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,240
let's see when was it the 14th you're pitching and moaning about me and calling me

257
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:48,600
part of a who you know click you know like five not only three days later I mean come on

258
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,840
man I mean this there's no rhyme or reason to all this I just pick whatever I can get and I play

259
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,480
whatever promo comes my way and since you've pitched a moan about it

260
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,760

272
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:47,480
okay uh oh man I've been trying to actually manage some of these uh oh what's this do I have a

273
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:54,040
call coming through or I'm sorry excuse me let me just see what this is is this uh pdobe's oh

274
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:03,800
amen an interview oh man okay well the interview will just have to wait we're talking right now

275
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:11,560
I've been trying to manage my Gmail and actually tagging stuff with a DSC label and then going through

276
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,160
that and then moving something to a today or yeah today label which means for today's show

277
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,400
and you know the only thing I can't do is and it would be wonderful I could if I could rearrange

278
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,680
the order um because I would let me control the flow of the show a little bit better but I at

279
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,960
least I've qualified what we should talk about today and I'm not just hitting it at random hey

280
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,000
Adam says a rolf after having heard it on your show oh yeah this is a lots of emails about this I was

281
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,160
so on these enthusiastic to buy the what to do with Michael song by candy boochers and iTunes guess

282
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,720
what it's not available here in Switzerland interestingly enough the iTunes error message I got

283
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,320
is not you can't buy this song in your country but just your search was not successful the buy on

284
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,240
iTunes link on candy boochers website provides the same result man this kind of stuff pisses me off

285
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,080
when I see the digital divide is right around the corner now I'm ready to buy music legally

286
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,960
and the facility seem to be there too but I'm prevented by of doing so all the best rolf so I've

287
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,840
received a lot of those types of emails uh particularly from uh see uh I think New Zealand Australia

288
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:18,760
and uh other uh basically anything outside of um outside of the United States because I'll

289
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,880
have all these different music stores and I guess you have to clear every song through every music store

290
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,760
and as you know I've been thinking a lot about this uh about this stuff and we had some pretty deep

291
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,680
conversations yesterday as we were uh briefing team on um what were you know the direction we're

292
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,520
taking the positive music networks so of course we're you know we've talked about the commerce

293
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:49,640
transaction I'll get to that in a second or the the commerce piece and then there's also the um um

294
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,680
the unlabel so those two pieces are gonna have to start to fit together and I think we have a

295
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,200
pretty clear vision we already you know we're going in pretty much the direction we were we were at

296
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:08,840
right now um but as you start to think about selling I don't know if I can if I can go go this

297
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,880
deep on this stuff because my head's real fuzzy if you think about selling an MP3 versus uh any

298
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,840
other file format that has copy protection in it forget it digital rights restriction some call

299
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,280
a digital rights management you know we all know we're talking about i've heard other you know

300
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:35,000
some uh who was that i think it was uh okay maybe it was on twit that i heard him talking about

301
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:43,800
the MP3 if it's a DRM that the value essentially is uh is zero um you know once you you've sold

302
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:50,280
that you you make one transaction but it can't go anywhere I mean I know I'm not making any sense

303
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,760
right now but if you think about it what is the difference between an MP3 with with a song or an

304
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:03,320
MP3 with a podcast now they're both MP3's which means they'll both play on you know on any kind of

305
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,880
player uh almost any player today does MP3 if not you you basically can't even be in business it's

306
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:18,280
barrier to entry they both contain data um they may be of roughly the same size although one

307
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:24,440
seems to be a lot larger uh that would be the podcast because it's longer and so it's a larger file

308
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:32,600
but it's still one's in zero's it's still sound um except um the format of what you hear

309
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,720
of the audio signal is usually a song well we all know what a song is and we all recognize what

310
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,120
a podcast is but what's interesting about it is there's all this talk about copy protection

311
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,400
and all that they're not just talk there's all this copy protection on music

312
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,920
yet here we are just freely distributing our podcasts on MP3's

313
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,720
and look at what's happened to the growth of podcasting because these MP3's work everywhere and

314
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,320
I don't even think it's about money but maybe that that's it it's two different ways of monetizing

315
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,200
audio one way for that particular format is through the purchase model which is almost like a

316
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:26,120
donation only it's a pre-defined donation and then the other is um based on no revenue model

317
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:36,200
or based on other ones such as sponsorship and advertising uh

318
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,240
what what I find fascinating is and I was reading you know I'm uh what was I think time magazine

319
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:51,480
on the plane um where time and time again you you indeed read you know to thwart pirates

320
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,120
that's basically the type of language that is used when when talking about DRM and and why it's

321
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:04,280
implemented we've never actually had a chance to try it to try and see if it would work with just MP3's

322
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,760
free and clear and if what people would just pay for it I mean if you want to steal it if you can

323
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,280
steal it anyway it doesn't matter if it's if it's uh DRM you know anything that I can play

324
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,560
off of my computer I can record you know so I can easily make a make a copy if I'm willing to go through

325
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:26,360
all that but it's not even an issue of ease it's uh you know like there's some wide scale

326
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,680
operation where people are you know baking up millions of MP3's you know that so that it has to be

327
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:39,560
automated you know so it just makes no sense really um it's really because there's a guy in the middle

328
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:49,240
a guy in the middle who is seeing that the artists can go directly to their customers and they

329
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,560
can have a direct financial transaction and that's the piece that needs to be enabled and I think

330
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,840
that relationship is actually going to be pretty healthy particularly when you see how enthusiastic

331
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,320
people are getting in on the ground floor with an artist and kind of growing up with them

332
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:14,120
it's the same type of relationship that I saw with some podcasters I think and she sent me three

333
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,320
emails and I think it was Marilyn her name is Marilyn pretty sure who sponsored Mark from the

334
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,360
tartan podcast co-sponsored his his trip to the podcast expo you know it's that kind of relationship

335
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,080
and it's about it's not more than just the music it's about going to the shows and it's about

336
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,760
you know some form of interaction and buying the t-shirts and you know and promoting your your art

337
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,280
and that's that's the piece and you know so in the middle there's not a lot is needed I think that

338
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,560
the one you know how many had these great conversations you know what what what is making this happen

339
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,920
what is becoming really fun is podcasting is the discovery mechanism this is the thing that

340
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Silicon Valley still hasn't figured out they're still talking about and I'm sure there's there is a place for

341
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:09,160
for matching up you know for recommendation engines of course for comparison engines you know

342
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,280
if you like that podcast you like this one but really when people are just talking on their podcast

343
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,320
and playing music and and we're listening to other podcasts and you know that's how we discover

344
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,080
and it doesn't have to be a text based you know search discovery type mechanism it can be just

345
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:31,640
part of listening and you know don't expect it to grow like wildfire immediately let it flow let it come

346
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:42,920
and and that's the you know that that's kind of the what is the word the ecosystem that I see

347
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,960
that is that is emerging and all the different services there I want to send out a you know a CD

348
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:56,200
to someone who purchases that with you know with nice liner notes and you know maybe something else

349
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,520
package with that that's what CD baby does and you know all these pieces are there who needs the

350
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:08,040
record company it really isn't necessary there's just no added value particularly if you look at the

351
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:16,040
if you look at the financial side of it you'll get such a minor piece from from the old system

352
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,360
and you'll have such a majority piece of each transaction literally

353
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,320
of this new system that's emerging that it will be really it will be worth it you'll make more

354
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,200
money with less hassle and you'll have more fun it's that simple and anyone can join in you know

355
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:39,640
anyone who wants it hello hey baby

407
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:06,360
of customized news so far um I still seem to have either read everything or was not interested in

408
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,080
the you know the pieces that were available that come through basically you know several hours

409
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,560
after after it's put together which of course is many hours after the news is created but there

410
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:23,480
are some like longer features let me see I got a great this is also very cool huh who sent

411
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:32,920
no oh man I got a forward from match for something that oh yeah here it is this is Brian no

412
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:41,720
Brian no um I first discovered him through well I can't remember if it was through the my Maryland

413
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,760
podcast or for was the other no I think I discovered him first I don't remember how but he has the

414
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,880
the Frank truth podcast which is all about the life and time of Francis Albert Sonatra

415
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:02,600
oh man and of course with the with my going purely pod safe he you know he really freaked out

416
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:10,840
because and I tell you with with with due cause because the Sonatra estate does not mess around when it

417
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:17,560
comes to their copyrights and you know so Brian of course is you know it's you know it was podcast

418
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,360
about his passions so imagine how horrible it is not to be able well you can still talk about it but

419
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:28,280
without the music you know you just it's that's almost impossible so I can only imagine if I

420
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,520
couldn't talk about the stuff that I like to talk about on my podcast that would be that's just horrible

421
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:40,520
like horrible thought so he's now converting that energy into into some other stuff and this thing is

422
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:48,200
the he's Matt he so he he felt also you know he loved mashups and he knows that I stopped my mashups

423
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,240
playing mashups you know he's trying to look for some kind of format and he came up with is what he

424
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,560
calls the the world news mashup this is the one from see from yesterday I think but you got to listen

I was like whoa when I heard that it just blew me away for a second you know what he actually

444
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:44,520
sent me a demo of I guess it must have been the first episode that he was doing and I listened

445
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,920
to it and for some reason I didn't parse it you know and now I'm realizing what happened it's

446
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,480
because when you hear news like that that's how it goes by you know you never really kind of

447
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,840
whatever you know sounds right sounds really urgent sounds important and now that I'm hearing

448
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,440
that he's just literally mashing up news headlines like oh wait a minute now and I like it I really do

449
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:05,800

00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:51,000
Ask Capra BMI so yeah once you write something the minute you lift your pen from the paper that's

458

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,600
that the CC played in action and it's good that's Bob Bichler from the ordinary average guy podcast

We're just doing it, we're having a day

492
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,800
Well, I haven't done it

493
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,800
It's always the same, I haven't done it

494
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,800
We're having a day

495
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,800

I've had enough

500
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
I've had enough

501
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
I've had enough

502
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
I've had enough

503
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Sean

504
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
I mess it up again

505
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,800
Let me get it here

506
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh

507
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,800
The ID3 tags weren't, oh, messed up

508
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Sean Moore below, okay

509
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
P.S. as the ordinary average guy

510
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
No, I don't work for Sean, I just dig his tunes

511
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Yeah, I hear you totally

512
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Well, we've had a different Friday type of show today

513
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,800
I realize actually that you have two different homes

514
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,800
that you're living in, you are expecting things to sound

515
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
Like they sounded for the past week

516
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
or you were and then things sound different

517
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
And I'm realizing that the, you know,

518
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,800
have these Apple, Harmon, Carden, whatever

519
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Craydon, speakers with the subwoofer

520
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
It's really nice, but it's not like

521
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
The acoustics that I'm used to

522
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
Of the MM50 that that's what I have

523
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,800
The iMac in the, in the condo hooked up to

524
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,800
And that has, it has, I don't know

525
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
Is it like I almost want more direct sound

526
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
And of course, I can slip the iPod into it

527
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,800
It's just, it's a minebender

528
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,800
So, daily source code.com is where you can subscribe

529
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,800

00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,800
It's all over the place

532
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
And he feedback us into to me, Adam at curry.com

533
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,800
You know, my Gmail, by the way, after I got that

534
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,800
Super geeky extra, extra action space

535
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,800
They gave me four gigs

536
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Instead of the usual two as a special

537
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
Special geek feature

538
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
I'm already up to 85% of that

539
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,800
Three and a half gigs, it's outrageous

540
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,800
They can't grow fast enough

541
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
To provide me with the space I need

542
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,800
With the requirements I have, it's unbelievable

543
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
That's, anyway

544
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Promotes.podshow.com

545
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
If you have any promos, I promise what I'll do

546
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,800
And who knows, I might even do a show over the weekend

547
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Since I'm kind of in the vibe now

548
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,800
And tomorrow I'll have my thoughts all straightened out

549
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
And maybe I can explain a little bit more

550
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,800
What I was attempting to talk about today

551
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,800
So I do appreciate you listening to my ramblings

552
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,800
Well, so we have to talk about it

553
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
I think that's it

554
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,800
Let me just get some one more piece of pod

555
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Say can use the take us out just into the weekend

556
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Let me just grab one of my favorites

557
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,800
So I play this for my tunes and I have to make a

558
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Was it like a magic playlist where they call that a smart playlist

559
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
That says no podcast otherwise

560
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,800
The podcasts, even though they're label podcasts

561
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,800
And they're in a special podcast category

562
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,800
They'll show up and they'll play in a shuffle

563
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,800
Which is not what I want from music

564
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
So let me see

565
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800

566
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
