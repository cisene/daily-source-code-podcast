00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Delta Sierra Charley 2...6...5...

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There are no secrets!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Only information you don't get higher!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Adam Curry!

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And it is Monday, October 24th in the year of our Lord 2005.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good morning everybody from Curry.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It is, once again, right in early, only a quarter to nine, 846 AM.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And to start of a new week.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And of course, it's one of those foggy, dreary, damp kind of cock-eyed days,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which will burn off around.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Great weekend. Lots of stuff to share with you.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now, if you subscribe to the podcast feed, then you probably already saw a little bit of what I was going to share with you on the Delta Sierra Charley Victor.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's the first video podcast.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We'll talk about that.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Got some nice pod save tunes lined up with, actually one that's, I think, pretty funny.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And some excellent feedback on topics that we talked about last week.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, yes. Are you ready for this week? I don't think I am.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Just kidding trying to accommodate myself here to get up and rolling because it's got a real busy day at the office.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to be there as early as possible.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think I told you this before that when I'm over in the UK at the cottage,

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
then I try to do all my meetings between 8 and 11 AM at Pacific Coast because that of course is,

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
for like 7 PM in the UK.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But when I'm here though, I've got to switch it around and I've got to delay everything until past 11.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Good old ADL from mashup town has been sending me cool mashups to listen to for,

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I usually sounds when every single day, even throughout the weekend.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I have a lot of choice, actually a big selection to choose from.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But this one really got me when I heard it for the first time.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Because it's song that is geared to my heart, at least one of the two,

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
well, actually both of the songs just mash up or geared to my heart.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The first one, which you could tell is blondies rap, sure, was a huge hit at the time.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I've gotten to a higher radio in Amsterdam and then of course,

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
while you're here mixed in with it, which I'll leave a surprise.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a song that I grew up with.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The dating source code is Monday to 24th.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Good morning, everybody.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right here on the stove, right here on the stove, right here on the stove,

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
get into this as a bar, and to this grill we're throwing.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Like a dog without a bone and a actor out of bone, right here on the stove.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There's a camera on the road.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's great to square my life as no one.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It gave a lot of money to me.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let your children play.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If you get to find a way to keep found a way.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're on the road.

You're on the road.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So we're running your hands out like you're a man

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Gotta love your man

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I see what you want to be

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Just have your body on

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
To eat doesn't matter

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm all fooled

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Your balls will be too big on

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Now it's all back to space

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Where you and I have a heart

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
With a huge face

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Saying you're hot

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're hot

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And you're gonna stop

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Just pass on

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Chuchai

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Cook man for more

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Start deep in body

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And now you're only eating dogs

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now it's sitting in the way

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And you're gonna be eating

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But a rock and roll country

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're gonna stop

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're gonna stop

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're gonna stop

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're gonna stop

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're gonna stop

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We're gonna stop

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000

00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We're gonna stop

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We're gonna stop

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We're gonna stop

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We're gonna stop

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We're gonna stop

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We're gonna stop

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We're gonna stop

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We're gonna stop

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We're gonna stop

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're gonna stop

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We're gonna stop

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We're gonna stop

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We're gonna stop

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're gonna stop

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We're gonna stop

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
When I first started at Radio

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Dessable in Amsterdam

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
In the Netherlands when I was

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm gonna say I was 16 years old

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That was the first pirate station

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I ever worked at

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This was a huge hit at the time

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It was just so...

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It was big

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It was underground still

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But it was just big

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And of course we were spinning

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And off of vinyl back in the day

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And this was funny

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
To actually meet Fab Five

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Fredie years later

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
At MTV

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When we see years 667

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Eight years later

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Even later than that

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
See

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
See, who, maybe even eight, yeah, nine years later,

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
I met him, Fab-Fab-Fab, Freddie,

209
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
when he started off at YoMTV Rapps.

210
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,400
And of course, the doors writers on the store

211
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,880
mashed up there.

212
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Wow, I had a weekend full of porn.

213
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,080
Yes, right.

214
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,600
A big guy, porn.

215
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,800
Ha ha ha ha.

216
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah, I'll let you participate.

217
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,200
Now, can you hear a smell this?

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
Yeah, I'm gonna open it up.

219
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
Can you guess what this is yet?

220
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,560
Doesn't sound too good.

221
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,440
Doesn't, okay.

222
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,040
Oh, man, it's like, I'm opening up a brand new,

223
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
or actually the contents of already been removed,

224
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
but opening up a power book box.

225
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
This is, oh, just smell that.

226
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,680
It's a combination of styrofoam and a card board

227
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,840
and plastic wrapping.

228
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,560
Oh, I had not won, not two.

229
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,120
Ha ha.

230
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,400
But three containers that I opened up this weekend.

231
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,400
That's right, Saturday, God up at a nice, leisurely noon.

232
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
I think I was a little tight.

233
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,560
You know, this jet lag,

234
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,520
even though you jump right into everything,

235
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,840
it does kind of catch up with you.

236
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,440
So, we can do nice to catch up on a couple hours of sleep

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,240
and so God up around noon.

238
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,840
Now, just easily got myself caffeinated,

239
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
then Patricia called,

240
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,560
those things that you call the phone,

241
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,360
or did she call on Skype?

242
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,040
I can't remember, but we chatted for a while.

243
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,840
Or she's on the phone, actually, for a while,

244
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,040
probably about hour and a half.

245
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,920
If there's one thing I really, really, really miss

246
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,440
about not being with my girls is the talk.

247
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,680
You know, yeah, I think I've gone through this before

248
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,680
that I wind up catching myself talking to myself

249
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,800
and Patricia misses it too, you know,

250
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
when Christine is off to school,

251
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
then there's basically no one home

252
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,360
and she starts talking to herself.

253
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,680
So maybe we should record those two conversations

254
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,840
and create a mashup of that.

255
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,880
Anyway, so after I was done off to the city,

256
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,080
I found, oh, I found all kinds of great things.

257
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,960
I was, of course, in a headed in a relative B-line

258
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,800
for the Apple store,

259
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040
but I had a couple of other things I want to do first.

260
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,400
I found out that only about four blocks from here.

261
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,280
Finally, I found the whole food supermarket

262
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,120
that I was looking for.

263
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,840
Everyone told me was in the neighborhood somewhere.

264
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,280
So I found that and it turns out

265
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,880
that actually market street in Union Square,

266
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
it's not all that far from the condo.

267
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,200
If you, you know, as long as it's not raining,

268
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,240
it's definitely a very doable walk

269
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,360
without groceries and stuff.

270
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,640
So I got, oh, man, I've been keeping a list.

271
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,800
You know, you really don't realize

272
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,680
how many things, what kind of stuff you've gotten

273
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,360
in your house that you use all the time

274
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,600
until you reach for it and you're like,

275
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,960
oh, I don't have that.

276
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,360
Like, I still don't have glasses,

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,320
but I do have light bulbs everywhere now

278
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,040
of the appropriate wattage, which is nice and low.

279
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,560
Anyway, between 25 and 40 watts,

280
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
preferably a pink or rose,

281
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
it works so well on the interior shots.

282
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,080
And then I had, you know, I did get a,

283
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,600
oh, yes, I had to get a track suit.

284
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,280
I'll tell you why in a second,

285
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm swimming trunks.

286
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
And then it was off to the Apple store.

287
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
So I done all the stuff that I really needed to get

288
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
and then I was ready to do some shopping.

289
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
And boy, did I?

290
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,320
In my possession now, I have a brand new G5 iMac.

291
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,000
That's the 17 incher.

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,560
The 20 incher was not in stock.

293
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,200
It is a 1.9 gigahertz machine.

294
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,640
It was crazy because I ordered, you know,

295
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,400
I wanted to get all the extra memory in there.

296
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,960
I want to put another gig and a half of memory in,

297
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,440
but they didn't have the extra memory,

298
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,880
it lay in around, which just kind of sucks.

299
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,200
I mean, so I said, you know, if I want,

300
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,880
I have to go back and have it put in there,

301
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,920
but I have the pro car or whatever I paid extra for.

302
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,800
So you don't have to wait when you hit

303
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,120
the genius bar.

304
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,480
Anyway, I got that.

305
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,440
And then I, Connor helped me out at the Apple store here

306
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
in San Francisco.

307
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,440
And we talked a lot about what kind of power book I should get.

308
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,600
And I decided on the 15 inch,

309
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,000
one point, it's like 1.67 gigahertz.

310
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,200
It has one gigabyte of RAM installed.

311
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,560
Again, there, I wanted to have an extra gig installed

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,760
again, same story, no RAM available for upgrades

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,480
on Saturday.

314
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,160
So I got that.

315
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,120
And of course, I mean, when you're off buying stuff,

316
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
you might as well get a new video iPod.

317
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Seeing as it is, the format everyone's talking about.

318
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,520
So I got a black iPod, one of the new ones that plays video.

319
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,200
And, well, you can imagine what I spent the rest of my week

320
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,240
and do, that's right.

321
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,840
Enjoying all of my porn.

322
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,480
Mm-hmm.

323
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a good line.

324
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
If we just don't weekend, I picked up a ticket.

325
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
I was mild to freeway every week.

326
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
And you're not shown who we are.

327
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,200
Would be rock stars now.

328
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,320
And yes, we like to roll up in those big ones.

329
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
This is Lori.

330
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
And this is Joe.

331
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
Together, we are a guy.

332
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,720
A girl and a bottle.

333
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,680
We have been listening to the daily source code

334
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
and have been worried about your cholesterol levels.

335
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,760
We also think that perhaps you haven't been as faithful

336
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,200
about listening to our podcast, Tis Tisk.

337
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,840
If you had listened to episode 8 of Guy Girl and a bottle,

338
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,880
we visited the Thomas Fogardy winery.

339
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,720
You would have learned as we did that Dr. Fogardy

340
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,560
is a world renowned vascular surgeon

341
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,480
who still practices medicine at Stanford Hospital

342
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
right here in Silicon Valley.

343
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,560
According to Dr. Fogardy, there is now evidence

344
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,840
that wine consumption has health accruing benefits.

345
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,800
The evidence has been validated and redocumented

346
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,000
in multiple additional studies.

347
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,840
We've also learned that the nitric oxide extracted

348
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,800
from the skins of grapes proves to be the active ingredient

349
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
that decreases the level of cholesterol

350
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,000
and bad lipids and increases the level of good lipids.

351
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,880
Elements from grape-scrinac extract also relax the blood vessels,

352
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,440
decrease the tendency for blood to clot

353
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,040
and create a blood pressure lowering effect.

354
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,720
Quoting the good doctor, wine by all scientific research

355
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
criteria should not be viewed so much as an alcoholic beverage

356
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,080
but more as a health food.

357
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,880
We couldn't agree more.

358
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,680
Follow us as we discover other interesting winearies, wines,

359
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,800
and health food in the in-around Silicon Valley.

360
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,800
You can find us at www.gngb.com or in iTunes.

361
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,920
By the way, there are some stellar woneries located

362
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,720
less than 15 minutes from your sugar daddies on sandhill road.

363
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,800
Why don't you bring the pod squad out and meet us

364
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,280
and we can visit a couple of our favorite woneries?

365
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,160
Oh yeah, I'm free.

366
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,240
Okay.

367
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,440
A bottle, the pod show crew,

368
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,680
after the sugar daddies and sandhill roadsie.

369
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,680
And this is Joe, she's a girl and we've got a bottle.

370
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,240
And you guys are nuts.

371
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,080
Thanks.

372
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,520
Hi, this is Ed from the Ed's Mixed Bad Podcast

373
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,840
and you're listening to The Daily Source Code

374
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,320
with the pod father Adam Curry.

375
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,880
Welcome to trackingtechnology.com.

376
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,000
I remember not that many years ago.

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,280
The only technology that drivers really used

378
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,480
was the telephone.

379
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,280
Using a laptop and GPS is kind of impractical.

380
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,480
The employee that you never asked for a year.

381
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,880
That's the perfect fit.

382
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,280
Yeah, that might be good.

383
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,920
This is a podcast where we talk to drivers, owner operators,

384
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,040
industry leaders, and company owners

385
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,560
about what drives their system.

386
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,640
The most important thing is that we have an always

387
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,880
platform.

388
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,680
If you go optimization, it is for every company

389
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,280
from one truck on up, either from a website

390
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,120
or integrated into a dispatched system,

391
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,760
or virtually everything that's in every store

392
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,920
is how at least once on a traffic system

393
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,640
is one that runs every day.

394
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
You don't think about it.

395
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,160
You don't have to worry whether or not

396
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,680
it's going to run today or tomorrow.

397
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,120
So subscribe today through iTunes or trackingtechnology.com

398
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,680
and learn what technology drives the trucking world.

399
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,080
There's just no excuse for not taking advantage of it.

400
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,240
Oh, that's right.

401
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,920
And there is a lot of technology out there.

402
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,840
And a lot of it now in the Curri condo.

403
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,760
So as you notice, I've been getting a lot of feedback

404
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,320
about my cholesterol levels.

405
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,240
Very indigreesive of feedback.

406
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,400
But pretty much everyone says the same.

407
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,080
More exercise, less fatty foods, and stop the smoking.

408
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,640
Well, we got two out of three.

409
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,480
So I got my track suit, got my dearest track suit

410
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,400
and because Patricia had forgotten to pack it for me.

411
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,520
And I'm not complaining because I do have the world's only

412
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,320
self packing and unpacking suit case.

413
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,680
At least on one segment of the trip, it packs and unpacks itself.

414
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,080
And she'd also neglected to put my swimming trunks in.

415
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,840
And we have a wonderful spa.

416
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,520
A spa here in the building, a hot tub spa.

417
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,600
Me and all my Asian women sitting in the spa.

418
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Me sniffing them.

419
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,680
They smell so wonderful and fresh.

420
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,920
So I went to, so yesterday, after I spent,

421
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,400
I don't know, I was up really late,

422
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,280
playing around and setting up and configuring.

423
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,320
It was beautiful, by the way.

424
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,440
Remember, I had my entire life on this one firewire drive.

425
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,600
So I just cloned it on both the new eye Mac

426
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,880
and on the power book.

427
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,800
And then slowly started to add the things that I needed.

428
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,200
And I'm very, very pleased.

429
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,840
And the speed is unbelievable.

430
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,440
The difference between my old power book G4, which

431
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,720
ran at one gigahertz, and the new one, which also, of course,

432
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,280
has a gigabyte of RAM, which is probably double what

433
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,560
I had in the G4, in hindsight, that's probably

434
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,800
one of the reasons why I was running rather slowly.

435
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,480
Oh, man, this thing just zips along.

436
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,920
I freaking love it.

437
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,480
So I stayed up nice and late.

438
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
And of course, I got the Wi-Fi in the condo.

439
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,600
So the power book went to bed with me.

440
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,440
And it just couldn't stop playing.

441
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,120
And then Sunday got up.

442
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,720
And then I had a, it was great because Patricia actually

443
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,480
video chatted me on the on eye chat.

444
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,720
I had just kind of like woken up.

445
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,760
Same time, you know, midday, oh, God, do I love sleeping

446
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,040
late?

447
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,480
And we talked for about two hours on the eye chat.

448
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,200
And it was great.

449
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,280
And I was able to show her to walk around and show her

450
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,840
everything.

451
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,040
And because she's, you know, she's only seen the condo kind of

452
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,480
pre, well, after she left after the vacation when both

453
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,000
the girls were out with me.

454
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,200
And yeah, it was good.

455
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,400
It's too bad about the Christina having a vacation.

456
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,720
She has a vacation all this week.

457
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,360
So she's off because that meant that, you know,

458
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,160
Christina's like me, she goes to bed really late.

459
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,680
And she loves to hack around on the computer

460
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,200
in the middle of the night.

461
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,640
And so she was still up otherwise.

462
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,720
I'm sure we could have worked out some cyber sex.

463
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,000
We always flash each other briefly, which is exciting.

464
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,120
Oh boy.

465
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,080
So you know, hit test today.

466
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,680
Yann has been sending almost one every single day.

467
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,680
But it's crazy how it works out because if I don't receive

468
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,560
a hit test in my Gmail, then loan behold,

469
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,240
there's always a backtracks podcast.

470
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,040
Backtracks podcast.

471
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,560
So you think you know your hits backwards and forwards?

472
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,400
Yes.

473
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,200
Do.

474
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Yeah, right.

475
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
It's the ready.

476
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,400
You're listening to the backtracks podcast exclusively

477
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,280
on the daily source code with Adam Curry.

478
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Hey, buddy, bring it on.

479
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,120
Yeah, Adam.

480
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,080
You know, bring it on, man.

481
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,680
Let's get right into this week's quiz.

482
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
I'm ready.

483
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,320
All right.

484
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,880
Here we go.

485
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,800
Here we go.

486
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,000
Let's do it.

487
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,160
Number one.

488
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
Number one.

489
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,520
Number one.

490
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,680
Hey.

491
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,920
So, I got it.

492
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I got it.

493
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,480
So, I got it.

494
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,160
You've been hit.

495
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,320
The tone you can hear.

496
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,920
It's a quiet ride.

497
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Come on, feel the noise.

498
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,600
Or it could be slate.

499
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,560
I think it's quiet ride.

500
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,120
Time's up.

501
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Number two.

502
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:41,400
I don't know.

503
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
I give up.

504
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Number three.

505
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I know this one.

506
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I think that's it.

507
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,600
Sound a lot like it.

508
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Time's up.

509
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Okay, here the answer.

510
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
All right.

511
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Number one.

512
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I'm here.

513
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Number two.

514
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I wonder what this one is.

515
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm here's number two.

516
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
I wonder what this one is.

517
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I'm walking in the rain.

518
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Walking in the rain.

519
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
That's good.

520
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Number three.

521
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Oh, you can hear it already.

522
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:51,840
Uh-huh.

523
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,600
86.

524
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
86.

525
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Sevent five.

526
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Five.

527
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Yeah.

528
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
So, how did you do, Adam?

529
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Two out of three.

530
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,560
Not bad today.

531
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,520
Thanks for joining us on this week's BackTract's podcast quiz.

Spin it back.

536
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,760
Thank you so much.

537
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,120
Oh, God.

538
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,200
You know, and I just sit here, stand, and swing, and and sing.

539
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,760
And I love it.

540
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,840
It really gets me going on a Monday morning, especially.

541
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,800
Thank you very much, back, trucks, podcasts.

542
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,480
So I had all my stuff together.

543
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,200
I had everything installed, and I figured, well,

544
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
let's see, I had some things I had to do.

545
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,040
New pod finder coming out tomorrow.

546
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,840
So I had to record the pod finder, send it off to my buddy Dave Fox.

547
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,880
Actually, I saw it came back already this morning.

548
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,280
He's on East Coast time.

549
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,600
So he gets, he gets to work around six.

550
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,280
He's very, very, very busy little beaver.

551
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,040
And so I was thinking, what kind of, oh, I, of course,

552
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,040
promised that if I had time, I'd put together a video

553
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,160
podcast.

554
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,040
And I really put a lot of thought into what I was going to do.

555
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,360
And it just doesn't make any sense to put a camera

556
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,200
on, you know, on me while I'm doing the source code.

557
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,000
In fact, I think it would be, I'm still,

558
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,840
you know, I want to keep those things kind of within the theater

559
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,000
of the mind, you know, I don't want you to see what I look

560
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,840
like when I'm doing this.

561
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,680
You've got your own image that you've conjured up in your mind.

562
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,320
So I, I figured what would be kind of cool

563
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,080
as to put, you know, it's this video stuff.

564
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,080
This is what I was working on in 2000.

565
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,360
I think it was 2000, started 2000.

566
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,960
I had a company called Jamby in the Netherlands.

567
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,760
And I think I told you this on Friday,

568
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,520
we were creating a kind of a, well, something very similar

569
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,240
to podcasting actually, where we had an application

570
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,400
which was built in Java.

571
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,960
And that was probably the downfall of the, of the whole.

572
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,280
Well, it wasn't the reason why it fell apart,

573
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,440
but it certainly didn't make things easier

574
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,440
because at the time, Macintosh was just migrating from OS9 to OSX.

575
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,600
I was a Mac user, you know,

576
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,400
so that made things very, very complicated, the Java stuff.

577
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,120
It worked, but then the swing set, as they called it,

578
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,440
didn't work too well in the beginning.

579
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,960
Huge memory and resource hog.

580
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,520
But the idea was, you had this, what we called it,

581
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,040
the JOP, right, the jerkoff platform.

582
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,040
And you would be able to share little video clips.

583
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,240
And at the time, we had, you know, broadband was just kind

584
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,080
of coming into play.

585
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
We had the always on connections.

586
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,120
And people were sharing, you know, wacky video clips

587
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
like crazy.

588
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,160
And, you know, we still do that today.

589
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,880
There's still all kinds of cool things going around.

590
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,720
And what we did is, very similar to what we're doing

591
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,040
now with podcasting is we said,

592
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,240
okay, we'll create the platforms

593
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,120
of people can share this stuff, but also show them how to make it

594
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,000
and we'll create content to port into the system.

595
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,760
And we were using a combination of Nutella,

596
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,880
or I think it was probably open nap at the time.

597
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Napster, to be able to share because, of course,

598
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,480
bandwidth was still a huge concern, particularly upload speeds.

599
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,560
So we were looking at Napster, to the Napster technology,

600
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,120
to share the videos and to transfer them complete peer to peer.

601
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,680
And RSS, to subscribe to different channels,

602
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,960
which, you know, was like here, what do we call them?

603
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,800
We didn't call them buddies.

604
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,680
We called them the Freedom Rangers.

605
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,600
And, in fact, the application was called the Freedom Controller.

606
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,880
It was, I'm telling you, it was great.

607
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,880
And it was so, absolutely the right idea,

608
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,000
but we just, we were way too fast.

609
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,920
We went to video before, we could even really do audio.

610
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,480
And, of course, at that point, the only portable player

611
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,040
was really the Rio.

612
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,480
And there was no content for it, except for the, well, actually,

613
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
I'm sorry, there was a lot of content for it,

614
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,280
but this was right around the time where Napster was getting

615
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,480
in the trouble and stuff was starting to blow up,

616
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,160
and which I think also really affected the Rio.

617
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,440
So it felt very natural to me to walk around my power book

618
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,080
and my eyesight recording the video that I use

619
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,520
for the Delta Shara Charlie Victor.

620
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,280
Number one, I hope you saw it.

621
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,080
If not, you can probably download it from dailysourcecode.com.

622
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,480
I think you, you'll probably have to right-click

623
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,680
or left-click whatever and download to disk before you play it

624
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,600
because I don't think the web server has been configured

625
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,040
to play the M4V files or M4A, M4V file, whatever it is

626
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,360
that the iPod uses.

627
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,440
But I found that it'd be very, very simple, you know.

628
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,560
Had three clips put them together, got some appropriate music

629
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,240
which was of course, well, go look at the video

630
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,840
and you'll see it.

631
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,040
And I put the whole thing together in about an hour

632
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,200
and hour and a half, something like that.

633
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,840
And then, you know, uploaded it, put in the podcast feed.

634
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,360
And I got a lot of great responses to it.

635
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,160
The most interesting thing, let me see if I can actually

636
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,120
bring up one of these Gmail feedbacks that I've gotten.

637
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,480
Here we go.

638
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,960
This is from Brian Know, who does the Frank Truth,

639
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,480
one of my guilty pleasures of listening to non-pod-safe music,

640
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,400
all about the life and times of Francis Albert to Nutripe.

641
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
Adam, just watched the video from Craig Condo,

642
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,960
a very cool and evocative.

643
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,480
Nice way to promote the music network, too, of course.

644
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,600
I actually had the place pretty much pictured as it is,

645
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,280
except not quite as warm in terms of furnishings for some reason.

646
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,560
And then Brian says, didn't greet the prospect

647
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,400
of video podcasts with much enthusiasm,

648
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,880
bandwidth production time, expense, as an old radio guy.

649
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,280
I just love audio, theater of the mind, as you put it.

650
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,640
But he did think it was cool.

651
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,720
And he also saw, oh, man, I got to point you towards this

652
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,960
Bush-madge mashup that Katya put on her feed.

653
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
It's very, very funny.

654
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,600
And also, Tiki Bar, as Brian says, is extremely cool.

655
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,480
So I guess I succeeded, I succeeded in bringing it

656
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
across the vibe that I want the condo to portray.

657
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,360
Now mind you, if I had done that video differently,

658
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,520
it might not have fit within your image there, Brian.

659
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,280
So video is man, we're just learning what all the different nuances

660
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,320
are in audio.

661
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,160
So the analogy goes to publishing with Microsoft Word,

662
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,240
you have paragraphs, you have fonts, you can make something

663
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,640
bold, you can italicize it, you can use paragraph, page breaks,

664
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,400
all kinds of ways to really try to express yourself

665
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,640
through text.

666
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,120
And in audio, we have compression, we've got the way you mix stuff,

667
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,200
we've got background music, we have the sound of the microphone,

668
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,440
all different ways to really accentuate what you're trying to,

669
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,240
or accentuate what you're trying to convey,

670
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,400
or whatever you're trying to create.

671
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,120
It's as a lot to it, there really is an in video.

672
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,680
Man, you just get a, well, you get one, not just one dimension,

673
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,840
but a whole shit load of dimensions along with it.

674
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,600
So I'm a firm believer though.

675
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,560
I think that there will be, there's going to be some very

676
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,360
interesting things happening with video podcasting.

677
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,880
I haven't quite seen the content yet that has blown me away,

678
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,600
but I'm pretty sure it's going to be short form.

679
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,000
And of course, definitely user-generated.

680
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hey Adam, this is a PD over at Lovehouse Radio.

681
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,360
I just wanted to thank you because now every time that I burp,

682
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,360
I think of Sincel and every time I see a tree in my front yard,

683
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,240
I think Sincel, so I'm thinking about coffee,

684
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,800
every time I move the grass, but I just wanted to let you know

685
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,520
there was kind of a reversed all this.

686
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,000
On Wednesday, I had the third of four dentist appointments

687
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,880
for a Rooknowing Crown.

688
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,440
And as usual, I took in my iPod and was catching up

689
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,840
on some of my podcast, and I was listening to your show

690
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
from, I guess, on Tuesday.

691
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,880
And you played a song on there from Carmen Tyler.

692
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,160
And right about the time the song started was the same time

693
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,160
they were putting together the cement for the temporary filling,

694
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,520
which happens to be the most got-offel smell ever.

695
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,440
So unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever be able to enjoy

696
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,880
a Carmen Tyler song or at least the song drifting

697
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,080
that you played without having that smell

698
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
somehow permeated into my nose.

699
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,840
So I just wanted to let you know there was a little danger

700
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,480
with the whole marketing thing, but for the most part, yeah,

701
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,600
I think Sincel, every time I belch.

702
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,160
So I just wanted to pass that along to you

703
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,400
and also to let you know that during my dentist appointments,

704
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,720
I have now turned my dentist on to podcasting.

705
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,720
So he kept asking what I was listening to when I let him know

706
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,320
and mentioned your show and CC's accident hash.

707
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,720
And he's now become hooked.

708
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,520
So taking easy, keep it rocking, keep it real,

709
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,000
and spread the love, love house radio, talk to you later.

710
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,360
All right, thank you very much, PD, PD love

711
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,920
from lovehouseradio.com.

712
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,760
You know, you're right, it's time to do some reprogramming.

713
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,040
For those of you who have only recently started

714
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,080
to listening to the daily source code,

715
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,000
hopefully you're subscribed if not, go to dailysourcecode.com.

716
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,920
Pick up the podcast feed or do that in iTunes.

717
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,440
You can search on daily source code or Adam Curry.

718
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,120
We've been doing this sound-vertising experiment.

719
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,840
And they seem to be working very well, though, of course,

720
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,400
they work and reverse as well.

721
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,720
Here's kind of how it works.

722
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,960
I'm going to help you out.

723
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,760
Let's see what we should do.

724
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,880
OK, you're on the road.

725
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,720
This will only work for people who are actually outside

726
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,360
and I guess on the road during our commute.

727
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,840
Now, I want you to look out for a motorcycle, OK?

728
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Look for a motorcycle.

729
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,080
There's bound to be one somewhere near you.

730
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,720
OK, you got it.

731
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,920
So we're going to call that the motor mouse, right?

732
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,200
M-M-50.

733
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,840
See the motorcycle?

734
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,560
You can't help but think motor mouse.

735
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,360
M-M motor mouse with the motorcycle M-M-50.

736
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,320
That's right.

737
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,280
What am I talking about?

738
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,520
The M-M-50.

739
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,200
When you see that motorcycle, now you won't be able to stop it.

740
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,680
What's probably going to happen is, even when you think of a motorcycle,

741
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,480
you're going to think M-M-50.

742
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,200
And what's real simple is you're going to think of those two wheels,

743
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,040
the motorcycle has you're going to think, two round speakers.

744
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,320
Is it working for you yet?

745
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,200
I'm not going to get through to you on this one.

746
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,520
All right.

747
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,040
So this is the first official sound-vertising test

748
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,200
of a real sponsor, the Logitech M-M-50.

749
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,560
How would you like that segue?

750
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,200
This is the device that I've been

751
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
raving about ever since I've actually been talking about

752
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,120
on the shows before the whole sponsorship deal started.

753
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,720
This is a portable, I call it like a breadboard.

754
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,600
It's about the length of a loaf of bread,

755
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,000
only what is it, maybe an inch and a half thick.

756
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,200
It comes in its own nice little portable carrying case.

757
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,800
And what it is is it's a portable amplifier, speaker set,

758
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,840
actually sound processor for your iPod.

759
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,040
And it has a slot in the middle between two speakers.

760
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,000
You've seen similar devices, I'm sure, although I've never

761
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,520
heard sound like this one.

762
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,640
You slide your iPod in and immediately connects

763
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,160
and it has a little remote, which is kind of like,

764
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,040
it's about the same size as the remote on the I-M-G-5,

765
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,120
which I'll gladly tell you about.

766
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,040
And with that, you can do the volume, you can advance,

767
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,160
you can pause, you can turn it on and off,

768
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,880
you can fast forward rewind, you can turn on the,

769
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,120
what is it, the surround sound system,

770
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,720
which is kind of cool, actually this surround sound

771
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,280
I've been digging that, it sounds pretty good.

772
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,200
And it also has an additional jack at the back

773
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,800
if you just want to connect up your computer.

774
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,160
Now that's what I've been doing.

775
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,000
I have it connected to the output of my Yamaha.

776
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,160
So the thing I play off of the G-Mac,

777
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,640
just off of the G-5, I-Mac, runs right through

778
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,880
the M-M-50 as unbelievable.

779
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,160
The sound fills up the condo, it's got a nice crisp,

780
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,360
kind of like, whoa, you can feel,

781
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,120
you can just feel almost the compression of the air.

782
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,400
It's really unbelievable how good this thing sounds.

783
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,800
And if you want to know more about it,

784
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,800
go to dailysourcecode.com and click on the picture

785
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,040
in the show notes of the M-M-50.

786
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,040
And I guarantee you, from now on, whenever you hear

787
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,480
the sound of a motorcycle, whenever you see those two wheels

788
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,520
spinning by, you won't help, but be able to think M-M-50.

789
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,000
And if it doesn't work, let me know, too,

790
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,320
because then I have to change my tactic.

791
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,480
So I'm from the pod safe music network right now,

792
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,320
as I scoured through it over the weekend.

793
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,320
This is a Elizabeth Longer quartet from New York.

794
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,520
I liked it because it was in French.

795
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,920
What do I do with you, what do I do...

796
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,080
I'll tell you with you, but I don't want to go for you.

797
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,560
I'll give you a thought with you, but you don't want to go for you.

798
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,800
I'll show you, from now on, but I don't want to go for you.

799
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,640
I'll tell you, with you, but I don't want to go for you.

800
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,880
What do I do...

801
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,320
So I'll do this and receive it,

802
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,320
I love you, I love you

803
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

804
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

805
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, I'll give you a break

806
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:28,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

807
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

808
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:58,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

809
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

810
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:16,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

811
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

812
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

813
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:39,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

814
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:46,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

815
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:53,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

816
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:04,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

817
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:24,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

818
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

819
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:42,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

820
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:53,320
I'll give you a break, but you don't want me, why?

821
00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

822
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:53,040
Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ka-ka-pa-pa, yeah yeah, yeah, ahh duh-hh,ega yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah.

823
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:59,320
at the Elizabeth Lonning Jure quartet, I think that's the way it pronounced it.

824
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:05,320
No ID3 tags, so I had to kind of switch back and forth, just says track 01, that's very helpful.

825
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,320
But can you tell that I'm kind of in my jazz mode recently?

826
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,320
I don't know, I'm just, I've learned a country to jazz, all kinds of stuff.

827
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Speaking of the, of the Podsive Music, now we're got another great podsive tune coming up

828
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,320
for it after the next promo.

829
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Let me see, I was talking about Christmas music.

830
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,320
And man, all I had to do was mention that we needed some podsive Christmas music,

831
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:35,320
since there's a whole bunch of stuff that you basically can't touch when it comes to the traditional

832
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Christmas carols.

833
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Well, the carols actually you can't touch, but you'd have to be able to cover something.

834
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,320
The Podsive Music network just filled up with all kinds of Christmas songs that people have put in together.

835
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:53,320
So I am still looking for the absolute Podsive Christmas hit, and I guarantee you're going to find it.

836
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
And when we do, oh man, we're going to play the crap out of it.

837
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
The page ingrétion from mommycast.com.

838
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,320

839
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Ah!

840
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Ah!

841
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320

To plug into the song.

862
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
The fruit is from me.

863
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,320
The memory.

864
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
The bridge hasn't all the melody.

865
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,320

00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,320
Todd, you can't forget to take this song for free.

00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
I'll play this song, it's free.

873
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Again, the bridge I wrote for free.

874
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,320
To plug into the song for you.

875
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
The memory.

876
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
The bridge hasn't all the melody.

877
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,320
That gets the song to where it's got the bridge.

878
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
Take the whole song for free.

879
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320

Take this song for free.

885
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,320
I don't know if you've had a love for it.

886
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,320
Like a song for free.

887
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,320
Someone just buys a seat.

888
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Take this song for free.

889
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:41,320
Take this song for free.

890
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Oh man, when I first heard that, it cracked me up.

891
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
I'm like, yeah, that's exactly the spirit.

892
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Todd Learner.

893
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,320
Song for free.

894
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
I don't know if songs for free.com exists.

895
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,320
But music.podshow.com certainly does.

896
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,320
And that's where you can find all kinds of great pod,

897
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,320
say music to play in your podcast.

898
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,320
And of course, it is for free.

899
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,320
And the song that I had to do is report back that you actually did it.

900
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
One other toy that I played with over the weekend.

901
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
What's that only 43 minutes down?

902
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
Time is moving fast.

903
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
One other thing that I played with over the weekend was my

904
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,320
brand new television.

905
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,320
I've been working, you know, playing with the,

906
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
with the Comcast cable box, which has,

907
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,320
I didn't know I had DVR in there.

908
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,320
It's got digital video recorder and Comcast is pretty cool.

909
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
They're getting close to some really good stuff, man.

910
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
We can go to the on demand.

911
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,320
And if you missed a particular series

912
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,320
from any of the premium channels and one of the networks,

913
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
they've already recorded it for you.

914
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
So I was able to watch Bill Mar.

915
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
I was able to watch the West Wing.

916
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Now I could set a timer so I can, you know,

917
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
anyway, so that's pretty cool.

918
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,320
But what I saw real in live in real time.

919
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
I don't know if it was a, if it was a repeat or not,

920
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,320
it was the actor studio.

921
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
Neither watch that on Bravo.

922
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,320
And Angelina Jolie was on, oh my God.

923
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
She's on the list, right?

924
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
We discussed that.

925
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,320
And she is definitely definitely on that list for me.

926
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,320
You know, the list that my wife and I have,

927
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
she has a list I have a list.

928
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,320
If you bump into this person, then that's okay.

929
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
Oh my God.

930
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
She's very intriguing.

931
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:15,320
And a wicked past, really, really interesting.

932
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,320
She's twisted in a very, very sexual way.

933
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
But if you ever chance to catch that,

934
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,320
definitely do because she answers a lot of questions

935
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
that you may have had about Angelina.

936
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,320
And she's also just a sweet girl with a lot of tattoos.

937
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
See, Alaska Pod Show.

938
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah, it's real.

939
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,320
We're no Adam Curry and we're no Don and Drew Show.

940
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,320
And we certainly didn't win any podcasting awards.

941
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
Because we're too new for that.

942
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
We're just podcasters.

943
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Pod casting from Anchorage, Alaska.

944
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
That's right.

945
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
I said Anchorage, Alaska.

946
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
We're the biggest state, you know.

947
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
We're bigger than Texas.

948
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,320
Who claim, if Alaska melted, we would be the biggest state.

949
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,320
What a bunch of crap that is.

950
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,320
Anyway, if you got a pod show, you got a gig.

951
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,320
You got a promo.

952
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Kick it to us and we'll plug in.

953
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,320
And if you're a subscriber,

954
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,320
you can go over to our website at www.lascapodshow.com

955
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
and read the show notes.

956
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Because you would really have nothing else to do.

957
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
Pod Show.

958
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
Content that will make you squeeze the dog

959
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
and burp your mother.

960
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
Pod.

961
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
Pod.com

962
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
Don't get mad.

963
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,320
Get media.

964
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,320
Manpaw.

965
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
I this is Jay Donley from ad pod.com

966
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,320
and we are thrilled that we are on Adam Curry's daily source code.

967
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,320
And he is the pod father of pod casting.

968
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
That's like being on Leno for television.

969
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,320
But he really liked our very metal interview.

970
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,320
But it sounds interesting.

971
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
But it sounds interesting.

972
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
I definitely want to hear the Barryman.

973
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
I like Barryman a lot of stuff.

974
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
He really likes Barryman.

975
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
I like Barryman a lot of stuff.

976
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,320
And I float it down, made it into a ballad.

977
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,320
And that's what he was hearing.

978
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,320
So does that mean that Adam Curry listens to mad pod?

979
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,320
But it sounds interesting.

980
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,320
I definitely want to hear the Barryman.

981
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
I like Barryman a lot.

982
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,320
Pod.com

983
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,320
I this is Shadow Steel.

984
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,320
And you're listening to your global audio connection.

985
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,320
Madpod.com

986
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
This is Jay Donley.

987
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
So check out Madpod.com.

988
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
We have interviews from the past and present.

989
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
So remember, don't get mad.

990
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Get media.

991
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
Madpod.

992
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
Shadow Steel or whatever mother.

993
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
That's a district truck named.

994
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,320
I think there are 25 Shadow Steel's running on the country right.

995
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,320
Madpod.com

996
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
So Adam, what about me, man?

997
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
What about me, Jay Donley?

998
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,320
I'm the one who made the promo.

999
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,320
I'm the one who sent you the promo.

1000
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Hey, don't leave Madpod.com

1001
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Not Shadow Steel.

1002
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
My shadow's my partner.

1003
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,320
It's all about getting exposure for more shows, right?

1004
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Madpod.com

1005
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,320
Jay Donley, everybody along with Shadow Steel on a madpod.

1006
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,320
You see, actually after I said that,

1007
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,320
that probably wasn't the original Shadow Steel.

1008
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
I got an email that says, what are you going to talk about?

1009
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
I am the only Shadow Steel.

1010
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,320
I think it was probably Shadow Stevens.

1011
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,320
I was shinkin' of.

1012
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
Okay, let's do one more time.

1013
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,320
Jay Donley, Shadow Steel or the madpod.

1014
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Okay.

1015
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
So here's what's on the agenda for me today.

1016
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
Today, actually, pretty late.

1017
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
My buddy Julia's coming up from Los Angeles.

1018
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
Going to meet her around 11 at the office.

1019
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,320
Julia used to work with me at our previous company.

1020
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,320
Think new ideas.

1021
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,320
She ran all corporate technology.

1022
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,320
She ran a lot of technology for us.

1023
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,320
And she lives in Los Angeles.

1024
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,320
Can't convince her to move to California.

1025
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
She's in California.

1026
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,320
She moved to San Francisco to come and work with us.

1027
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,320
So I figured, well, I'll bring her up a wine and diner.

1028
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,320
And then she'll probably have a whole bunch of other cool people.

1029
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
She'll turn her son to ours.

1030
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,320
She found our temporary space.

1031
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,320
She's been really, really good to us.

1032
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,320
So I'm going to go hang out with with jewels.

1033
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,320
And tomorrow there's this big Google thing called the zeitgeist.

1034
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
It's like a Google media conference.

1035
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
So I'm definitely going to check that out.

1036
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
I've been thinking about clandestine recording

1037
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,320
because everyone who's anybody in the valley will be there.

1038
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,320
So if I don't, well, you know what Steve Gilmore will be there.

1039
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
He'll be recording everything.

1040
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
So let him do that.

1041
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,320
I should hope at least Steve.

1042
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,320
Okay, data source code.com is where you can find the latest episode for the daily source code.

1045

Just go to iTunes and the search for daily source code.
