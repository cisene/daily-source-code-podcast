00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Seven

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Six

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There are no secrets

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Intermediate you

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000

Adam Curry

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000

Strap to my ass

Done the next generation radio content in my ears

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You don't need us

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thinking crazy

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You should be sure

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm guessing

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's a battle curry

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good morning everybody

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In the affluent Surrey Subherpa

Kilford

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is your daily source code

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
276

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
odd father and transit

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Only back in the cottage for about

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
20 hours

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Then I'm off to Los Angeles

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For the expo

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're talking about that about pot save music

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On some other stuff

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sure we'll conjure up

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's Wednesday

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's Wednesday

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's Wednesday

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Stepped out of my doorstep

37
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wednesday

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Morning look real fun

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Took a glance at my wristwatch

40
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Getting in my breath a time

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let my little girl

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sitting pretty in the bed

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's just my arms

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I trust this guy

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Time to clear my weary fear

46
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Wednesday morning

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Take my blues away

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wednesday morning

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's gonna be a part of the day

50
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wednesday morning

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's come so many times before

52
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I used to cry

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I want to pull my life

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But I'm not going too many more

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With a miss Johnson

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I saw school boys skipping by

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Took a dome

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
To my head

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What I feel

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What I have

61
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Climb my hands

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Kicked up my feet

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Dance around

64
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They're y'all so sweet

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
At least I'm doomed

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But I see

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The music was a treat

68
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It was a step on a hand

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Take my blues away

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wednesday morning

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's gonna be a part of the day

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Wednesday morning

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's come so many times before

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I used to cry

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to pull my life

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I'm not going too many more

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000

I want to pull my life

100
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I want to pull my life

101
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to pull my life

102
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000

I want to pull my life

121
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I want to pull my life

122
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,800
It's called so many times before

123
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,100
They used to fly over for my night

124
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,900
But I might go to

125
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,000
Not go to it, whoa

126
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,500
Not it, whoa

127
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500

Not it, whoa

144
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Not it, whoa

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000

146
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000

Not another one, no, in all

152
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Not it, whoa

153
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,360
When's the morning? You can find that on the pod save music.

154
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,080
Connect, we're going to music.podshow.com.

155
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
Well, good morning, everybody.

156
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,960
Coming to you from from the curry cottage.

157
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
Boy, what a what a whirlwind trip I had the past two days.

158
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,840
Oh, I hear all kinds of hum and stuff here.

159
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,880
What the hell was going on?

160
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,600
I have to. I slept in microphone, I think.

161
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,920
Oh, so I'm sorry about yesterday's show.

162
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,240
The travel schedule and the meetings and oh, man,

163
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,080
everything was messed up.

164
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,360
But for those of you just joining the daily source code wondering what I'm talking about,

165
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,960
I received a couple messages two days ago that the record industry and also the broadcast

166
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,400
industry in in the Netherlands and more than likely in other countries in Europe

167
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,960
were banding together and are going to put their foot down on licensed music being played

168
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,640
on podcast.

169
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,320
And so I had an opportunity to go talk to a couple of European parliament members about

170
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,000
this. So I jetted off.

171
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,760
Now, the European parliament is kind of divided between Brussels and Luxembourg.

172
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,520
And it's supposed to be like one month or in Brussels, the next month or in Luxembourg,

173
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,720
it could be longer than a month.

174
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,440
But pretty much they're divided and people are all over the place.

175
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,240
And I guess some of those parliament members have a banking business in Luxembourg

176
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,480
that look down there as well.

177
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,920
And I really was really wanted to go there and talk to some people.

178
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,840
Well, for two reasons, one, I wanted to find out what what the general consensus was,

179
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,560
what the thought was, there is different thinking in Europe about things like patents,

180
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,680
although laws are now being put up and past that may or may not be what everyone would like

181
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,240
who deals with patents.

182
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,640
There's a lot of copyright issues that are being discussed and directives are being created.

183
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,160
And so he was a great opportunity for me to go and talk to some folks about it.

184
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,320
And certainly did.

185
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,240
The other part, of course, was G's.

186
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,800
Is there no way we can find that we can kind of use some kind of,

187
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,720
you know, I'll be honest about it.

188
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,520
If I can use political leverage to turn around in our advantage, I'll do that.

189
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,800
Because isn't there some way we can figure this out.

190
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,880
But essentially, here's what it boils down to.

191
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,520
Using licensed music on podcast will only work if a form of DRM is implemented,

192
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,840
so that after a certain amount of time, the show, the show that you created,

193
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,760
basically dries up and goes away.

194
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,480
And by the way, I have to say, I'm not completely against that.

195
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,240
I think there are, you know, shows have a shelf life.

196
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,680
My show has a much shorter shelf life than Don and Drew's, for example.

197
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,240
They have, oh man.

198
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,760
I think some people have every single episode of Don and Drew and the creating entire archives

199
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,200
and collections and CDs and there's a whole subculture of that.

200
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,880
But source code is, you know, I don't think there's much reason to go back and listen to one.

201
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,160
Because I'm basically promoing shows that you want to check out today and, you know,

202
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,760
so the shelf life much shorter.

203
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,760
So I wouldn't mind if the show went away, but, you know, then you come into the whole issue.

204
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,480
Well, then you have to use digital rights management or DRM for short.

205
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,560
And that means that, you know, you can resort to only really a couple of different types.

206
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,080
It'll be, um, uh, well, I guess, looking at the, uh, looking at the portable player market

207
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,640
if you want to have, and that's really what it's all about.

208
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,320
You know, this is not because, oh, gee, I need to play licensed music.

209
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,760
So badly on my show, but I also want to give my audience what they want.

210
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,600
So that's, you know, the audience loves the hit test.

211
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,200
The audience loves mashups, not all of them, but, um, so that's why I want to do that.

212
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,560
You know, not, not like, oh boy, you know, I want to be in with the hip crowd and want to play

213
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,720
J-Lo, no, that's not necessarily it.

214
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,440
So it's, it's a request, you know, and, and that'll only work if it, um, if it's DRM,

215
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,040
and the only way to DRM it to keep my audience would be basically to use apples.

216
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,680
What does it fair play? I think is what they use, um, and I'm sure there's the be a way.

217
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,800
So, well, it won't be copyable. I don't know if they can make a show expire or not.

218
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm sure they can, you know, then maybe just adapt the software somewhat.

219
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,440
But then, you know, how about all the other folks who don't use, um, iTunes and iPods.

220
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,040
So I don't see a workable solution there. Maybe maybe maybe all the bulls DRM would be applicable.

221
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,600
But I'm not quite sure we're that with all of their initiatives. And, and again, you know,

222
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,360
this is still kind of about the free airways, you know, that's, that's the whole point.

223
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,840
So, and I went through tirelessly explaining that, you know, that it's a good thing,

224
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,760
and that, you know, the only presumption that I kept hearing over and over as well,

225
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,440
it's too easy to steal the song. Well, first of all, you know, and hit test and mashups.

226
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,520
It ain't that easy to steal the song. You can't undo the mashup and the hit tests or just little snippets.

227
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,240
But, you know, it just, it was back and forth and they keep coming back to,

228
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,880
well, you guys have to give a little, said, no, fuck you. I didn't say fuck you. I said,

229
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:55,080
said, you know, why should we have to do that? You know, this is, it's so backwards everything.

230
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,320
It's not like we live and die by the 1.5 million songs that are available online, you know,

231
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,920
to download and put on your music player that you pay for. You know, it's not about that.

232
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,600
It's a more of a cultural thing. I mean, G's songs have been passed down through,

233
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,920
through the ages, through history, people sing traditional songs. And of course, those that are in

234
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,240
in the public domain, we can continue to use witness jingle bells, which is, as you look at the

235
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,000
podcast music network. There's a great new version of that. But it's also an opportunity to

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,400
to create new music. And that's really the only direction I guess we can go into promote new music

237
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,000
is through pod save. And by the way, I'm so I was in Brussels in the next day in Luxembourg.

238
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,680
And I have to say that, yeah, I got the attention. Yeah, we had the meetings, but everybody in

239
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,160
those two places were completely focused on France, man. Wow, people are running freaking

240
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,200
scared about what's going on there. In case you haven't heard about it. And I must say there's been

241
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,640
quite a lack of mainstream media attention for what's happening. There are riots for two weeks now.

242
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:11,480
And the riots seem to consist of mainly like 14 to 18-year-old young men, predominantly from poor

243
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:18,840
areas in France. They're pretty much all from Northern Africa, from Algeria. And I guess they're

244
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,520
fed up with their situation. And the way they're expressing that is by writing on the streets. But

245
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,200
really the one thing that seems to have caught on is the idea of burning cars. That seems to

246
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,480
get all the attention. And so I think now, as of the count from last night, there's over five

247
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,960
and a half thousand. Can you imagine that five and a half thousand cars have been burned?

248
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,920
There's already been one death. There's been 1,500 arrests. And it's a big mess. And I think it's

249
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,480
by the way, I'm not one of these people who thinks that, oh, this is a Muslim problem. I think this

250
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,040
is a government problem. It's happening all over Europe where Europe invited a lot of Eastern

251
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,440
nations to come on in. Because plenty of work will give you health care. We'll give you child care

252
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,520
and come on in. Come on over. And we got plenty of jobs for you. And they did a horrible

253
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:21,880
shitty job with integrating these groups of people. And now we have second generation who are

254
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,360
not integrated have very little hope. And this is how they choose to express that, which I

255
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,280
obviously don't think is the best way to do it. And by the way, where are the parents saying,

256
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,560
hey, yo, dude, get your ass in here before I kick it and put down that rock, put down that

257
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,240
on the Dove cocktail. So anyway, they're all freaked out because this is something that could

258
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,720
easily spark to any number of countries. We're already seeing a little bit of this happening in

259
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:55,880
Germany and Berlin. I think there was a couple of basically copycat actions that took place in

260
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,360
Brussels itself. You hear that? No, I don't have a minute. I forget keep forgetting to turn my

261
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:09,080
Skype off every single time I start to show. Another country where this could just explode would

262
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,880
be the Netherlands. So that, you know, phones were ringing off the hook and these guys, these

263
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:20,680
Parliament members, are they Parliamentarians? Parliamentarians? That was like a really just

264
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,520
called the Parliamentarians. They kind of are that way, I guess. So long, long, long, long,

265
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:34,120
story short. Not very successful. It's completely hammered into my head that the only way to go

266
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:41,800
for me at least and I'll advise my fellow podshow podcasters and anyone else who's listening

267
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,520
within the sound of my voice to be very, very careful what you're doing because they, you know,

268
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,280
look, if these guys can go out and sue college kids, high school kids, grandmonds, sounds great,

269
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:59,480
doesn't it? They're suing grandmothers. Me up to the tune of 150 grand. I'm sure that they'll be

270
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,720
happy to take on some podcasters and we're all very, very visible. In fact, we're all going to be

271
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,000
damn visible at the, at the expo, at the end of the week, this, this upcoming weekend. So,

272
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:17,480
thank you very much, Koso and Katya, they already created proud to be pod save logos,

273
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:25,800
little music player there with a condom over his head, fantastic. So I received many, many,

274
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,000
many comments that had some time to look over them last night in this morning. And there's one

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,040
thing that did disturb me a little bit. People saying, well, you're not being transparent about

276
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,600
the pod safe music network, because pod show owns it and you're driving people towards your music.

277
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,400
And I'm like, whoa, let's just back up one second and evaluate what the pod safe music network is.

278
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:52,440
Okay. This was built more than half a year ago before they're even, we started on this before

279
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,480
there was a pod show company, even. And Ron and I funded it out of Bro Pocket because we were

280
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,160
excited about what was happening. Ron's in musician. I'm, you know, I'm a, I'm a dumb blonde DJ VJ.

281
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,320
And we were excited about the prospects of what this could be. The only reason for this

282
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,520
pod save music network is to act as an exchange. And the exchange is based upon a very simple

283
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,320
license that is kind of agreed upon once you sign up as a podcaster and once you sign up as an

284
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,720
artist. And it's an agreement that, hey, look, the art, you can play this song and promote it,

285
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,320
along as you report back to the network that you played it. And of course, there's links to the

286
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,960
artist's websites all over the place. And it's, at this point, it's up to the artist to monetize

287
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:40,200
on that. Certainly with our unlabel idea, we want to help musicians to monetize on that.

288
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,480
And for the, for the artists, they have every right to take their song off the pod safe music network.

289
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,360
It's, it's really, it's quite open. Go ahead, read the terms. If you have an issue with the terms,

290
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,200
bring them up so we can discuss them. We've done that in the past and we'd be happy to adapt the

291
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,360
terms if it seems to be the right thing to do. But there's, except for maybe a little bit of advertising,

292
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,160
there's no huge monetization scheme in place for sending people to the pod safe music network

293
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,680
other than it's just easy. You know, shit, the, the term pod safe, I think Dave Winner and I came

294
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,360
up with that a year ago, perhaps, maybe a little less now. But just, you know, it's like,

295
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,480
come on, people, yeah, go to garageband.com. You can do it. You can get stuff there. And if there's

296
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,760
no blanket license, if you get something from garageband.com, so you still have to do the work. I just

297
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,840
want to, basically, I want to make it easier for myself. Give me a place where I can always go to,

298
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,640
don't have to think about whether I can play this on my podcast, just know that if I like it,

299
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,400
I can play it on my podcast. And the benefits of the pod safe music network is that podcasters report.

300
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,760
So right now, I think we only have the top 10 of all time. We're coming out with the top 10 plays

301
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,800
of the month of the week and of the day. And you can see which show has played, what songs?

302
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,240
It's a great referral network. That's, that's all that it is. So to Molly, particularly, who wrote

303
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,920
a just a nasty comment, like dude, you know, come on, give a little bit of credit here for the work

304
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,800
that CC Chapman and Chris Rockwell did and Sue, you know, they put this together.

305
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,480
Okay. Anyway, so I'm very excited about moving forward and putting this behind us.

306
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,400
It really blows because man, do I love the mashups? I really love the mashups. Lots of people

307
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,200
saying, hey, why don't you do pod safe mashups? Well, if anyone sent me a great pod safe mashup,

308
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,440
I'd use it. I haven't heard anything that I liked. And of the thousands of mashups that I've

309
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,120
received, I've only played a very small portion because I thought they were good enough. And some

310
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,680
of them probably even sucked too bad. But I wanted to put a mashup on. And I'm bummed, you know,

311
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:49,240
like the backtracks podcast, fantastically produced stuff, really cool, young polette. He's, and

312
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,880
polette is bummed out, really, really bummed out. Because, you know, this was kind of one of the things

313
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,920
that he had a lot of passion doing it. And we never had any financial range when he just sent me

314
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,480
stuff and had happily play it. And of course, he had, you know, maybe to make like 20 or 30 bucks

315
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,520
a month from the iTunes links because there is no money in being a middleman in the licensed

316
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:17,320
music business. Ask Steve Jobs, he's making pennies, ask Napster, ask Rap City. These guys

317
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,200
are not making money. They have to give up so much to all these different agencies with their

318
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,720
handout that they're literally stifling everything. So what I'm trying to do now is inspire

319
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,640
young to come up with something new, some other new short form feature because it's really

320
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,360
truly is he's a great short form feature producer. So I'm hoping that it'll, they'll come up with

321
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,120
some more stuff. And hey, young, anything you want to try, man, just send it to me. No,

322
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,320
and all that throw it right on. So we will talk about the podcast Expo today.

323
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,920
When I wrote on a couple of things here, man, I have such a busy day. I have a whole list of

324
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,880
things I have to take care before I go. Because here's the deal. I'm going to,

325
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,120
what time are we at now? I'm going to Los Angeles, then I drive straight up to Ontario.

326
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:12,200
Thursday night is the Podsafe Acoustic Jam that I guess the Podsafe Music Network is actually

327
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,560
underwriting it. Oh, gee. More money out of pocket. But it's good, you know. I think Brother

328
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,360
Love is coming. He's going to do an Acoustic set. I have no idea. CC Chapman is arranging all of that.

329
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,160
So I'm very, very excited to see what kind of vibe we can create. Then of course Friday and

330
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,400
Saturday is the Expo. Sunday, back in San Fran Monday, in the office for just a little bit,

331
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:43,480
then I got to go to Washington, Seattle, Washington, to speak before all of the brand,

332
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,680
I think it's the brand managers and media buyers of Johnson and Johnson. Dude, those guys make a lot

333
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,040
of stuff. You may think they just do a certain amount of products, but they actually do

334
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:02,360
an Acubu lenses or they own the companies. So that's Tuesday, Tuesday morning, then I hop on a flight

335
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,360
back and then I'm in the office Wednesday. And then Thursday, I have to, well, have to, then I'm

336
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,120
coming back already because Patricia is paying, don't tell them, okay. Then I'll have a computer,

337
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,760
so I don't think they'll hear it, but Patricia's going to pay her dad who just turned 80 a surprise

338
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,520
visit this weekend. So I have to be home to take care of the end of Christina's going to. So I have

339
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,280
to stay home to take care of the cottage and the dogs and then I'll be home for

340
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,400
thing two weeks and then off again just before the holidays. So plenty of Gmail to go through,

341
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:37,400
I don't know if I'm going to get to most of it. And brand new is the promo upload system.

342
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,040
I got to come up with a better name for that. If you go to promos.podshow.com,

343
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,120
there's basically a WordPress weblog there. You register, you can set up your own username and password,

344
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,280
and then you can create your own post and just throw the URL in anywhere on that post,

345
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,240
you know, just copy and paste it wherever you put up a file on your server and it will automatically

346
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,280
be turned into the podcast feed, which you can subscribe to, down at the bottom, there's a little

347
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,640
link to the RSS feed. And now the promo is just drop right into my system automatically. It is so

348
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,720
incredibly cool. And of course, you know, you could also subscribe to the feed. And if you're

349
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,120
if you've got a podcast that you're, you know, might want to promo some other stuff on,

350
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,880
you're welcome to use it. So, let me give you a couple of those and I'll be right back.

351
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,720
This is Mr. Morgan. And this is Qdog. And we're from cool shot on the tube.

352
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:42,360
What is cool shot Mr. Qdog? Cool shot is a movie reviews. It's talking about TV. It's talking about

353
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:50,520
pop culture. It's talking about a lot of shit. A lot of shit. A lot of shit. And this is what some

354
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,840
of our listeners have had to say about us. I love cool shot on the tube. It's possibly one of the

355
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,440
best five guests I've ever listened to. Thank you, Governor Arney. You're welcome. Now one of

356
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,960
that you missed the Billy Conley. I think it's brilliant. I've never heard anything like it in my

357
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,680
way. If you like listening to people talking about movies, people having a good time, people

358
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,040
hacking on each other, you should come to cool shot on the tube. Listen to us. I have a good time.

359
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:26,680
We're about that. www.co.sh-h-i-t-e. That's far as I'm concerned. I had never listened to any

360
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,280
other podcast. I mean, who would do that?

361
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Well, Australia, Adam.

362
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,040
Australia? But are you really listening? I don't think you heard non-terrace yet.

363
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,200
Everybody up to date on non-terrace, our podcast. My name is Sandra tonight. And I'm an

364
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,400
of blonde, also known as the blonde. I'm the blonde, natural blonde, 100%. And I am the

365
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:03,080
brunette. That's right. My life is nothing, like the pages of Us Weekly. But I live in LA.

366
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,520
I work in Hollywood. Here I have all of these very talented friends. And I wanted a place where

367
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,160
I could showcase these talents. And let's talk about what real life is like for us, right?

368
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:19,640
What a lot of animals in Hollywood. For bringing light to what can still easily be glossed over

369
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,560
as a programmer and Hollywood life. We're going to include a little music. Yes.

370

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,960
No, hardly hold their podcast arena.

377
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,480
Oh, I love my corny in the man football. I couldn't even hear before, just for the rest

378
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,040
that it's on the MXL. All right, he's saying you're going to hell. Keep your pace with the

379
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,400

380
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,560

384
00:24:47,080 --> 00:25:04,800
Hi everyone, this is Rev Tim from the Rev Tim podcast, fresh from the San Francisco Bay area.

385
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,920
Now if we can bring you a little bit of hope and inspiration, our job has been accomplished.

386
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,160
We want to help you build positive relationships with your spouse, with your children,

387
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,720
with your friends at your workplace and just help you to find out how God wants you to be a better person in this life.

388
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,320
You know, God has a plan and a purpose for your life.

389
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,840
It is not for disaster, but it's to give you a hope and a future.

390
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Check it out, the Rev Tim podcast.

391
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,880
Just go to Rev Tim.com and click on the show no point.

392
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:47,080
Yeah, Rev Tim, I have a feeling he'll be at the podcast or it's not actually podcast.

393
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,800
It was the portable media expose what it's called and on Tereo this coming weekend.

394
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
So here's what I've been thinking about.

395
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm going by the way, that's probably clear right now.

396
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,840
I've received so many emails from people saying, hey man, looking forward to seeing you there.

397
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,640
I'm like, oh, this is going to be horrible because the last thing I want is to this is how it usually goes.

398
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,040
You know, you're talking to someone someone else comes up and then,

399
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,440
oh, can I talk to you about this and I, oh, I want to say this and hey, just one second and it's and I love the attention.

400
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Don't get me wrong, but it's just, it's not productive to have any real meaningful conversations.

401
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:35,000
So here's what I'd like to do for today when you hear this, please send me an email sent it to atomoodcurry.com and put in the subject line,

402
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:48,120
which we make it easy, see you at PME, there you go, see you at PME and just so I know who's there because I want to try and set up some,

403
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,520
I'm going to be there for a couple of days, so I want to try and set up some kind of schedules that I can meet with people who want to meet,

404
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:01,120
you know, I want to hook up, I'd love to put some faces to some voices and lots of people have questions and would like to know,

405
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:12,440
you know, how maybe they can work with us, just send it to atomoodcurry.com, see you at PME and so I can kind of put a list together and then we'll be on a lookout for you.

406
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:27,440
I've got to find a place where we can have, you know, I think what we're putting together is a place where we can meet and chill and this also goes for pod squadters,

407
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:35,440
members of the pod squad who are already in the family. This is your very impersonal invitation.

408
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:43,440
It's just too much, this, you know, everybody wants to talk and everyone wants to hang out. So I'm going to try and coordinate as much as possible.

409
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:52,440
And if we don't get around to it, you know, please don't be pissed off, you know, it's just as I guess there's 2,000 people coming or something.

410
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,440
And I pretty much assume that every person who's going to be there is is very enthusiastic and interested in podcasting and has lots of questions.

411
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,440
And so hopefully we can get that all together. A couple of pieces of feedback I want to share with you today.

412
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Yeah, my really want to get this out because again, it's just bugging me. I heard your podcast Monday regarding what the record companies are doing again.

413
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:26,440
And I'm not in the recording business, but I really am getting frustrated by everything sounding the same, looking the same.

414
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,440
And here it is, you know, there is this great tool we have. It's podcasting.

415
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,440
I'm one of a hundred million people ready to embrace something different.

416
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I mean, if an artist can understand that this is a great on-ramp to get notice, I mean, I'm ready to give you money. I promise I will.

417
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,440
And there's people out there, all they want to, they're tired of the radio.

418
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:57,440
They're tired, they want, they're looking for juice, they're looking for something that's exciting, that's real.

419
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,440
And you can tell the fake stuff from the good stuff.

420
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,440
And please, all I'm saying to anybody out there with talent, let it out there.

421
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:13,440
I mean, if I had some talent, I don't care about the money so much right now as it is, to let your gift out there for the masses to know what it is.

422
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,440
And that's what pop you. We've got to stay together on this because podcasts are right on this.

423
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,440
This is a correct way of going. And this is what's going to make us win in the long end, long run.

424
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,440
It is because it's right. And it's about time we all stand up to all the BS out there.

425
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,440
And we say, no, this is how it's going to happen because we need it.

426
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,440
This is a change that is going on now. And if you don't do it this way, guess what we get?

427
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,440
The same old crap day in and day out. I'm tired of it.

428
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,440
No way, the door has been open just a little bit. And that's enough for me.

429
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,440
And I hope it's enough for millions of other people out there.

430
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Thanks.

431
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Right, I'm Mark.

432
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
Thank you very much for this feedback.

433
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Well, it's true, you know. And by the way, that repetition, it's kind of, it's logical.

434
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,440
It's not mainstream media's fault, you know.

435
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,440
They can't narrow cast or do only like the roadhouse podcast, you know, you can't.

436
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,440
It just won't work. It's, you can't get an audience big enough to justify the infrastructure needed to broadcast that.

437
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:21,440
And, you know, even clear channel only has, you know, only has, you know, 2,000 radio stations that they own and control.

438
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Well, podcast alley, I think just passed 10,000 podcasts.

439
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,440
You know, so it's obvious that this is, it's a breakout, you know, you're right.

440
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,440
It is totally a breakout. And I predict that within the next couple of years what will happen is there will be a meltdown.

441
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Podcasting will make licensed RIA, licensed music irrelevant, irrelevant in culturally irrelevant.

442
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Let me put it that way because I think people are migrating more, you know, everyone has time for their independent stuff.

443
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:57,440
That's just becoming more, you know, people are tuning out to tuning out from mainstream and tuning in a little bit more to the alternative side.

444
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,440
All it takes is a little bit of trust in your customers.

445
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,440
So I do predict that once, you know, the math is really simple on this stuff.

446
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,440
But once you get to the point where you have a song that people like.

447
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Let's say there's the, right now we have 10,000 podcasters.

448
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:22,440
I think that it would be possible for one song to catch enough fire for 10% a thousand podcasters to, to want to play that song because they really dig it.

449
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,440
I think that's, that's very, very possible.

450
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
We might not have hit it yet.

451
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Maybe we have and we just haven't been able to track it properly yet. I'm not sure.

452
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Now, it's also not completely unthinkable that each of those thousand podcasters would have a thousand listeners, you know.

453
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,440
I think that's that's reasonable.

454
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:51,440
I think I think that there's plenty of shows out there that have anywhere from 500 to 5000 listeners and definitely more than a thousand.

455
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
So what if they all played one track?

456
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Well, when we do the math, a thousand times a thousand is a million. So you'd have a million people hearing that track.

457
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,440
Now, of course, there's some crossover you may be subscribed to the same show, but come on.

458
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,440
It's a much better tracking mechanism than being used right now for radio with people filling out diaries.

459
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,440
And then there's this BDS system. It's just, it's an old fashioned system.

460
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,440
But when we have, you know, when we're able to expose music to a million people, watch the back catalog open up.

461
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Please, it'll happen. It really will.

462
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,440
And there's so much untapped money there.

463
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:38,440
There's, you know, there's back catalogs are huge, much larger than the one and a half million songs that's available on iTunes today.

464
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,440
It's just a matter of giving people access to it and the people want it.

465
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
So I think that's probably what happened.

466
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:51,440
And this will happen across the board. Once it's evident how large this movement is and how many people are participating in it.

467
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:59,440
I think we're going to see some changes until then, you're right. I'm really excited about a lot of the new music and the artists that are out there.

468
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Still want to talk about the, because the interesting wired article I read about the podcast, the podcast expo, the portable media expo.

469
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
There's other places you can meet up with podcasts.

470
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:17,440
If you can't make it to the expo, there are these, you probably heard of meetup dot, I think it's meetup.com, we'll meetup.org, meetup.com, I think.

471
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,440
Well, the meetups. So there's podcasts or meetups.

472
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
And in San Francisco, there's one.

473
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
I think it's the first Wednesday of every month.

474
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,440
I have successfully been able to schedule my flights wrong every single time.

475
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,440
So I haven't been able to attend a single one.

476
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,440
But I do know that lots of pod show folks go there and there's audio folks and podcasters.

477
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,440
And I believe Michael Butler actually organizes these. Now actually, I'm sure he organizes them.

478
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:50,440
And someone sent me a piece of audio from the most recent one, which must have been just the other night.

479
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,440
It's really nice to hear what what people I work with think about me.

480
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
So please ask questions.

481
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
This is Michael Butler.

482
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
The meetup.

483
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,440
My name is Kevin Ostrowski.

484
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,440
I've yet to have a podcast, but I'm working on a few ideas.

485
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,440
I work over at Pod Show.

486
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,440
Well, is the name of that company?

487
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Pod Show.

488
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
Okay.

489
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I understand some other cool people work there too.

490
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Yeah, we got a nice crew.

491
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,440
And here's another developer.

492
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.

493
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm here for the drinks.

494
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
My name is Colleen.

495
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
That sounds like a real pod show employee.

496
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
I'm here with the drinks.

497
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,440
And I don't have a podcast either, in fact, I listen to the radio.

498
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,440
What are you doing?

499
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
So what do you do it?

500
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Oh, my goodness.

501
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Colleen.

502
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
Dude.

503
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
We got to work on the last.

504
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
What are you doing?

505
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm in the pod show.

506
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
What are you doing?

507
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Pardon me?

508
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
What do you do at Pod Show?

509
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Uh, cause a lot of trouble.

510
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,440
And uh, do some software stuff.

511
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,440
I bring people together, really.

512
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I build cool shit.

513
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,440
It's like hand-holding between listeners, musicians, and...

514
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,440
You might know any cool shit that's in the pipeline from Pod Show.

515
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
That's what you listen to daily source code for.

516
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Really?

517
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
No.

518
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,440
You don't get any information from the daily source code.

519
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:26,440
I'll give him a break, poor guy.

520
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Okay, Colleen, little star.

521
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Michael Butler gets a little checkmark there.

522
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Okay.

523
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,440
I'm just keeping a tally here.

524
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
The meetups.

525
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Wonderful stuff.

526
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Let me see.

527
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
What should I do now?

528
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
What am I?

529
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Man, I've been doing it.

530
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
What are we now?

531
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Almost more than half an hour.

532
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Okay.

533
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,440
I want to talk about this wired article that greeted me this morning as I woke up.

534
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,440
First, I'll do a couple more promos.

535
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Get those out of the way.

536
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,440
The fourth annual Southern California Linux Expo is coming.

537
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,440
It will be February 11th and 12th 2006 at the Western Los Angeles Airport.

538
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Scale 4X will build on Scale 3X.

539
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,440
We've moved to a new location, which has allowed us to expand the Expo.

540
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,440
We'll have more speaker tracks and more tutorials designed to show users of all scale levels.

541
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,440
What open source can do, and Scale 4X will offer more boost space for those interested in showing how they've made open source work for them.

542
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,440
If you're interested in presenting on a topic, the Scale 4X call for papers open through November 20th 2005.

543
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,440
For those staying over, the Western is offering special hotel room rates for the Expo.

544
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Whatever your interest in open source, Scale 4X has something for you.

545
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Park fools!

546
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
What are your sources?

547
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
You don't have to do.

548
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
What?

549
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Are they drawing on these park lines?

550
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
Turn me a bit, Volio.

551
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Look upon by death.

552
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
I do what keep them.

553
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Hey there, Adam.

554
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
This is Sean J from Shakespeare Cast.

555
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Live from the streets of Verona, Italy.

556
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,440
Where it looks like the cavealts and monogues are getting a little hot and heavy again.

557
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about our new podcast at ShakespeareCast.com.

558
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,440
Or we're doing full cast recordings of Shakespeare's plays.

559
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Oh yeah.

560
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Calm down, everybody.

561
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Full cast recordings of Shakespeare plays one act at a time.

562
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,440
Well, right now it's more like one scene at a time, but we can't all start out as the pod

563
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Father now can we?

564
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,440
So head on over to ShakespeareCast.com and find out if Romeo and Juliet will make it this

565
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
time.

566
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Oh, who am I kidding?

567
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
It's a tragedy.

568
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Anyway, I love your show, but that sounds like the prince.

569
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,440
So I'd better get out of here before I get stabbed, poisoned, hung, or find out that the young

570
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,440
male page I find myself strangely attracted to is actually a shipwreck young woman.

571
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Oh, sorry.

572
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,440
Wrong play.

573
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Shakespeare cast.

574
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
Does that not hear?

575
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Pot show should only be enjoyed under the supervision of a podcasting professional.

576
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Warning.

577
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Do not attempt this at home.

578
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Alright, coming up, I'm going to take a look at this wired article that came out

579
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,440
some kind of riff between apparently I have a riff with the portable music expo.

580
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,440
We'll get into that for sure.

581
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,440
Oh, man, I played these roles before.

582
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,440
Wake it up the neighborhood.

583
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
Why are the women?

584
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Why are you drinking me to your door?

585
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Why don't we have an even there before?

586
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,440
How much drink it's got to do with my hair?

587
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Yes, needs a one-one, take care, take care.

588
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Can't smell the passion.

589
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,440
I don't know what I'm meant for.

590
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,440
No, I'm not meant for the child at all.

591
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,440
You got me feeling good.

592
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
Why are you not the neighborhood?

593
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Why don't we have an even there before?

594
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,440
How much drink it's got to do with my hair?

595

00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I've been on the name of the world

638
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I've been on the name of the world

639
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,440
I've been on the name of the world

640
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
I've been on the name of the world

I've been on the name of the world

I've been on the name of the world

647
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,440
I've been on the name of the world

648
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,920
Yeah, I know.

649
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,240
Yeah ah.

650
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,280
Yeah yeah

651
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,580
Yeah yeah

652
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,540
Why do you wanna be above

653
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,160
right in theuję

654
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,140
Wherever you want something

655
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,620
Yeah yeah

656
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,700
I ain't never brought it down

657
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,760
I ain't never brought it down

658
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,780
Why do you pick that one

659
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,480
Where you can make it

660
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,340
You ain't never brought it down

661
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,500
Who was that?

662
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,060
Take me to it

663
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,380
If we'd fooled your women

664
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,600
We accompagnoned our neighborhood

665
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:45,900
That's right

666
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:52,020
on the source code music.podshow.com is where you can find that. So I don't know if

667
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,020
you've seen this yet, I'm sure it'll show up in the show notes, which of course

668
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:02,700
you can find at dailysourcecode.com or curie.com. Oh man, huge controversy

669
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:09,900
brewing in the podcast world. You should read this article. It's so typical. So

670
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,700
it apparently wired is the reporting that I, that I, interestingly enough,

671
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,540
have an issue with the portable media expo. I'm not quite sure what happened

672
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:24,540
here in all the communication and, you know, geez, these guys, the podcast

673
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,820
brother started this idea over a year ago. I was, I've always been very

674
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,500
supportive of it and, and I've promoted and played bits from the show and I've

675
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,700
talked about it. I think maybe, you know, they said something on one of their

676
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,700
shows. I'm just going to paraphrase here. Oh no, I'm sorry, it started, it did

677
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,420
start with me. I said, I, I didn't think that the portable media expo was the

678
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,820
right venue for us to, you know, to get up on stage and talk about what we're

679
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,540
doing. And I think there, quote, was, look, where the Detroit auto show and

680
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,460
pod show was for that's weird that they're not there or something to that

681
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,220
effect. And so somehow it kind of got out of hand. I think Aaron, the pod

682
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,340
pin, who does marketing communications for us at pod show. Maybe you got a

683
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,700
little bit excited, you know, and when he heard that and, you know, Aaron's a good

684
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,700
guy gets, he's passionate about it gets worked up. And of course, what happens

685
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,500
then is the press loves a good controversy. Well, let me just tell you, the

686
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:26,300
expo is a fantastic idea and I supported 100%. I just want you to know, my

687
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,020
actually our approach, my partner and co-founder of pod show Ron Bloom, we've

688
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:36,620
been in business for like 12 years together. We've had many businesses. The

689
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,580
last one we did together. We took public. We had 700 people. You know, it was

690
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:46,340
huge operation. But never, ever, ever have we paid to play, I guess is is

691
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,300
what you could call it. Because here's here's how trade shows work. Basically

692
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,140
you sponsor the show. And then you get to put a speaker up on stage to do

693
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,140
often the keynote is offered or some other spot. And then you can basically do

694
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,620
your commercial. You do your ad about whatever product you're you're promoting.

695
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,700
This is exactly what Audible does. And by the way, a company like Audible,

696
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,300
this is how they operate. And this is the way they understand doing PR. Audible

697
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,300
has not been the force in pod casting at all. And now they're a platinum

698
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,060
sponsor. And, you know, they they paid. And so they're going to have a

699
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,340
speaking slot. I'm not quite sure if Don Katz is coming or someone else

700
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:28,940
representing the company. And they'll be rolling out a pod casting service

701
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,860
that that I know about, but I'm not glad to tell you about, which so I won't

702
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,380
know, damn announcements. So, but that's kind of the way it works, you know,

703
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,660
and we've never felt a need to do that. And, you know, when you're looking at

704
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,780
and it costs a lot of money to do this, you know, it's anywhere from 25 to 35,000

705
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,260
dollars. Well, first of all, we have nothing to announce, per se. I think there's

706
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,780
going to be a lot of announcements at this show. So, I'm much more of, hey,

707
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,740
let me just hang back and see what everyone else is doing and announcing. And,

708
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:00,620
you know, we've we want to be wise with how we invest our funds. And we

709
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:06,060
typically invest them in podcasters, which is the root of all of this.

710
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,980
You know, we're trying to help people do this full time. We're, um,

711
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:15,980
we're investing in the, um, in the podsafe music hold-down, uh, Thursday night.

712
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,220
You know, there's, uh, there's a couple of grand in that, uh,

713
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,980
to, you know, get people out and put people up and, uh, and get the venues

714
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:28,220
squared away, um, you know, so it's, um, it's, uh, that's what I like so much about,

715
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,500
actually Dave Wein are really solidified this for me a couple of years ago when he started

716
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:37,340
doing blogger con, which is the unconference. You know, it's, um, you, you go to a university

717
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,980
in this case, which is a, you know, pretty much a free venue. And, and I've always sponsored

718
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,820
blogger con. You know, I'll be the first to put down, you know, as much as Google did,

719
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,180
you know, I think we both put down a thousand dollars. I love that. I mean, that's the way it is.

720
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:56,460
There's no advertising. Um, it's, it's just free form communications. And, uh, to be honest,

721
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:02,380
um, uh, I think this is probably surrounds whether I should have done a keynote or not. I have nothing to say.

722
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,220
I mean, I got plenty to say, but that's what I love saying on the daily source code.

723
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:12,940
Little secret that not many of you know, I really, really, really do not like speaking in front of

724
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:18,380
audience just strange as it sounds. I love the little protection of my windscreen and my microphone.

725
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,380
I'm not big on doing that. It's like that Johnson Johnson thing I mentioned earlier, man,

726
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,300
they got a drag me to that because I mean, once I'm actually into the groove of it,

727
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,020
and I kind of treated like a show, then I'm, yeah, then I'm vibing on it. But, um, oh, no, because

728
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:36,540
I'm, I'm not funny. I'm not particularly quick on my feet. Um, I like to have things prepared.

729
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,340
And, yeah, it's just, it's, uh, it's different than announcing a Michael Jackson video, you know,

730
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:46,620
it's just much harder. So, um, so, and then what am I going to say? Hey, everybody, here's the

731
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:53,260
pod father. Thanks for coming. Come on, man. That's not for me. Um, and we actually, um, put together

732
00:46:53,260 --> 00:47:00,060
quite a, uh, quite a little schedule of, uh, flying, um, different pod show podcasters in, uh,

733
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:05,020
getting, uh, making sure that we can meet with everybody who wants to hook up, um, trying to

734
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:10,300
bring some good cheer. You know, and then I got a little messy where, you know, we wanted press credentials

735
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:15,260
for Steve Gilmore and Madge Weinstein and Madge Weinstein was refused to press good to credentials.

736
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,540
So, that kind of got to, what's that, huh? Uh, yes, thank you. Yes, that's mine.

737
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,860
You're too late. You can't be on the show. Now, only have a couple minutes left.

738
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:31,820
Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you see the red light revolving in front of the door, which means you can come

739
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:39,020
on in and that means you can come in. Red light spells danger. Thanks, baby. Okay, let love you.

740
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,300
Love you, too.

741
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:52,300
So, um, right, right. So, you know, that's the trade shows to me, you know, sponsoring that

742
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,100
is sponsoring the trade show business, which is great. And, uh, and I hope that the, uh,

743
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,980
the podcast brothers are very successful. I hope this is a recurring event. I think it's fantastic.

744
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:07,580
You know, it could easily be as, as big as any other, um, expo or trade show, uh, but

745
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:12,700
you have just never, we've never, you know, spent any money on that. You know, it, it comes from,

746
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,180
from the roots itself. And that's what we want to put our money is in, uh, in podcasters who,

747
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,860
um, strive to quit their, their day job. I think that there's a lot of people who would love to do that.

748
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:28,460
All right. So, I want to help you do that. Um, and you'll be hearing a lot, uh, um, certainly if we,

749
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,420
if we have an opportunity to hook up or if you see any of the other pod squatters, then, um,

750
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,460
they'll be telling you about the audition and, uh, all the good stuff that is, uh, that is to come.

751
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:44,380
So, no bad blood, my brothers. Not at all. Not at all. And that's it. Um, I'm going to start

752
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,900
packing. I have that whole list to, to, to work off all that stuff I got to do. I appreciate the time

753
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,820
you took, uh, this morning and I will talk to you either tomorrow or Friday. Bye bye.
