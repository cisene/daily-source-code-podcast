1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
throughout the course of this morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In connection with this tool.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I don't have any information at this time.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, everybody.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How are you doing?

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is the Daily Source Code.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, a second.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We turn that down for a second.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Daily Source Code episode 2-0-4.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today is July 7th, 2005,

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the this morning around 9.30 between 9.30 and 10 o'clock.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Everything that was a receiver in our home,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
here in the UK in Kilford,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
turned into kind of the crisis information flow.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
As we now know, and it is 3 or 330, almost 3.40.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Is that 33 people have been killed in the London bombings,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
hundreds wounded, some severely,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
all kinds of horrible things.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
These were obviously terraced attacks,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and although Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we don't really have any details yet.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So it didn't feel like this would be the day to do a normal up in

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
how happy are we source code?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me just listen in for a second,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
because they're just doing a press conference,

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and they're talking about,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
well, each department is talking about the days events,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and it's only turning it on for a second.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's most personal for a man, as well as the rest of the

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
multiple police service,

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and at the time he's much more banningly,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
he's been investigating these incidents,

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we're not prepared to discuss how many...

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay, it sounds like...

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sounds like they're just trying to get everyone out of the city,

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
they've asked everyone to leave in an orderly fashion,

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
so it's not to create a tremendous,

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you know, blockage of all roads out of London,

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
but they are asking everyone to go home.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Everything's been canceled.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The city is effectively shut down.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There's no subway services,

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
buses are being checked continuously,

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and there's not a lot of detail information.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank all of you for sending me email and text messages,

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
asking if everything's okay, all three of us are fine,

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and we were at home in Guilford,

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
which is 25 minutes outside of London,

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but already tonight at the church here,

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
there will be a vigil, I guess.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And as more news comes through,

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll be sure to related either on my weblog at www.curry.com,

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
or if it makes any sense, then I'll do that on a podcast.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I want to leave you with some wise words from Stevie Wonder.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello!

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Good morning, friend!

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Here's your friend,

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
neonounter.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I have serious news to pass on to you.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who will be my name?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, I'm about to say

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Couldn't mean the world disaster

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Could change your joy and laughter

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
To tears and may

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is that thought

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And he

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Come love today

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't delay

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We can live long

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Stop

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Beat me

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Before it's gone too long

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The force of evil plan

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
To make you inspire the nation

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And it will if we let it destroy

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Every time

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We all stay

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If love and peace you

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Treacher

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then you'll hear me

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When I say

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Whoa

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000

No

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000

Something across love

In me

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000

It's right to break my thoughts

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You got a strategy

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
