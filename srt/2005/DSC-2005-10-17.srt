00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-6-1

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I showed that car make no claims regarding the quality of its potchillers or the sanity of its producers.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Listen at your own risk.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There are no secrets.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Only information you don't have.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Adam Curry

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And it is Monday, October 17, 2005.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good morning everybody.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh yeah.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is about the earliest source code we've ever done.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For the first time I've seen the sunrise and northern California.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've got to tell you people it is beautiful.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good morning.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Welcome to the daily source code episode 261 coming to you from the Curry condo

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
in San Francisco, California.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Little bit too early for the cup of chinos.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've got a nice cup of tea here.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And of course all kinds of crap going wrong with the studio here.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't know what I think I blew up some kind of input on the Yamaha.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It'll be 16 gulf.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So if it sounds a little bit funky then you'll know that it's just a little bit of buggies that have to be worked out after international travel.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Of course I'm still on the power book with the external drive running two external firewire drives today.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
One for the playback from Megaseg and one for the recording with audio hijack pros or hopefully no skipping.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What a difference just a couple of weeks makes man coming back into the condo.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I rolled up the windows yesterday I arrived Sunday afternoon and oh my goodness.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I could see the marina.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Because the back of America building is completely gone.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Of course on the other side of my 180 degree view.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The enormous cranes that were rebuilding some other apartment are also gone.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So I've got a clear view.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can see a lot of miles and miles.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As I said it is 10 after 7 a.m. getting it all cranking up to bring you a wonderful week of data source code.

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's a Monday morning record of what Power Walk, right in the middle,

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
ARD of course, we're bringing that to us.

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A lot of audio feedback today.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
A lot of different things we're going to be talking about of course some pod safe

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Music lined up.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I still have the shitty connectivity here at the condo.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,600
You can hear by the way I got the windows open. I'm kind of airing the place out. It's been closed shut for two new almost three weeks

142
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,620
It actually didn't smell bad when I when I came in, but you know, I had a little bit of that kind of

143
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,320
recycled air feel to it if you know what I mean

144
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,160
So one of the things that has become very difficult actually, let me see if I can do that is

145
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
To read audio feedback

146
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,480
Because it's all on the Gmail and I have like almost no connectivity. Let me see if I can

147
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,360
If I can get to oh, actually, it's I've got like if you know if you have a power book you have that little

148
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,360
Kind of that little antenna indicator your signal strength indicator right in the top of your of your menu bar

149
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
So I've got just a little dot

150
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,560
And so when I hit Gmail, it says waiting for mail dot Google dot com, but I can't really do anything

151
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Okay, so I'm just let me get rid of that. I will have to wing it then one thing I do know 100% for sure is

152
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,600
I got an email from Christina for my daughter

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
It was really funny. She says, hey, can't you help a brother out

154
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,040
Apparently my chemical romance is playing at bricks in academies somewhere around the

155
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:11,160
The week of the 6th of November bricks in the Academy of course being in in the hood and in South East London more or less

156
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
And I'd like to go to actually

157
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,760
But of course, everything is completely sold out. So here's our typical plea. Does anyone know if they if there's a way that we can get hooked up

158
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,120
Because you know my daughter said can't you help a brother out

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,080
She's getting very close by the way to wanting to do her own podcast. I can I can I can feel it

160
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,880
She's saying she keeps saying like I want to do my podcast, but I have nothing to say

161
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,200
So well, how about all those songs you were playing? How about all that emo stuff all that independent stuff you found?

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,920
Oh, yeah, what I could talk about that. So I'm hoping that by the time I get back

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,600
She'll be wanting to do her first god save what no pod save the queen was the title of her podcast very cool

164
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
So I'm gonna be here for the next

165
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,280
I'd say 10 12 days kind of depending on what happens. Maybe 14

166
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,600
Tough to leave dude. I'll tell you had my sister over

167
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,160
She arrived. Let's see. I came back

168
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,600
Thursday from the Netherlands from my business trip and of course, you know that because we talked about that on Friday

169
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,720
And my sister was there with the friend of hers

170
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,800
We had a great time. We actually we didn't get around to doing anything on the podcast

171
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,040
We were just having fun, you know we were we went out to dinner and we hung out and we talked and we laughed and

172
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,640
It's the first time in a long time that the my sister has come over and hung out with me my other sister willow is an Italy

173
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,520
And as two kids there. So it's not quite as easy for her to

174
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,240
Just jump on over, but now was it was it was really good fun

175
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
So of course what that also meant is that

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,080
You know by the time was it was time for me to leave

177
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,640
I left the house month Sunday morning at 830

178
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,080
You know Patricia and I and Christina we kind of had the feeling that we hadn't really had our bonding time

179
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,200
And it's true, you know how you leave and you and you just haven't had you know you haven't had that

180
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Maybe it's that one evening together or whatever it is and and you just feel like

181
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,120
a little unsatisfied perhaps but

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Patricia's rough man. She's she's got the another head cold

183
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Which really fucking bites because what she has to have is she has to get one of those

184
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,640
Flu shots you know all of Europe is now talking about the the avian flu not the avian flu

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,240
Which is basically bird flu now we had this

186
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,120
Who will let me think when we had the castle the bird flu was was rampant throughout

187
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Western Europe and we

188
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,080
Actually the the quarantine area came within half a mile of

189
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,960
Of the of the castle which meant we might have actually had to

190
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:58,520
Call as they say or kill as I would say our swans and our ducks and luckily it passed just

191
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Just kind of before hitting us

192
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,000
But now they're talking about this avian flu and of course can be passed on from you know bird to bird but

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Can also be passed on from bird to human and

194
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,400
Although they have no

195
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:18,120
Scientific proof that can be passed from human to human just getting it as human as bad enough because it's really like a bad bad bad bad

196
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,880
Flu and can last up to I guess up to 14 days now. This is really dangerous for older people or people who have other

197
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,320
Other health issues and of course Patricia has

198
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,400
You know has there a heart medication on that crap and it's really not good because coughing strains everything

199
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,440
So oh by the way got some great fucking news check this out

200
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
When I went flying with the wind commander

201
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,480
Edicford tenta Patricia's cardiologist of course I he became Patricia's cardiologist when we found out she had a

202
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:57,240
Problem and I went for the best guy. I could find and of course all the the top lawyers and and top physicians

203
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,160
They all fly

204
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,280
So we got him to help out and and boy that was fantastic and you know, so of course

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,400
He hadn't seen Patricia for a while. He has new cardiologists, but this guy's like the top of this field

206
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,040
and

207
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,000
It was a great hospital in Belgium which is in Alsta. They are the one of the top facilities in Western Europe for

208
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,960
For a cardiology related illnesses and treatment and he said

209
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,680
You know she really should have another

210
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Another test done and this by the way is not really a fun test. It's a test where they basically shoot die into your heart valves

211
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,080
So they can see how your valves are functioning. He said you know with the cholesterol

212
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,400
Medication she's been taking and the beta blockers and all that other crap. He said it's very possible now

213
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,560
with some new technologies that have been developed that she could actually

214
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
have a a stand put into that one

215
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,560
bilateral artery that it that it closed up a bit and then she could actually you know

216
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,760
Probably stop taking most of the medication and that was a major major highlight of the trip

217
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,160
Excuse me just wait too early. So

218
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,040
I think we're gonna plan doing that

219
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,560
Because if they if they go in there to do the test and I see that the that the artery and this thing

220
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,360
It's just one small artery just a very minor one. It's one millimeter thick, but it was blocked for 90% so almost impossible

221
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
to put a stand in you know that's basically in

222
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,960
Angeo Plasti if you will you know little balloon ballooning there

223
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:44,280
If they find out that it's that it's you know less than that 10% open then they can probably put a stand in right there and that would solve just a

224
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,800
Shitload of problems but she was very very excited about that. I forgot to tell you guys that

225
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,240
Okay, enough of me crap in here

226
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,360
Looks like the setup is hanging in there. No skipping so far

227
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,560
I've had a back and forth email with podcasts Paul

228
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,400
Of course Paul is a lawyer in the United Kingdom and and a very active podcaster and

229
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
There's this new

230
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,560
Well, I thought it was a law. I got some feedback on it about

231
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,120
Music licensing and music rights that it's supposed to be rolled out across Europe now, you know the concept of Europe is

232
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
It's kind of funky these days as you know that

233
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,080
The French and the Dutch turned down the referendum for the for the constitution or voted no

234
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Which really really stunted the growth of of the of the EU

235
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,720
But Paul of course is the guy who can always tell you

236
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:41,800
You know what's going on he has always legal inroads and so I asked them give me some feedback on what these new music licensing issues are in

237
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,080
In Europe and

238
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,880
Of course I asked them to do it in audio for me. Come on in, Paul

239
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,200
Hi, Adam it's Paul Nichols from podcast Paul.com and podloid.com

240
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,880
My take at them on the European-wide music license that I've read so much about

241
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,840
I'm afraid Adam whenever the word Europe is mentioned

242
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,880
I think you know this you know there's going to be trouble and there's going to be a load of old nonsense that follows

243
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,280
Europe is made up of 25

244
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,640
Disparate nations there are 25 different member states all of which have different laws

245
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,880
What we've got to remember as well Adam is the fact that laws don't necessarily cut it with the music industry

246
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,080
There are organizations that have their own conventions

247
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,520
Their own trade practices and such like and that when you terms up by 25 there's an nonsense

248
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,200
Now what you could have done is to bring out something called a regulation

249
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,840
That's the most important derived source of community law this becomes directly applicable in every nation

250
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,360
So if Europe says right this is a regulation everybody would have to follow it

251
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,720
They haven't done that

252
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,720
What they could do then is to bring out a directive which isn't quite as good

253
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,320
But they simply say to each member state look we want you to do this we want music licensing sorted

254
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,480
We want the usage sorted out within a year and here's a directive and then it's binding and then each member states sorts that out through

255
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,840
Their own national laws

256
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,400
They've not done that either what they've done on the Friday's to give simply something called a

257
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,920
Recommendation

258
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,080
It does exactly what it says on the tin unfortunately a recommendation is just that

259
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,040
What they've said to each member state is look boys we can see there's a problem well we could have told them that couldn't we a year ago

260
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,920
And we'd like you to sort it out please what's the result if they don't nothing

261
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Some of the fried were bets of the drawing board

262
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,920
It is a step in the right direction because they realize that there are problems

263
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,440
Brom of fried if the music industry doesn't really take notice then I'm afraid nothing further happens. Yeah, that's my

264
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,360
Shit what is going on? It sounds like it's cutting off

265
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,400
Like it's cutting off the the end of stuff here. Yeah, man. I got to go through this whole setup

266
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,360
You know, this is all legacy issues from from my power book crash

267
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Here's the here's the plan by the way on that

268
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm hoping that around Wednesday or Thursday new power books will be announced and the meantime

269
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,920
I'm gonna get a one of those new find gold, you know the kind that I got bombed on new find gold the iMac G5s

270
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,480
Kind of get one here for for the condo and I was thinking of getting

271
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,000
Some kind of video converter so I can watch TV on that as well. I think there's a 20 inch right

272
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,960
So I'll just put the 20 inch up here and I'll use that for televisions

273
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:34,200
Well, I really like the idea of that remote control and kind of the media player that that goes along with that

274
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
I think that was actually

275
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,880
Excuse me. Do I have to tell you oh? Oh, yeah

276
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,640
Interesting how Sanseo is pronounced differently in so many different countries in the Netherlands where this thing comes from they say Sanseo

277
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
I've heard into UK Sancio

278
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Sancio

279
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,000
San Amelia oh, maybe that's why I like it

280
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,560
Anyway, so I'm still running my old power book off of firewire drive

281
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,600
I've got two hooked up now one for recording on two and the other one is where the music library lives

282
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,320
So they're not reading and writing to the same disc at the same time. That's to keep the the speeds kind of in check

283
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,880
Because I'm recording direct to the yeah to the hard drive with audio hijack pro

284
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,920
Um, so

285
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,880
You know one thing I'm definitely gonna gonna do is I'm going to can I think the speakers on the

286
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,960
On the iMac aren't all that great at least not the one that I have at home the new one may have a different speaker set up

287
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,720
But I've got that

288
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Logitech MM50 thing

289
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I told you about

290
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Actually, I got it right here. Hold on

291
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
This

292
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,040
Let me turn around so I can look at it. This is what I've been using for sound here in the condo and this thing is unbelievable

293
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,040
It's um, it's about the length of a loaf of bread, but it's much much thinner and it has

294
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,280
I think as four speakers in it's beautiful white it goes along with my iPod and

295
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,200
It has a slot right in the front kind of like a top front loader and you stick your iPod in there

296
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,360
It'll take um, it takes my iPod. I have I guess a third generation 30 gig

297
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,840
can take a mini and I presume a nano. I don't know if it can take the nano. I think it does

298
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,760
And it has a lithium ion battery on board. So what happens is when you plug this thing in

299
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,480
It gets power and it actually charges itself because it is portable

300
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,040
You don't need to run it on the AC adapter. It also charges up your your iPod

301
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,560
You can connect your iPod to your power books so you can synchronize and all that

302
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,160
But the sound that comes out of this thing is just so unfricing, believable

303
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,480
I mean I had this thing going and it sounds it's hard to explain

304
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,840
You know how you can walk into a room and then and you it's almost like the dynamics of the room or just

305
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,800
flowing with the

306
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,880
With the air coming out of the the speakers that's what it feels like it's really crisp and the low end is

307
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
unbelievable for such a little box

308
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,560
And I think I'm going to because it also has an external

309
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,400
An external plug so you can I I've been plugging it into my into my power book

310
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,880
You know I've been alternating back and forth because of course this iPod is not synced up to this power book yet

311
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,520
So I don't want to lose all of the songs that I brought with me

312
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,480
So you know I've been alternating back and forth if I got a little bit of connection that I'll play it off the power book

313
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,720
No connection then I yeah then I use the the iPod. It's the Logitech MM50 in case you hadn't noticed

314
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,280
They're sponsoring this show so we'll talk about that once in a while today was

315
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,280
Was obviously an important one because this is saving my life and it has some kind of

316
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,040
Built in surround sound system

317
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Which I kind of like

318
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,240
On particularly on older tracks you know you click that on you can do it all from a remote control

319
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,200
And it gives a little bit more of an expanded stereo stereo sound

320
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,200
I was gonna say something else about it. I can't remember I like it. It's it's that you know if it was shit

321
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,080
I wouldn't tell it. I would tell you it was shit. I wouldn't talk about it

322
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,720
But it's really it's a pretty cool device. Oh, and now. Oh, man. Let me get my camera. Oh

323
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,000
Just cracked and it's coming through the window. Oh, you're gonna love this. Wait. Let me get a picture here. Oh shit

324
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
I got it

325
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Let me see what I want

326
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,440
Pretty shot now. I just give me a freaking one of my supposed to take here. We go

327
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,600
Oh, this is beautiful. Okay. We got my cup of tea there

328
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,400
Oh shoot the flash wasn't supposed to go off home. Let me just flash off there. You go now you can really see as the sun

329
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,160
Oh, that's pretty my cup of tea in the foreground. Let me do it one more time

330
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,440
Okay, I'll post that one up on the show notes. You can look take a look at the yeah

331
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
At the MM50

332
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:59,400
That is beautiful with the sunlight just kind of a yellow glow wasping right over it. Oh, yes, we go the extra mile

333
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Rob Coslo member him

334
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,560
Rob Coslo one of the first pod safe music artist certainly from the instrumental realm to really break through in a big way

335
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,280
He is doing something very interesting. He's been talking to me about it over email for the past couple of

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I guess about a week and a half or two weeks

337
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,440
He's auctioning off a piano for a good cause of course I could tell you about it

338
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,240
But one of my but Robin CC Chapman take the honors

339
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Hey everybody this is Rob Coslo and I'm selling one of my pianos on eBay

340
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,680
I'm gonna let CC Chapman here tell you more about it

341
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,240
Hey everyone it's CC Chapman from accident hash dot com and you turn cafe dot com

342
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,640
How's it going? Rob asked me to take a couple minutes and just explain to you about this really cool piano

343
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,840
He's selling now as you know Rob is an extremely popular artist

344
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,240
He's one of the most popular pod safe artists out there. He's signed record deals his music is everywhere

345
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,160
So this is a really cool collectible if you're a fan of the music or if you're just a fan of playing the piano

346
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,760
It's a brand new piano. It's five months old and it's in mint condition

347
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,240
It's a Yamaha P22 professional upright piano 45 inches in height

348
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,480
It's a nice black matte finish and comes with a bench

349
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,920
Now what's cool is this isn't just a regular piano this is something that Rob actually used

350
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,160
He bought it and used it as his practice piano and he's created several of his songs on this

351
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,680
So if you're a fan it's a really kind of a cool thing to have in your house

352
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,400
Say you know so when Rob costs those all over the place in touring worldwide and it's a huge thing

353
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,960
You can say I've got this from when he first started out and he'll also autographed piano

354
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,600
Which is really cool and if you win the auction it's totally up to you how big he signs it and where he signs it

355
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,480
No, personally I think you need to get it just this huge autograph right across the front of Rob

356
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,800
Costillar that's what I would do if I want it

357
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,400
But it's up to you if you win the auction which is really really cool and if the piano does decent

358
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,720
Which I think is cool is Rob's not only gonna pocket some of the money. He's gonna donate a huge chunk of it to some very good charities

359
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,280
You know things like hurricane Katrina and the Susie beat Coleman, you know breast cancer

360
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Charities which is great and cool for Rob to do it because this is eBay and it's such a big item

361
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,560
US bidders are preferred but if the bid's go high enough

362
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,840
They will ship the other places in the world and the shipping will be different you know obviously

363
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,760
This is a piano it's a big shipping item

364
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,200
But the UK and her Europe shouldn't be a problem so swing on by and check it out anyways

365
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,240
So how do you gonna do is go to ebay.com and search for Rob Costillar that's ROB

366
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,560
COST

367
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,720
L-O-W and check it out or you got the Rob Costillar.com. I'll have a link out there

368
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,920
I know I also put a link up on my site so check it out. This is a really cool way to get a part of

369
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,160
podcasting in music history and I think that's really really cool and

370
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,280
Hopefully somebody will win it. I'm keep my eye on the auction because I want to see who wins it and Rob's gonna put you know

371
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,840
Your picture your link anything you want up on the site as well when you win the stuff so I think it's great

372
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,080
So seriously simply going on by ebay.com and put it in Rob Costillar and buy a piece of history

373
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Whatever happened

374
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
To fail

375
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Michael and Evo's winning it

376
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,920
5 4 3 2 1

377
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Good to job curry

378
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,800
Yeah, that's out of the pod. We come growing. This is the dragon page winging it

379
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
The kick ass mystic ninjas

380
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,720
Hello everybody this is a joke most important. Oh Mike wants to open up a beer. It's got a little urine flavored

381
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,800
Michael, how do you recognize a flavor of your

382
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,600
We're lonely. We're so lonely

383
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:32,360
Yeah, they couldn't have showed up at a worst possible time

384
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,520
It's irresponsible. It's irreversible. It's irreversible

385
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,160
The dragon page what some guys do instead of dating

386
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,840
I have so much dick you wouldn't believe it massive amounts of dick. I'm going on a dickathon.

387
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Uh-oh, really?

388
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Holy cow

389
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Oh

390
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:07,240
My word okay time for an Evo cult update Lynn wants to know Michael when you get your cult

391
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,200
Oh, you made a lot of people very happy

392
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,520
Right, yeah, you can stop it right there at that time. I'm just preparing to go like rub people's bodies for that

393
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,240
You have no idea our arms are so tired from our own stroke stop

394
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
Not touching that

395
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Not touching that at all

396
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
I do not laugh like Scooby-Doo

397
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,200
Music now on daily source code episode 261 as I stand here my White House code and my black oak boots

398
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:08,120
Wanting to play this one for a couple of days actually funny got some time love spirals and walk away

399
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:32,680
All bats just want to take it on me

400
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,440
記

401
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Close to the Fire

402
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Really burn our hands

403
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,600
I won't believe it at heart

404
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,600
So then drop it to the sins

405
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I won't go away

406
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,600

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,600
So now you're on my way

412
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,600
And now you're on my way

413
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Take a chance anymore

414
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,600
No, I'll go away

415
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm on my way

416
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,600

So now you're on my way

420
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,600
I won't go away

421
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,600
So now you're on my way

422
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,600
So now you're on my way

423
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:45,600
This is one of the minor drawbacks of podcasting

424
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,600
You know when you get to choose the music and get to take care of everything yourself

425
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Which is just beautiful

426
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
People who have worked in radio

427
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
No one I'm talking about it so nice

428
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Not to get handed a list by a producer or a computer

429
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Is that used play stuff that kind of fits the mood that you're in at the time you're doing the show

430
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,600
And it may not always be the exact same mood for you

431
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
If we're raining I might play some different songs

432
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
And it may not be raining when you are

433
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
So that's kind of a disconnect

434
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
But yet in a strange way a great connect

435
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Because you kind of know what the vibe is

436
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,600
And I actually I brought my eyesight along with me

437
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I'm contemplated recording recording video

438
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I guess what I could do is I could record the entire show

439
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Excuse me

440
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,600
In quick time if you have quick time I guess you have to have quick time seven

441
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
And you have to have the pro version but then you can just record a new video clip

442
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,600
And records an MPEG video which is of course exactly right and formatted for the iPod

443
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,600
And it might be funny to do that

444
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,600
I'm particularly funny to see what I do during the songs

445
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
I'm doing all kinds of stuff

446
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,600
So when I get a new power book or maybe if I get the iMac or something has a hard drive built in

447
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
I'll look into doing that

448
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
That's what I guess that's what Mary and Carla are doing

449
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
That Mary and Carla show man I told you about that right

450
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,600
So first they had those two guys they were podcast off

451
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
They were potting off against them

452
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,600
They're potting off back and forth with the tipsy girls tipsy chicks

453
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
You got to check that show out tipsy chicks

454
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
I think it's tipsy chicks dot com they're an iTunes

455
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
And it's kind of

456
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,600
It's funny because I think they're all they're all really smart and they're all very creative and talented

457
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,600
But now it's kind of like okay the tipsy chicks think that Mary and Carla

458
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Okay, they're

459
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
They think that they're kind of dipsy

460
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Oh man I've got to play the you know they they responded to me playing the promo and they shook their ass on the show for me

461
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,600
I got to play that for you. I'll make sure I do that for tomorrow's source code

462
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Okay, we are at seven forty now and the minute I'm done with this show as it's uploading

463
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,600
I'm gonna hop on over to the office haven't seen the folks who will I've seen him on on video chat obviously on iChat

464
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,600
I'm excited to see everybody again and they have a demo

465
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,600
I think today at 2 o'clock they're gonna show me some of the new stuff for podshow dot com very very excited about it

466
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,600

Antipodian anti-podian which I think is antipodian

478
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:13,600
If you're listening to this show on serious satellite channel 103 serious stars

This is the daily source code every day 603 Pacific followed by let's see what's today's lineup

481
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,600
I don't I can't find the podcast of that show. I thought I was going to put it up on

482
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Gilmore daily dot pot show dot com, but I haven't seen it there, so I'll now that I'm on the same time zone with them. I'll find out where they are because this is the show the new show is doing with the Mike Vizard

483
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
And it's like a half hour show a daily

484
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Tech attention show. It's I like it. I've heard just a couple of them, but I want to hear every single one

485
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,600
I also haven't seen my serious satellite receiver. I got to see if maybe that was dropped off downstairs

486
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Anyway, after a attention tech will have a DVD weekly with Don and Jared followed by CC Chapman's accident hash a full hour of the best in pod safe music

And we're still working. This is the week that we're actually meeting with a couple people regarding the unlabel concept and we're going to be talking to some folks about

489
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:35,600
About music licensing and boy, I've gotten so much feedback on this and I've been collecting everything and you know, it's stuff from like podcast Paul and and other lawyers people in the entertainment business

490
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,600
There's a lot of excitement about this and and as I've said many many times before we are recreating

491
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,600
The music business. There's no different than the changes we've seen in in history

492
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,600
When technological change came along with social change and new music forms were born and

493
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,600
You know, and industries had to more literally overnight in order to you know, or to even be able to keep up

494
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Hey, Kurt

495
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Digital slot pod the brand new podcast from universal press and get columnist Kurt Brando is already changing lives

496
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
I heard the first digital slot pod show and I woke up next day with a whole new view on life

497
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Plus my surprise this was gone. I mean completely gone

498
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,600
I could barely believe it, but digital slot pod made me too much as taller

499
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Finally, I could serve the web without my lifts

500
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,600
I took the digital slot quiz

501
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Then I called my dad and he took it too

502
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,600
We we had spoken in eight years

503
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Digital slot didn't just give me a good show. He gave me my life back

504
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:53,600
My friend told me to listen to the digital slot pod yesterday, and I said, are you kidding?

505
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,600
I don't even speak English, but hey you get me now

506
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:07,600
I know the digital slot called has an officially started yet, but I'm already telling people I'm at level seven

507
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Listeners of the digital slot pod come away filled with gratitude

508
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Thank you digital slot

509
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Thank you digital slot, and please send me some brochures that I can pass out at the airport

510
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Here, touch my head, G

511
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Go ahead

512
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Touch it

513
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Speccy by digital slot

514
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
I love you daddy

515
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I love you so much

516
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Listen to the digital slot, digital slot.com

517
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
A better version of your life awaits

518
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
You just haven't downloaded it yet

519
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Is something about Russian that kind of turns me on?

520
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
I don't know what it is

521
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,600
I noticed this when I was in in Russia

522
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,600
There's something about Russian girls speaking English that that's kind of cool

523
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I wouldn't mind a promo for the source

524
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,600
You know, I've realized that I have never made a promo for the daily source code

525
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
I think it's also because I'm afraid to

526
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,600
People will be expecting so much creativity in such great production values

527
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
I don't think I can live up to the expectations

528
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
I should do that

529
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Maybe I'll do that this week when I get the new, the new Max in

530
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Oh, yes podcast expert, that's one I would talk about

531
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
So I'm definitely going

532
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
The idea is I'm going to go back in like 12 days

533
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Go hang out with the girls for a full week

534
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,600
And then go straight to, I guess I'll fly to Los Angeles

535
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,600
And then we'll go, I think this place is, although it sounds like it's in Canada

536
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:42,600
It's not all that far from LA, maybe it's a reasonable drive from Los Angeles

537
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
So definitely going to go

538
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
And oh, by the way, please stop with all the offers for the helicopters and the

539
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Biaches that just way too many offers for that, okay?

540
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Stop it

541
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600

This is a Carmen Tyler, Carmen with a Y and Tyler with a Y

586
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Remember we played a couple of her songs

587
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Which turned out to be covers

588
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Well, she uploaded one of her own songs

589
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
This one I guess she wrote and composed that she's got

590
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,600
I think she has a team that she does this with

591
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
And this is just a demo she wanted me to say

592
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
But I definitely wanted to play it for you

593
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600

Hey guys

598
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,600

Playing close to me

602
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,600
It's gone

603
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,600
Now all I have in me

604
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Are all those memories

605
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,600

00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,600
My heart is still in twine

611
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,600
Oh yes, my love was blind

612
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,600

Close to me

618
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,600
We said our last goodbye

619
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,600
With tears in my eyes

620
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
No

621
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:53,600

00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,600
That's irritating

648
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Miss the end there

649
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Okay, I'll fix all that stuff

650
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,600
So what am I going to try to do for

651
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,600
For the weeks that I'm out here at the condo

652
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,600
I'm going to try and keep in the rhythm

653
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Now that I'm in the

654
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Kind of in the get up very early mode

655
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,600
I was up at 515 this morning

656
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,600
I had set the alarm for 630

657
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,600
I really didn't get going

658
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,600
So I started recording the shows as you know

659
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Around 10 past 7

660
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
I'm going to try and keep that up

661
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,600
So that we can have the show

662
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
Nice and early to you

663
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,600
That's the problem

664
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,600
And being on the west coast is your behind the times

665
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
You really are

666
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,600
Want to thank the sponsor for today's show

667
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,600
Logitech

668
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
On the show notes check out there

669
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,600
MM50

670
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
It's a great box

671
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
I use it

672
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,600
So there's an endorsement for you

673
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
And thank you Logitech for putting the upper

674
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,600
In the upper class

675
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
When I fly version of landing

676
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,600
Everybody have yourself a great week

677
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
Have yourself a great start of the week

678
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,600
This Monday

679
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
And we'll talk to each other tomorrow morning

680
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Right here from the Curry condo

681
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
So take care

682
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
And bye bye

683
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,600
Need to fill this thing up

684
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,600
Talk to you tomorrow
