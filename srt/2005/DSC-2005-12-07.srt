10
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,800
or came in and said, wow, I like this.

11
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,840
She does every single time I play a Grittles song.

12
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
It doesn't matter which one.

13
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,240
So I think she's got that, yeah, she's the radar is going off.

14
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,960
So I really need a town coordinator for my show now

15
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,720
because I've been trying all morning to persuade Patricia

16
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,520
to come on if she needs a five minute walk on here

17
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,880
on the show because I've got some audio feedback

18
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,720
from her for her from whispered pearls.

19
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,040
And as Grittles was playing, I yelled down

20
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,800
over the, over the banister.

21
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600
And I got a very curt reply.

22
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,760
Yeah, I hear you.

23
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay, she's on the phone with someone.

24
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hey, she doesn't care about the show, man.

25
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Ah, so many interesting things in the news

26
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,080
that talk about related to podcasting

27
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,760
and media in general.

28
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,800
Trevor Carpenter sent me an article

29
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,480
which he says isn't about the music business per se,

30
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,920
but more about European publishing.

31
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,120
And he said, you know, it does kind of have the same vibe

32
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,800
if the music guy's the same as the publishing guys

33
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,960
and I'll talk about music publishing,

34
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,160
but I would just say publishers are printed, et cetera.

35
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,200
You know, Europe could be in for quite an interesting ride.

36
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,040
This isn't article from the Associated Press.

37
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,680
European publishers warn Tuesday, they cannot keep,

38
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
listen to this very carefully.

39
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
They warn Tuesday, they cannot keep allowing internet search engines

40
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,680
such as Google to make money from their content.

41
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,600
Quote, the new models of Google and others

42
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,560
reverse the traditional permission-based copyright model

43
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
of content trading that we have built up

44
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,280
over the years, said Francisco Pinto Blas-Samal.

45
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,600
No, Blas-Samal, the head of the European Publishers Council

46
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
in prepared remarks for a speech at a Brussels conference.

47
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,360
So it was a written response, I guess.

48
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,320
It goes on to say, this is really fascinating.

49
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
So I'll read this next paragraph.

50
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,120
It's fascinating to see how these companies help themselves,

51
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,800
quote, to copyright protected material,

52
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,360
build up their own business models around what they've collected

53
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,520
and parasitically earn advertising revenue

54
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,240
off the back of other people's content.

55
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,560
This is unlikely to be sustainable for publishers

56
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
in the long term.

57
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Wow.

58
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,800
Wow.

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,800
So what they're saying is that a search engine going out

60
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,800
and indexing content, which, hey, if they index my weblog,

61
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,880
it's essentially, that's copyrighted information.

62
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,840
It's on to creative comments, but it's copyrighted.

63
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,560
So, but I don't have a problem with it, obviously,

64
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,920
for obvious reasons.

65
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,040
But they're saying that that's foul.

66
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,080
That's a foul that you can't do that.

67
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,160
That you can't build a business model around search.

68
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,960
This is so un-really incredibly amazing.

69
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,600
This is coming from Brussels, man, from the European Union.

70
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,480
This guy is, I'm sorry, not the Union.

71
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,240
He's the head of the European Publishers Council,

72
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,440
but he was talking in Brussels, which is where it all goes down.

73
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,120
Let me see if there's anything else in here.

74
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,480
Last March, Ajahn's false press claimed the Google

75
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,760
News Service infringed on their copyrights

76
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,040
by reproducing information from the websites

77
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,840
of subscribers of the Paris-based news wholesaler.

78
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,840
It is seeking at least $17.5 million, 14.85 million euro,

79
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,760
and damages.

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,480
AFP says Google is breaking rules

81
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,360
on the fair use of copyright material

82
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,360
because it's new site looks similar to AFP subscribers on that's horseshit.

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,640
So there's a real simple fix guys.

84
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,480
You can put it in a robots.txt file

85
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,000
and Google won't index you.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,440
Let's see if you like that as much.

87
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,960
If you don't want people discovering you,

88
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,880
like God would boneheads unbelievable.

89
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,560
Well, I don't think that's gonna hold up.

90
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Which judge is gonna be the one that says,

91
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,440
oh, Google, you can't index information

92
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,960
because it's breaking copyright.

93
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,480
Who wants to take on that fight?

94
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,400
I really want to thank everybody

95
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,240
for thinking with me about the tattoo.

96
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,760
Since Christina got a tattoo on her just above her butt crack,

97
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,600
I might add.

98
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,920
I've been thinking of a tattoo myself,

99
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
not above the butt crack,

100
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,440
but on my, I guess my right arm.

101
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,520
And I've been getting some pretty interesting designs

102
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,040
that see this call for, oh, there she is.

103
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,880
Hello.

104
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
Hello.

105
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,240
I was waiting for the doubt, he's not coming in.

106
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,280
Yeah, let me turn this out before you.

107
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,760
Where is it?

108
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,600
There you go.

109
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,440
All right.

110
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,080
Gee, I need a talent manager now.

111
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,920
Why?

112
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,400
Well, because I couldn't get the talent on the show.

113
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,640
No, I'm so busy.

114
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,480
People are phoning me, wanna talk to me.

115
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah, you're so popular.

116
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm so popular.

117
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,560
I play that song the one you liked.

118
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,400
Oh yeah?

119
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,240
Do you know who it was?

120
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,080
No.

121
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Groodle.

122
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
We have plenty of time.

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,920
Three songs.

124
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,760
Three times.

125
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Every time we like it.

126
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,760
But it's a, I've played three different songs.

127
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,840
Each time, when I play the song,

128
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,440
when I come in, you come in and you say,

129
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,160
hey, I like that.

130
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,080
Well, so doesn't that tell you something?

131
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
I have taste.

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,440
Ha ha ha.

134
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,280
Cool.

135
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,040
I can still, I recognize them.

136
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,320
Speaking of taste, I received a piece of feedback,

137
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,560
some fan mail from whispered pearls.

138
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,280
Oh, you know, the two girls who were talking about,

139
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,080
that's, by the way, is the non-family safe portion

140
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,760
of the daily source code for time.

141
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,680
And so they sent some feedback and have a question for you.

142
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,040
So are you ready?

143
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,880
Okay.

144
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,400
Here we go.

145
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,880
Hi, this is Michelle from whispered pearls.

146
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,320
Hi, Adam and Patricia.

147
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,160
Thank you for responding to our podcast.

148
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,200
It's much appreciated.

149
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,520
And you know, Adam, I've long suspected

150
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,280
that you have an amazing cook.

151
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,760
But let's just stop right there.

152
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

153
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,280
Well, wait a minute, why are you laughing?

155
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,960
Because I just know because it's true.

156
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,120
Yeah, you love this.

157
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
Yeah, exactly.

158
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,200
Man, love to hear this.

159
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Uh-huh.

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Yeah.

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
It will really make his day.

162
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,320
Christmas came early this year.

163
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

164
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Yeah.

165
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,360
You want to hear that again?

166
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,000
We're just going to tell you.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No, we heard it.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,520
Thank you Patricia for confirming that.

170
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
No confirming.

171
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
No confirming.

172
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I know.

173
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
That's what I said.

174
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Nasty.

175
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Indeed.

176
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Very lucky to be able to put that in your mouth.

177
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Oh my god.

178
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
You want to.

179
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
When Adam's not working.

180
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
When Adam's not working.

181
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
You're so lucky.

182
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
I'm not talking.

183
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
No, I just.

184
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Well, that's how we get you to stop talking.

185
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Yeah.

186
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
So I just wanted.

187
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
I just want to.

188
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
I just want you to know that other people think you're very,

189
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
very lucky.

190
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

191
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Oh, let me tell you later.

192
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
What does that mean?

193
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Okay.

194
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Let me.

195
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Let me be a threat.

196
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
All right.

197
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Here we go.

198
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,520
And, you know, I agree with you about the Patricia about the, um,

199
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
you know, strange men thing.

200
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,520
I did that a lot more in my youth than I'm doing now.

201
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,520
But she was talking about, um,

202
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,520
performing Felicia on strange men.

203
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Oh, yeah.

204
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Yeah.

205
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
I couldn't imagine that.

206
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Right.

207
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I just didn't do that as often anymore.

208
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Oh, thank God for that.

209
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Uh, you can't keep a girl from giving a blow to have it.

210
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,520
It's just something that I'd love to do.

211
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Ah.

212
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Do you love doing it, huh?

213
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
No, no, no, no, no.

215
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
I'm not doing it.

216
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Okay.

217
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Okay.

218
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
I just want to make sure that you didn't have any interim comments.

219
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,520
You know Patricia, if you have any advice.

220
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Uh, no.

221
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,520
How a large, breasted blow job.

222
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,120
giving loving woman can find a good man like Adam.

223
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,720
It would be very appreciated.

224
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Thanks.

225
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Bye.

226
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,320
I think she has all the qualifications.

227
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Sounds like he doesn't.

228
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know.

229
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,520
It's, you know, the thing is, if I hear them talk,

230
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,720
but you know, it's especially because it's nice

231
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
that people can talk about this.

232
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,920
And there are probably a lot of people want to hear this.

233
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,320
Power to the podcast, baby.

234
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,920
Exactly.

235
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,920
And they want to get that off their big chest.

236
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
Of course.

237
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,720
But I always hate to to talk about that a lot,

238
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,720
because it makes men even bigger assholes.

239
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
You know, that's what I think.

240
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,920
I think they already think they're all that in a bag of chips.

241
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,720
They think they're so special.

242
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,520
So my thing, I am nice.

243
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm always very warm.

244
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,120
I have a big smile.

245
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,720
I like to tease, but I'm totally in control.

246
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,320
And so my message is, don't, don't.

247
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,520
Yeah, I can explain that in detail.

248
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,720
Don't bring your guns.

249
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,320
Well, yeah, don't give them too much right away.

250
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Just let them work for it.

251
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
Let them chase you.

252
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
That is the thing.

253
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,120
Make it very special.

254
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,320
Because if they think they can get it, just like that,

255
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,720
man, you're in trouble.

256
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,120
Let the balance of power as a whole.

257
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Yeah, that's not good.

258
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,320
It's because men like women who are in control.

259
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,520
And they love to be controlled.

260
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
That is very sexual.

261
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,720
So I will never be the underdog.

262
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,120
I will never play the underdog.

263
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
You know that.

264
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Right?

265
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Well, what do you mean by underdog?

266
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Well, I'm not the one.

267
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
The submissive one.

268
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm the one in control.

269
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,520
I will say, Adam, lay down.

270
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Oh, this is what we're going to do.

271
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
No, it's like, would you like a cup of tea?

272
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,120
Would you like to have sex?

273
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Oh, oh, something happened to my sound.

274
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Did you just lose it?

275
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Yeah, I think so.

276
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,320
I was so lovely.

277
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Did you have no sound?

278
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Yeah.

279
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
No, nothing.

280
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Why would you do?

281
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
I don't know.

282
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
I didn't do anything.

283
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
What are you hearing?

284
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Subtash.

285
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Shit man.

286
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm back.

287
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
I'm back.

288
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
I'm back.

289
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
So yeah, that's what I like.

290
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
And my experience.

291
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,320
You know, I had very interesting men, very powerful men.

292
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
That's what they like.

293
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
So that's my experience.

294
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I will never, ever behave like that.

295
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
It works both ways, by the way.

296
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Because I didn't do anything for a long, long, long time when we met.

297
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
I made no moves.

298
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
No.

299
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
And then what happened?

300
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
I like that.

301
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Yeah.

302
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
And then what happened?

303
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Then what happened?

304
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
You made the move.

305
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Yeah.

306
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Yes.

307
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
But.

308
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Guys, let me tell you, there's nothing like keeping a woman going from months

309
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
and then learning to speak to a woman.

310
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
First, I said you a lot of beautiful food.

311
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Really?

312
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Yes.

313
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Oh, yeah.

314
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
A lot of avocados with shrimp.

315
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Very good.

316
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Very good.

317
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
And lots of salmon.

318
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
I remember lots of salmon.

319
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
But I didn't go on my sushi.

320
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Right away.

321
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
On your knees.

322
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
No.

323
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
No.

324
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
In fact, no.

325
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
So that's my thing.

326
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
I mean, you know.

327
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Okay.

328
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
No.

329
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
You can go shopping now.

330
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Yeah.

331
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
He's shopping.

332
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Yeah.

333
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
For your friend.

334
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Yeah.

335
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
That's true.

336
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Don't blow the surprise.

337
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Oh, okay.

338
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Okay, baby.

339
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Thank you.

340
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Well, that was, that was some very good advice.

341
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Yeah.

342
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Yes.

343
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Well, thank you so much.

344
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
Thank you so much.

345
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
I like them very much.

346
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Yeah.

347
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
They sound very good.

348
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Yeah.

349
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
I think it's a great show.

350
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I love listening to it.

351
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
I look forward to it.

352
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
They sound like they have big breasts.

353
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Isn't that crazy?

354
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Really?

355
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Yeah.

356
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
I haven't developed that personally.

357
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Both.

358
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
But one of them for sure.

359
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Okay.

360
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
And it's got nothing to do with being thin or, you know, heavier.

361
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
No.

362
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
No.

363
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
No.

364
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
No.

365
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
No.

366
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
That's right.

367
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
That's right.

368
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Okay.

369
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
That's right.

370
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
You're lovely for my brain, right?

371
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Absolutely.

372
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
You know, we put my penis as close to it as possible.

373
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
I see.

374
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Okay.

375
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Bye.

376
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Thanks, baby.

377
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
I love you.

378
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Love you too.

379
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Oh, they ain't no break the studio.

380
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
That's why.

381
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Uh-huh.

382
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Oh, by the way, huh, before you go, look.

383
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Some people sent me some tattoo ideas.

384
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Come on.

385
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
You got it.

386
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh, boy.

387
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Hold on.

388
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Let me see.

389
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Goal for.

390
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Um.

391
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Wait a minute.

392
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Shit.

393
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I think this is it.

394
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Hold on.

395
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Let's take a look.

396
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Oh, God.

397
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I have to re-log into Gmail.

398
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
I hate that.

399
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
Hold on.

400
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
See if it'll load it up immediately or if I have to do it again.

401
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Uh-huh.

402
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
No, it's going to the inbox.

403
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm afraid.

404
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Oh, God.

405
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Now the whole computer is.

406
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
You know what?

407
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
This happens every single way.

408
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
It might, it might fix it.

409
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
So whenever a picture comes near the computer.

410
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Yeah.

411
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Yeah.

412
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I said, wings.

413
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I want something cool in the middle.

414
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
I've got to open this.

415
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Hold on.

416
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Oh.

417
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Pain in the ass.

418
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Okay.

419
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
In the meantime, let me take.

420
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Let me show you the next one.

421
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
This is from Frank Frank Jonah.

422
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Yeah.

423
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
This is one.

424
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Oh, this is one.

425
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Wings with a little musical.

426
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Is that a clef?

427
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Is that what is that?

428
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
So.

429
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
The G.

430
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
G.

431
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Yeah.

432
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Look at this other one.

433
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
So everyone kind of got the wings thing.

434
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
They figured that out.

435
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
That's nice, isn't it?

436
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,320
This is with my head in the middle with an iPod attached to it.

437
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
Ah, thanks.

438
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
I don't think.

439
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
But this is nice, isn't it?

440
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
That's kind of cool with a little heart.

441
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,320
And it has, so it has a whole bunch of things in there.

442
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Uh, and then Andy Armstrong sent one.

443
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
In pod we trust.

444
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
No.

445
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Well, but it has PC and CC in there.

446
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
What?

447
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
What?

448
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
What?

449
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Come closer.

450
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Jump.

451
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,820
Jump to the mic, baby.

452
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
Jump up.

453
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
A little vagina with wings.

454
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Very nice.

455
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
Okay.

456
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
I think you've overstayed your welcome.

457
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
Hold on.

458
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
Let me open this mic.

459
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,820
What?

460
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Instead of that.

461
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
You know.

462
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Yeah.

463
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
It's kind of cool though, isn't it?

464
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
But I like this one.

465
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
I really like the other one.

466
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
What is this one?

467
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
It's nice.

468
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
It's nice.

469
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
It's nice.

470
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
It's nice.

471
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,820
It's nice.

472
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
That's pretty cool.

473
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Yeah.

474
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
You know, because of my father.

475
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
Because he's a great musician.

476
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Oh, yeah.

477
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,820
It had a whole bunch of stuff.

478
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,820
But it doesn't really show the, I wanted the freedom of media somewhere in there.

479
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
I don't think.

480
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
Yeah.

481
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
It doesn't quite show that, yeah.

482
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Is everything?

483
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
It has a heart.

484
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Yeah.

485
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,820
I'll talk in front of the mic, baby.

486
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Please.

487
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
No one can see it.

488
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Well, but you already saw it.

489
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
It has a heart.

490
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Yeah.

491
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
It has.

492
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
Well, let me try.

493
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Looky.

494
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
There you go.

495
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,820
Can you see it?

496
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,820
It has everything.

497
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,820
It's nice.

498
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
It's actually up with that on the weblog.

499
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Hmm.

500
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,820
On the end of the show.

501
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
No.

502
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
It's a look at it.

503
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
Yeah.

504
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
You're going to get a tattoo as well.

505
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
Huh?

506
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,820
You're going to get a tattoo?

507
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
No.

508
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
I don't know.

509
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
No.

510
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Why would you want that?

511
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,820
I don't know.

512
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Okay.

513
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
All right.

514
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I'm going on with the show.

515
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Thanks, baby.

516
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
All right.

517
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
Bye.

518
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Okay.

519
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
So keep in common.

520
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,820
And I'll shoot hold on the studios for an apartment here.

521
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
I'm trying it.

522
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
Ow.

523
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
Okay.

524
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
Got it.

525
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Twist the G5 back into place.

526
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
There we go.

527
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,820
That's better.

528
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
All right.

529
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
The lovely Patricia, everybody.

530
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Yosa.

531
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
Let's see.

532
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,820
What else did I have here?

533
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
Oh, I asked yesterday about

534
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,820
Lucien set up of Daily Planet TV.net.

535
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
And Frank again,

536
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,820
sent in this awesome link to Varus Software.

537
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,820
Actually, he sent a link to Wirecast.

538
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
And I think this is indeed exactly what Lucien is using.

539
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
It's very cool.

540
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
It's like a teleprompter,

541
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,820
but you can do effects and stuff at the same time.

542
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,820
It's very much a video podcast set.

543
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,820
So I think that I'll download that and I'll take it with me on the plain Saturday.

544
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,820
I'm going to San Francisco and play around with it and see what I come up with.

545
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
So that should be pretty cool.

546
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,820
All right.

547
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,820
More feedback here today.

548
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,820
Hi.

549
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
I'm this is Kevin and Beth from Dayton, Ohio.

550
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,820
We're here just to tell you about.

551
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,820
All right.

552
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,820
I'll admit it.

553
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
I'm one of the people who turned you into Apple.

554
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
We're having explicit content on your podcast.

555
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,820
But there's a big difference between explicit and offensive.

556
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
There's nothing offensive about

557
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
your show at all.

558
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
We both listen regularly.

559
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
What?

560
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,820
Eight ten months now?

561
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,820
Yeah.

562
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
We're dedicated listeners and Adam.

563
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
We don't give a shit.

564
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,820
What you say on there.

565
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
What you plan there.

566
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
It's all good.

567
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,820
Whatever the fuck you want.

568
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,820
But if we're going to go with what Apple's narrow definition of explicit is.

569
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Your podcast should be explicit.

570
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
And that's the point I tried to make the apple.

571
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Yeah.

572
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
It's Apple's problem.

573
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Not yours.

574
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,820
They seem to go with what the recording industry has gone with as an explicit.

575
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
You say shit.

576
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
You say fuck.

577
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
You say dam in a song.

578
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
That song's explicit.

579
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,820
And then they enforce it arbitrarily.

580
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Yeah.

581
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
This all started when a couple of weeks ago is listening to

582
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,820
Ignatian with Kevin Wright, Rose and Alex Albrecht.

583
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Great podcast.

584
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
They got the same email that you got from Apple saying,

585
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
You know, hey, you need to mark your content as explicit.

586
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,820
They were completely dumbfounded because they'd swear two, three times an episode.

587
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
No fun, Adam.

588
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
But you swear ten times as much as they do.

589
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
And I don't consider you're swearing excessive.

590
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,820
But given that narrow definition of if you swear in your podcast that you remarked as an explicit,

591
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,820
your podcast should be marked as explicit.

592
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,820
Yeah.

593
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,820
And Apple just couldn't figure out the content of the email that the complaint was about them,

594
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,820
not about you.

595
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
Yeah.

596
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,820
You just, your show just made a really good example of how it was just arbitrarily enforced.

597
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Yeah.

598
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,820
The only way you can report to them because getting a hold of apple is a little difficult.

599
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,820
The only thing you could do is you could say report a concern within the iTunes music store.

600
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
You're a reporter concern.

601
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
I say this podcast.

602
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820
We marked as explicit.

603
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
And I explained.

604
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I said, hey, you have a double standard here.

605
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,820
You came down a dig nation, but you've not come down on other podcasts.

606
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,820
And Adam, trust me, you are not the only one who says the occasional swear word,

607
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,820
but does not have an explicit tag on their podcast.

608
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
Yep.

609
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,820
So anyways, we just want to say, say whatever the fuck you want, we don't care.

610
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
You know, the explicit tag is not meant.

611
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
I don't even care if you have the explicit tag on there.

612
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,820
But it is nice to know, you know, we don't want our 40-year-old listening to the show.

613
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Yeah.

614
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,820
But beyond that, we don't care what you say.

615
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,820
We're going to keep listening.

616
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
We love the show.

617
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
We're going to keep listening.

618
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,820
Yep.

619
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,820
We appreciate it.

620
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,820
We enjoy it.

621
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,820
Listen to it every day.

622
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,820
So that's it for us.

623
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
Thanks.

624
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
Thanks.

625
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
All right, Kevin and Beth.

626
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,820
You know, I wonder if there were any other people who registered to complain about the explicit tag.

627
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,820
If it was only based on one, that makes a lot of sense.

628
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,820
It'd just be funny to see if it was only one because yeah, you're absolutely right, of course.

629
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,820
And really, I don't care.

630
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
It's apples directory.

631
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,820
They can do whatever they want.

632
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:48,820
By the way, I think they're starting to lose their edge a little bit on the on what they what Apple dubbed the indie casters, which I still love.

633
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Because they're really filling it up now with all kinds of mainstream stuff.

634
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
They're cutting deals.

635
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,820
All they're excitement is about television stuff for the video I pod.

636
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,820
That's really what they seem to be pushing.

637
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,820
So I strongly suggest that that you look at podcast,

638
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,820
dot com or indie potter dot org or pod cast pickle or.

639
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,820
You know, any myriad of other directories if you're really looking for something and want to make sure that you're listed properly there.

640
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
But hey, that's it's apples directory.

641
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,820
So, you know, they can totally do whatever they want to do.

642
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,820
It's just a little unfortunate that it's impossible to make everybody happy all of the time.

643
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
And, you know, add to that technical problems.

644
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
I know that they're having technical problems.

645
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:39,820
There's no other way it has to be something like that because, you know, all the things that are happening are not because, you know, they're sitting there reviewing every single podcast and you have some kind of magical process.

646
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,820
It's probably very, very labor intensive and very frustrating and.

647
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,820
You know, so be it.

648
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,820
So probably easier for Apple to do all of the mainstream stuff and do that really well.

649
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,820
And I enjoy that, you know, I and you know, and tie into the indie potters.

650
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,820
That's fine indie pod casters.

651
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,820
So, or, you know, give me the lost television series to buy and make sure that you show me that there's also.

652
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,820
Not one podcast, the official lost podcast with multiple.

653
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
There's one from Hawaii.

654
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Maybe I think two from Hawaii that are lost podcast.

655
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,820
You know, link to that.

656
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
That's that's what you should be doing.

657
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,820
I think that's a, that's a really good idea.

658
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,820
And, you know, and thank God we still have things like the pod finder to steer people towards.

659
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Although a very limited scope, at least steer them towards more independent podcasts.

660
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Apple's doing their best. They know, they know what they've got to do and that's the way they work.

661
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,820
So they'll do it the way they can do it.

662
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:37,820
So let's not try to rely too much on them or Microsoft or Google or anybody else.

663
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,820
Right. I only on me got damage.

664
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Interesting article a media week that I was pointed to that came out two days ago.

665
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,820
New study found the 12 to 24 year olds prefer their iPods over traditional radio.

666
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,820
This is according to bridge ratings.

667
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:03,820
According to bridge 85% said they would choose their MP3 players over traditional radio as their preferred option for music.

668
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,820
Survey response also preferred internet radio over AM and FM.

669
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:14,820
The study, which was, which interviewed 2,000 persons aged 12 to 24 was conducted as part of the University of Southern California's media lab.

670
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,820
How to make music radio appealing to the next generation analysis. That's a mouthful.

671
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,820
So you can read this yourself, but it does definitely show a trend.

672
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,820
It seems like a pretty small sample, 2000.

673
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,820
Again, I'm not a statistician, but maybe it's enough of a sample.

674
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,820
But I don't even need the study to know that that's where it's going.

675
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,820
And that's where being stuff like the pod safe music network comes into play.

676
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,820
That's where my daughter is now. Actually, she's tuning into podcast and she's going to artists websites and downloading.

677
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Downloading MP3s that she likes and then she's telling your friends about them through instant messenger.

678
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,820
It just doesn't stop.

679
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
Hello, this is Nia Beta.

680
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
I've got something to tell you.

681
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Hey guys here. Let's get ready now.

682
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,820
Let's grab a pod show.

683
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
What is this?

684
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,820
On the first day of Christmas, my iPod played for me.

685
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Adam Curry's daily source code.

686
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,820
The second day of Christmas, my iPod played for me.

687
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,820
The time show.

688
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,820
And Adam Curry's daily source code.

689
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
There's no school.

690
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,820
There's no school.

691
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,820
On the day of Christmas, my iPod played for me.

692
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,820
I guess for one one.

693
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
The time show.

694
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,820
And Adam Curry's daily source code.

695
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,820
On the fourth day of Christmas, my iPod played for me.

696
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,820
History podcast.

697
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,820
Podcast show.

698
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
One.

699
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,820
The end show.

700
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,820
And Adele's year of joy.

701
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
The end of year.

702
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Charlie.

703
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,820
Baby.

704
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Yes.

705
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820

One, two, three, four, five.

My spring pod gas rich as radio.

735
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820

761
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,820

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,820
Thank you so much.

763
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,820

That's fantastic.

779
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,820
You know, last year we got, let me see if I can find that.

780
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Last year we did the 12 days of podcasting.

781
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,820
It was not, not the same production.

782
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
Hold on a second.

783
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,820
12 days of podcasting.

784
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
Come on, Google.

785
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
Do your thing.

786
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,820
Show it to me, baby.

787
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,820
12 days of damn if it isn't there.

788
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,820
Um, shoot.

789
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
Should we play that?

790
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Yeah, let's play that.

791
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
Let's see.

792
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,820
This is what we did one year ago.

793
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,820
With a much smaller universe of podcasters.

794
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,820
This is interesting.

795
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Oh, bad request invalid host name.

796
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,820

Oh, wait.

800
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
Don't do that.

801
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
Maybe it's here.

802
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,820
This is horrible.

803
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,820
Okay, let me see if it's here.

804
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Let's give another shot.

805
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,820
Hold on.

806
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,820

And then closures in an XML tree.

829
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,820
There you go.

830
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
That was one year ago.

831
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,820
We have without a doubt.

832
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,820
Come quite a long way.

833
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,820
Judging on the, I should have played them in the reverse order, I guess.

834
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
Now, I love them both, obviously.

835
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,820
Both with the same beautiful intentions.

836
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Wow.

Hey, good news.

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,820
Slaw got the website up for pod save for peace.

842
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
That's the song.

843
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,820
39 pod.

844
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,820
Let me go to that side.

845
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,820
Well, what the hell?

846
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
Well, we're at it.

847
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,820
39 podcasters participated.

848
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,820
I'm sorry.

849
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Pod save music artists participated.

Let me see.

851
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,820
Pod.

852
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
Safe.

853
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,820
Peace.

854
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,820
Org.

855
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,820
And here we go.

856
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,820
If every day we're Christmas is the result of a unique benefit project.

857
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,820
The song is a collaboration between 32 singers from eight countries.

858
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,820
A group collectively known as pod save for peace.

859
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,820
All brought together by the populous phenomenon phenomenon.

860
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
The, the, the, the, the, the of pod casting.

861
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,820
And the desire to pool their talents for a worthy cause.

862
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,820
A few causes make more sense of Christmas time.

863
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Oh, and few causes make more sense of Christmas time.

864
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,820
The unicef, which aids children in need around the world.

865
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,820
The song was produced by Slaw and co-written by Orlando Pagan.

866
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:20,820
And the, the greatest part of the site that, that Slaw has got up and running here is that you can actually buy the song.

867
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,820
All proceeds go to unicef.

868
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,820
99 cents going, we're having tremendous problems getting into iTunes.

869
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,820
And I don't think it really matters.

870
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
And you know, if we send everyone to pod save for peace.org.

871
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,820
You can use PayPal or other methods to, to purchase the song.

872
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
It's a plain MP3.

873
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,820
There's no DRM or anything like that.

874
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,820
Let's, let's show, not just, you know, the world and unicef.

875
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
What we can do.

876
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
But it's also show the RIA.

877
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,820
What we can do.

878
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,820
I really believe in, in human nature.

879
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,820
But this, are you coming in?

880
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Look, here's the website, baby.

881
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820

Oh, nice.

886
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
I think I chose that picture.

887
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
You like it?

888
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
Yeah.

889
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,820
It's a nice picture, isn't it?

890
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
Isn't that cool?

891
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
Interesting.

892
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,820
What do you think about the song?

893
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
I love it.

894
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,820
Yeah.

895
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Yeah, it's an earworm.

896
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,820
An earworm.

897
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
Mm-hmm.

898
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
Hey, you look cute with that hat.

899
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
Okay.

900
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
Fine.

901
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,820
Go in.

902
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
Doing the show.

903
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,820
Genius at work.

904
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,820
Yeah.

905
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,820
The help.

906
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
Love you.

907
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
Love you too.

908
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,820
Bye.

909
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,820
So here's the song that I'm talking about.

910
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,820
Pot save for peace.org or go over by it and support a worthy cause.

911
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,820
First winter snow outside my window.

912
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,820
Feels like that time again to me.

913
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,820
The mistletoe.

914
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,820
A Christmas show.

915
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:01,820
And the lighting of that famous Christmas tree.

916
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:07,820
All our shopping for them loved ones.

917
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,820
And making plans for Christmas feats.

918
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,820
Burning all goes by.

919
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,820
And the rain goes by.

920
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,820
And then we have to wait.

921
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,820
Another year.

922
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,820
We've got every day.

923
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,820
Christmas.

924
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,820
What a wonderful world.

925
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,820
This one free.

926
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,820
It will never be a proof.

927
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,820
We make all our dreams come true.

928
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:51,820
Every month we're every day.

929
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,820
It's time to bring out the good people.

930
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,820
I just look around now and you'll see it.

931
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,820
Everybody's nice and full of light.

932
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,820
And they get to those who aren't me.

933
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,820
And they get by every day.

934
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,820
Christmas.

935
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,820
What a wonderful world.

936
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,820
This one free.

We make all our dreams come true.

939
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Every month we're every day.

940
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,820

941

And they get by every day.

942
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,820
Christmas.

943
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,820
What a wonderful world.

944
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,820

This one free.

948

We may call the trees on you

950

We will never be alone, we will never be alone

959

961
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:29,420
that actually the play music are do report into what's at the BDS system and you know

962
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,500
so stuff gets does get picked up so hopefully we can get in there. I'm going to send

963
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:41,180
it to a couple of program directors slash program directors that I know because this song

964
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,660
is registered with AskCabby and my podcast has had permission to play it in their shows but if

965
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,620
it gets played on the radio then money comes in I think that's great so I don't go you know all

966
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:56,700
the profits proceeds from that will go to unicef. I can't say enough podsafe for piece dot org.

967
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,100
A couple more pieces of feedback one more podsafe tune them right here for today.

968
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,980
Hey Adam this is Eric. I have two bits of feedback about DSC 292.

969
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,580
One I was glad to hear you say that you know there's more to pod casting than music.

970
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:17,820
I run a fan base podcast about a sci-fi show and music plays a very minor role in it you know

971
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,700
sure the show is pretty much all discussion so you know I wasn't sure if you wanted feedback

972
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:28,700
from people that aren't music oriented per se and you know focused on the PMN and things like that.

973
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,980
The other thing is I know you've lived in Jersey or on the East Coast somewhere and I live

974
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,100
right outside Washington DC and I tell you the fox problem you're having over there we are being

975
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,700
overrun by foxes over here. You know I grew up in this area and I'd never saw fox growing up

976
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,580
and you know I recently moved back here a couple years ago and the foxes are just completely

977
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,380
approaching and you know plotting a takeover of suburbia so it's not just over there.

978
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,220
Also since I know you like to watch lost I would invite you to listen to my podcast

979
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:06,220
Firefly Talk which is all about a show called Firefly which if you're not familiar with it it's

980
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,900
it's a very funny Joss Weedon show he did buffy the vampire slayer. This show is a lot more mature

981
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:19,100
it's sort of a post apocalyptic sci-fi adventure with sort of a western flair to it. It's got lots

982
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,900
of guns and horse and if you haven't seen that show you should definitely give it a try so

983
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,220
anyways thanks a lot Adam for everything you're doing I'm a big fan I listen to you every day

984
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:37,260
and keep up the good work. Alright guns and horse? Hmm Firefly. I don't think I've come across

985
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,820
that anywhere does anyone know if I can get that on my skyside light that'll be cool I'll

986
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,060
definitely watch it based on that recommendation cool man appreciate it and appreciate the feedback

I've got a lot to do

1046
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,460
I've got a lot to do

1047
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,460
I've got a lot to do

1048
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,460
I've got a lot to do

1049
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,260
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1050
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,660
The music played in your room.

1051
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:54,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1052
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1053
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,460
The music played in your room.

1054
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1055
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,460
The music played in your room.

1056
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1057
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,460
The music played in your room.

1058
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1059
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,460
The music played in your room.

1060
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1061
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:34,460
The music played in your room.

1062
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1063
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,460
The music played in your room.

1064
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1065
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,460
The music played in your room.

1066
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:54,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1067
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,460
The music played in your room.

1068
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,460
The music played in your room.

1069
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:13,460
All of a sudden, do I worry what I said?

1070
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,580
Man, we've called a lot of ground.

1071
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:20,260
The only thing I didn't get around to was asking if anyone out there knows how ask,

1072
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,820
and this is just a music business question.

1073
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,460
So if you're a published artist, you may have the answer for me.

1074
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:32,140
If you are registered with Ask Have Be Am I and you start getting airplay overseas,

1075
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,420
how is that money collected?

1076
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:42,540
And subsequent to that, can you as a foreigner, not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the

1077
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,780
United States, can you register with Ask Have Be Am I and thus have performance royalties

1078
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:53,140
collected in different countries through, through however it's done today?

1079
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,140
Does that make sense?

1080
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,140
That question?

1081
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,140
Because that way, artists who are having all these issues with not being allowed to give

1082
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,540
podcasts, there's permission to play their tunes on podcasts could be circumvented.

1083
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,540
Excuse me.

1084
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,620
If they were to sign up with Ask Have Be Am I.

1085
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:15,860
So that's my question, do you or dailysourcecode.com, Adam at curry.com.

1086
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,620
I will be back here tomorrow with a Thursday's edition of the Delta Sierra Charity Daily

1087
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,620
Source Code.

1088
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:26,620
Take care, everybody.

1089
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,620
Pot Show.

1090
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,060
The podcast, cool kids, go for.
