1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
In the source code, my third is out by h and h.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,760
Oh I wonder why, why, why, why, why, why?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,420
And this is one DJ, you don't want to fuck with.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:10,720
Cmondado!

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,760
Hey everybody,

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,560
that once again some studio stages.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,120
This is the Daily Source Code coming to you from just outside

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,080
the BBC studios.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,680
To be precise, that would be the Southern Counties radio studios of the BBC, located

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,840
at Surrey University right outside of Gilford.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,400
Oh man, I'm really pumping the tombs here.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,920
I got so many great responses to the past two days doing the podcast with St. Christina

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
yesterday and in the kitchen the day before that I figured well.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,680
Maybe I just try to get my act together and do everything on remote or on location and

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,520
just carry everything with me, which of course has me now carrying around tons of wires

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:13,200
and my iPod and my iPod and all the gear that you need as well as my show notes in paper

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
form.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
So it's the third of March, 2005.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:25,400
So the first thing I want to talk about is this interview that I just did.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,160
I've been here to the Southern Counties radio studio where they have an ISDN set which

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:41,880
is basically a little mixer and a bridge that connects two studios together and have a microphone

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,880
and some headphones.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,440
Kind of like some stuff that the equipment I think dates back from the 70s, it's pretty

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,040
cruddy stuff but at least it works and I've been here several times whenever the BBC

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,960
wanted to interview me and today it was and I've actually, I've said no in the past couple

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,720
of weeks but this was for BBC Radio 4 which is I guess it's the pretty much the premiere

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,080
like talk station for the BBC and I know that my neighbors listen to it and I'd love

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
for Marion and Jimmy to hear me on Radio 4 so they'd know what the hell I'm doing and they'd

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,480
finally could put some clues into place just to why I used to sit outside in my car in

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
halfway between their driveway and the next neighbors sucking off bandwidth you know and

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,800
what all this pod iPod stuff is about this pod casting so and let's see I was interviewed by

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:50,080
you just see here I was interviewed by Rosie Goldsmith and this will air on April 1st can you

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,960
believe that I mean April 1st that's like in a month is when they're going to air this I mean

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,800
gee whiz anything could happen between now and then that was uh I kind of surprised me at the end

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,240
there let me just hit the the hold button here on the i River so that I don't accidentally

36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:16,080
stop the recording um if he was kind of confrontational you know talking about uh it was actually

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,800
it was pretty much a version of uh of you know mainstream media press saying web bloggers are you

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,840
journalists and their pajamas who's kind of like well this is all amateur radio stuff and uh you

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,960
know do you think you'll ever get professional I said well excuse me I've been broadcasting since

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,200
I was 14 I'm a professional you know I've been paid lots of money to do radio programs and I'm doing

41
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,000
you know my own creative thing uh only I'm doing it you know in a different distribution mechanism

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,200
and there was something wonderful and I love it when when journalists report us do this and uh

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,920
you know it's never gonna make make the air and you know I should have started the recording of

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,160
today's source code while doing that interview but uh I knew there would be no way to get both

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,760
what they were saying and I was saying so I figured I wouldn't do it but um what was the question

46
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,840
let me think if I can I want to I don't want to miss a quote around this um she said um oops that's

47
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,520
my uh my i-trip basically stopping okay I see when the iPod shuts off then the i-trip of course

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,320
has no juice um she said well you know there's a reason for oh no um so unlike professional

49
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:34,320
radio broadcast where there's a production and there's an editor and there's this whole process

50
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,480
which of of course is uh is necessary and I said well why is it necessary why do you need all that

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,880
she said well I'm not going to answer your questions okay that's fine so um anyway we've got a

52
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,040
got a ways to go clearly so I'm back into car as you can tell I'm flying myself let me uh

53
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,040
put the sheet well darn through the whoops through all the wires here I got my headphones I got the

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,320
microphone but we do want to be safe let me see if I can position this mic a little bit better for

55
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,600
y'all as I'm driving trying to find a good spot to put it so we have a maximum sound okay that's

56
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,760
probably good there um yeah take a look my show notes because what I want to do is I want to

57
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,280
back up it's actually gonna be quite a job to get out of here I wish you could see where it is

58
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,840
it's really inconvenient and I have to back this mother load boat of a car through a very narrow passage

59
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,240
way so just bear with me on this for a second and of course there's cars parked on all sides just to make

60
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,840
my life a little more interesting okay let's see this is one of those where you actually have to do

61
00:05:51,840 --> 00:06:01,760
it on driving your mirrors okay we're doing good and there's some whoops some audible help from

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:12,960
from the a8 the technicians at Audi woo this is tight so basically it's saying you are very close to

63
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:22,640
obstacle sir okay so I'm looking good looking good whoops I mean I should shoot I wish I should

64
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,200
I got to bring my camera along for these rides you would not believe how tightly packed this is

65
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,240
this parking lot so now I'm probably gonna hit a little curb here as I back it out

66
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:46,400
okay I actually have to now back down the hill in reverse because I can't turn around my goodness

67
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,200
for the attitude the BBC has you'd expect that I have a little better facilities okay

68
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,480
right oh okay so now I'm going down the hill in reverse you know what the screw it I'm going to go

69
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:09,360
open see if I can turn them there all right while I'm doing this let's go to our first track today

70
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,200
which I've got cut up here on the iPod which we're gonna play for you now through the

71
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,480
stereo system so the great mashup that I found I thought you to enjoy it it's uh

72
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:30,640
rather unusual version of let it be enjoy for a couple minutes

73
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:39,680
let it be let it be let it be let it be let it be let it be let it be let it be let it be let it be

74
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:54,480
let it be let it be let it be let it it be jelly

75
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

76
00:10:39,680 --> 00:11:09,680
let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let

77
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:19,760
go, let's go, let's go, let's go to the seats, go, let's go, let's go.

78
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,280
All right how many different songs did you hear in that Mashup, huh? No woman no cry,

79
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:33,500
a little bit of chili peppers in there and of course let it be by the beetles and as you

80
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:42,260
You can tell I've taken to mixing longer tracks right in so that, you know, you don't

81
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,020
just hear car noise the whole time, but you actually hear the track.

82
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,300
Now I'm doing that in post-production, which is only necessary because I don't really

83
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,460
have the required setup, the right tools to do it live.

84
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,700
I've been looking desperately for a little battery powered mixer that'll just take

85
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,980
a microphone and then, you know, hopefully with maybe a little bit of effects or

86
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:14,300
processing or at least some, some equalizer settings and then one, but preferably two

87
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,900
line inputs and then of course I wanted to have a headphone amplifier and it would

88
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,460
have to have an out so that I could route that to my recording device, which is the

89
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,820
I River IFP799 and then of course I wanted all in one box that I can just take with me.

90
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,860
Now I have all kinds of things strapped together and actually on the way over I was thinking

91
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:44,220
about this, maybe there's a way to combine all this in one of these smart phones, maybe

92
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:51,900
a trio or perhaps a Microsoft smart phone because what I'm looking for is the following elements,

93
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:59,900
I need to be able to record my voice, I need to be able to mix in MP3s with that, you know,

94
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:06,020
and literally in real mix, right, not recording from the speaker through the microphone,

95
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:12,340
but you know, some little software actually has to be built and it would be even cooler

96
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,500
if you could add to that, see some of these phones have Wi-Fi and it's so that I could

97
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,260
actually hook up to a network and perhaps utilize a handheld version of Skype.

98
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,220
Give me that and I'm your man, I'm telling you, I mean, how hard can it be?

99
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,660
I think that there are handheld devices out there that have all of these elements, we just

100
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,940
need to kind of strap them all together and please don't make me go learn, you know,

101
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,460
dot net or visual basic or some crap like that to get it done, surely there's some developer

102
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,980
out there who's thinking, hmm, maybe that first Apple script that turned an iPod or maybe

103
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,460
something there and I could go create something cool that people use as well, so, you

104
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:57,940
know, don't wait around, I mean, Microsoft say what you will but they certainly provide tools

105
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,700
for developers, so, you know, let's get cracking at, I mean, I wouldn't need my computer

106
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,780
anymore if I could, if I could do it all on one device, but I have to, you know, and by

107
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,620
the way, make, you know, hook up the buttons on the phone so you can, you know, map them

108
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,300
to like starting a track or open up the microphone or something like that and if anyone

109
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,060
out there feels they can develop this application, you know, I will be your number one

110
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,100
beta tester and I will certainly, you know, take it around the block for multiple spins

111
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:34,100
to, to make sure that it's, you know, that, that it's, it's matching the requirements.

112
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,340
Let's see, so, and also, it'll be great if I could have an outline on that for my show

113
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:44,140
notes because now I just have a piece of paper with basically a screen shot of my outline.

114
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,660
And one of the things I need to talk to you about that I wrote down is, Libsin, just

115
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:55,820
what, Libra is indication, they're a podcast, infrastructure provider, I guess, place

116
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,420
where you can go drop your podcasts, they give you some file management, your RSS feed is

117
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,380
created, you get a little show notes blog, really quite simple.

118
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,940
And I mistakenly said that their pricing was, was a little bit too high for the, for the

119
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,820
small amount of data that they were allowing and I received an email about that, which,

120
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:25,660
of course, you can all retrieve from the show notes at dailysourcecode.com or from www.curry.com.

121
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,380
Essentially, they have unmetored bandwidth and you're paying for the storage for the number

122
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,380
of files.

123
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,100
I think you start like it, five bucks for storing 100 megs worth of files, which is probably

124
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,140
good, in my case, for about five shows, but of course, you could, you know, move one

125
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,860
off archive at somewhere else or whatever, but the bandwidth is unmetored.

126
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,980
So, I was mistaken about that, which makes that actually much more, you know, much more

127
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,300
attractive proposition.

128
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,740
And if anyone out there has knows about networking, maybe you can explain this to me.

129
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:06,220
I've, it's been, people have tried to explain to me that internet service providers or hosting

130
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,860
companies that have a tremendous amount of data traffic that is being requested from their

131
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,620
network that is actually a benefit to them if they can provide that.

132
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,940
So, whereas you might think, oh my gosh, you know, all this, this traffic that they're

133
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,460
sending out, only cost gobs and gobs of money, it is my understanding, and again, I'm

134
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,580
not quite sure how it works.

135
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:37,500
It is my understanding that that is actually advantageous to a web host provider or an ISP

136
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,420
who provides, who actually is hosting those shows.

137
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,940
I'm not quite sure how it works.

138
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,660
I don't know if it has something to do with peering agreements or, you know, whatever it

139
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,580
is, but if that is true, I'd love to know how it works, because they know that stuff

140
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,820
that happens up in the so-called cloud is just really, really fuzzy.

141
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,620
I just, you know, I'm not quite sure I understand.

142
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,180
So, Adam McCree dot com if I'm just siren, let's come it up, let me see, is that it's

143
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,180
coming closer?

144
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,180
Is it here?

145
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Oh ambulance?

146
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,820
Okay, I'm sorry ambulance service.

147
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Okay, now I see, this is where I got to go over to my iPod again, and I got to line up

148
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,820
the next track.

149
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,420
Oh, this is great.

150
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,140
I came across this on openpodcast.org, and it just blew me away.

151
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,380
Let's listen to this little history lesson, which will actually help us, perhaps, understand

152
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
the future somewhat.

153
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:38,540
You're not fully matured in 1933 when Armstrong invented FM radio.

154
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,780
They developed a receiver and a transmitter to drive it.

155
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,180
They could tell the difference between lightning electric motors, atmospheric interference,

156
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,620
and the radio broadcast itself.

157
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,420
So you'd think that his employer, RSEA, would jump to the new technology.

158
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,620
Instead, they did everything they could to kill it.

159
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,620
Why?

160
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,860
RSEA owned two radio networks in BC Red and in BC Blue, and some of the biggest radio stations

161
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,620
that served large areas of the country.

162
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,620
The stations that were protected against interference from smaller stations.

163
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,180
FM stations would take away from NBC's power of position, so they sat on FM, and Armstrong

164
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,580
ultimately killed himself.

165
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,300
It's happening again.

166
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,580
The big players, the phone companies, the terrestrial broadcasters, the old-line media

167
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,540
rights holders, see their monopolies ending and their playing dirty, and it's only the

168
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
beginning.

169
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,420
Bill South told Lafayette Louisiana that if Lafayette utilities lay his fiber, Bill South

170
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,780
will pull its singular wireless call center out of the city, and the jobs along with it.

171
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,860
Texas Legislator Phil King, rich from big media corporate donations, is introduced

172
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,100
to Bill to keep municipalities from installing broadband.

173
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,900
Vonage is complained to the FCC about a rural telephone company who has blocked voice

174
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,580
over IP on its internet connections, presumably, so that you'll use their phone instead.

175
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,580
In Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, voted against a bill that would extend

176
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,260
in decency regulation to cable, but he has told the group of broadcasters that he might

177
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,540
be changing his mind.

178
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,900
That's the latest way to support terrestrial broadcast owners.

179
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,740
Make the competition illegal.

180
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,340
If you dumb down cable and satellite radio, you get the same shit being shoveled over

181
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,740
the air.

182
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,620
Get ready, because direct internet delivery is next.

183
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:33,140
A Los Angeles radio station owner petitioned the FCC last year to regulate XM and serious.

184
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,260
Sal the Vines said he wasn't anti-free speech.

185
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,380
He just wanted a level playing field, but the FCC's Powell sentiment out and said since

186
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,380
kids can't receive satellite without their parents entering into an agreement, it just wasn't

187
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
the same.

188
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,700
So where are we?

189
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,340
Vonage once the FCC to regulate Lex who regulate content by making it legal the

190
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,060
block ports used for VoIP.

191
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,460
The FCC hasn't decided that when yet, but has told Sal of Ian, that satellite radio

192
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,500
gets a pass because kids can't get it.

193
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,060
Kids can get podcasts.

194
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,700
In fact, they're more likely to get them, so VoIP may not be the only four-liter word

195
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,340
they regulate.

196
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,300
And who benefits from all this?

197
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,060
Legacy providers in Big Media, who loses the public and the poorer you are, the more you

198
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,300
lose.

199
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,380
I really like Lawrence Lessig's take on this on his wired podcast.

200
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,740
Governor Ed Rendell last year signed an anti-manusable Wi-Fi bill in Pennsylvania.

201
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,820
This is a pretty hard thing to sell, and he had to exempt Philadelphia because half the

202
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,260
poorer neighborhoods would probably get no internet if it applied to everybody.

203
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,940
But the gov dusted off that old socialism argument, which proves how far these guys are

204
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,420
willing to go to take away from the people and make it look like there's some higher

205
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,940
purpose in it.

206
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,620
Lessig really skewered him on it.

207
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,140
For if you look closely, you'll see that the communist menace has infiltrated governments

208
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,460
everywhere.

209
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,900
Ever noticed those free photons as you walk the city streets at night?

210
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,940
Everything about the poor, street lamp companies run out of business because municipalities

211
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,780
dain to do completely what private industry would only do incompletely.

212
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,700
Yeah, yeah, but we're all preaching to the choir here.

213
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,580
And most of the folks who remember the last time arguments like this were used are dead

214
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,580
or dying.

215
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,860
This is Adolf Margeau speaking.

216
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,900
If the Visionski or Molotov had been sitting in Congress during the past six years, they

217
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,900
could not have voted against the unemellican activities committee more consistently than

218
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,900
did Helen Douglas.

219
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,780
If she had had her way, a swarm of pro-Soviet turmites would still be knowing away

220
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,820
at the foundations of our government.

221
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,060
And now Mrs. Douglas hailed by the Communist line press as one of the heroes of the

222
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,580
area of Congress, this contesting for the seat in the United States Senate against Congressman

223
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
Richard Nixon.

224
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,420
One thing you can be sure, every communist and California will vote for Mrs. Douglas.

225
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,700
Now let's prompt them and tell you the votes for Richard Nixon, a man who is dignified

226
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,980
the House of Representatives by his presence in his actions.

227
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,860
People who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

228
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,660
But that's just my opinion, as plagiarized from George Santa Ana.

229
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,780
So I'm not quite sure who created this.

230
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,060
It's podcast 1186 on openpodcast.org.

231
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:29,140
Voight is a four or voice over IP is a four letter word by PBC Liberal, excellent piece.

232
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
Enjoy that very much.

233
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,500
And by now I've actually arrived home.

234
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:41,580
So I'm going to see disconnect some stuff here and we're going to go inside.

235
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,220
We'll continue from there because I have the same playlist.

236
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,820
Now of course I've got to figure out how to carry all this stuff at the same time.

237
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Let's see.

238
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,220
I've put the receiver side in the eye river in my pocket transmitter.

239
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,500
We don't need no stink in transmitters.

240
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,220
And the other pocket over here.

241
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,340
Okay, well, let's slap the iPod in there.

242
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
Show notes.

243
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,340
Okay.

244
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,340
Is that tight squeeze?

245
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
Okay.

246
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,340
There we go.

247
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,340
It's not a very nice day today.

248
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:25,340
Put the mic as close.

249
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,340
What are we doing here?

250
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
Oh hi, Pussycat.

251
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,340
Hello.

252
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,340
What's wrong?

253
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
Baby.

254
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,340
What is there?

255
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Here.

256
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,340
What's wrong with you?

257
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,340
What's wrong?

258
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
What's wrong?

259
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,340
It's a beautiful like Siamese cat.

260
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
What's wrong?

261
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
Let me pet him.

262
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,340
Oh, he looks okay.

263
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,340
There's no collar.

264
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,340
I wonder if he belongs here.

265
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
Maybe he's one of the neighbors cats.

266
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,340
When you're making such a racket about baby, you make such a racket about.

267
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Okay, seems very friendly.

268
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
All right.

269
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,340
Maybe just wanted some attention.

270
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,340
So we'll leave him for what he is.

271
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,340
Let's move on.

272
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,340
You can hear the wind.

273
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:25,340
Not only is it cold, but the wind is just flowing down off the downs.

274
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:35,340
Hello.

275
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,340
Hello.

276
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,340
I'm podcasting.

277
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
Yes.

278
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Hello.

279
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
Hello.

280
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,340
I hope it doesn't finish off.

281
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,340
BBC 4 confrontational.

282
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,340
Yeah.

283
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
So this is all just amateurs.

284
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340
Excuse me.

285
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,340
I think I'm pretty damn professional.

286
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
I've been doing it since I was 14.

287
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
And I've been paid lots of money to.

288
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,340
She.

289
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,340
She.

290
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
That's not the point.

291
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,340
She was just saying podcasting is just amateurs.

292
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
Exactly.

293
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340
That's the face I made.

294
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,340
I hear a lot more amateurs on there.

295
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,340
On the radio.

296
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Oh.

297
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,340
And I went through this whole thing and said, you know, what?

298
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,340
Why?

299
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,340
Why does this appeal to?

300
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,340
It's fine.

301
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Shoot.

302
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
So why does this appeal to people?

303
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,340
I said because we're living in a world of fakeness.

304
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,340
Yeah.

305
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
And we're tied to fake.

306
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
I said, pick up a women's magazine.

307
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,340
Look at Kate Moss with her to get the Rimal London look.

308
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
Yeah.

309
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
So she's wearing eyelash.

310
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Fake eyelashes.

311
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,340
For selling mascara that makes your eyelashes look long.

312
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
Yeah.

313
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
And her life sucks.

314
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Thank you.

315
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Thank you, dear.

316
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,340
Oh, shoot.

317
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,340
I got a major crackling side.

318
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,340
Yeah.

319
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
What's she hanging out with that Pete guy?

320
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,340
That drug addict?

321
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,340
Yeah.

322
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
I think he's over now.

323
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
Hey, we're in jail.

324
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,340
Yeah.

325
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,340
Yeah.

326
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,340
Okay.

327
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,340
I'm going to go upstairs and finish.

328
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,340
I don't know what's going on here with me.

329
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,340
I hope you're not hearing that.

330
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,340
For some reason.

331
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,340
I'm getting major interference.

332
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
Hold on.

333
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,340
Maybe.

334
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Just a minute or the receiver.

335
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:20,340
Maybe it's just all the frickin' frequencies being used throughout the house.

336
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
So I'm going to have...

337
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
There we go.

338
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,340
It was the transmitter.

339
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,340
Probably hitting up against something.

340
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:33,340
I've got three Wi-Fi hotspots in the house.

341
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,340
We've got cordless telephones.

342
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,340
We've got wireless transmitters for...

343
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,340
Or transmitter pair for the television, the kitchen.

344
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,340
Shoot.

345
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
So, you know.

346
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,340
We've got to think that that's got to have something to do with it.

347
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,340
Okay.

348
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:01,340
So, I think I should be able to bring up my playlist here of stuff that I was playing.

349
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,340
Okay.

350
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Yes.

351
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
What was I going to do next?

352
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
What's our time frame here?

353
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
Okay.

354
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
10 minutes left.

355
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,340
Well, then, of course, we've got to play the final countdown.

356
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Your president at his best.

357
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
Turn, turn, turn.

358
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
Evil is real.

359
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Evil is real.

360
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
Evil is real.

361
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,340
Evil is real.

362
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,340
Evil is real.

363
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
8 years.

364
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,340
It is a totalitarian political ideology to do it.

365
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,340
Proceed with consuming zeal and do it.

366
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,340
And without conscience, do it.

367
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,340
Bring them on.

368
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,340
tyranny and terrorism dot dot.

369
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,340
I'm George W. Bush and I approve this and I want to share with you.

370
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,340
Carry representing the geneticism, resentment, and terror.

371
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
Made long ago on the day of our founding.

372
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
We affirm it again today.

373
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,340
Do it.

374
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,340
I am determined to simmer in resentment and tyranny.

375
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,340
Prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder.

376
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Bring them on.

377
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,340
There can be no separate peace.

378
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Violence will gather and multiply and destructive power.

379
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
Bring them on.

380
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Each attack is designed to demoralize our people and divide us from one another.

381
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,340
The worst locomotive and raise a mortal threat to it.

382
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,340
There's a mindset that rejoices in suicide.

383
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
Do it.

384
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
Insights murder.

385
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,340
And celebrates every death when we release the shock truce of a hateful ideology.

386
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,340
Army to threaten the peace of the world.

387
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Bring them on.

388
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
Thousands of dangerous killers.

389
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,340
School in the methods of murder are now spread throughout the world.

390
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,340
Like the ticking time bombs.

391
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,340
Set to go off without warning.

392
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,340
America is a friend of the Muslim crowd.

393
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,340
Terror, terror, terror.

394
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,340
Violence, tyranny is not surrender to the country.

395
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,340
Your enemy is ruling your country.

396
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,340
Do it.

397
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,340
We're living together.

398
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,340
But still it's farewell.

399
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,340
And maybe we'll come back to burn.

400
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,340
Who can tell?

401
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,340
Like there is no one to blame.

402
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,340
We'll leave it grow.

403
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,340
Will things ever be the same again.

404
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Do it.

405
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,340
It's a fine no-to-one.

406
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,340
I believe in the solemn duty of the American president.

407
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,340
It's the district punishment for imaginary crimes.

408
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,340
We celebrate the reign of hatred.

409
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,340
The existence of permanent turning.

410
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,340
The possibility of permanent slavery.

411
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,340
We have led many have joined.

412
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,340
And America in the world is a complicated mess.

413
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:01,340
The wise excuse of America's strength is to advance the continuing danger of terrorism.

414
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,340
And all of this has confirmed one belief in the end.

415
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340
We've come this far.

416
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Our tested and confident nations can achieve anything.

417
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,340
Eight years of more dark violence will gather.

418
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,340
Do it.

419
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Bring more.

420
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,340
We're in front of the map.

421
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,340
Evil is real.

422
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,340
So not really intended.

423
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,340
There's a political message more than an interesting mashup.

424
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,340
And good editing job on that with the final countdown.

425
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
By that wonderful Swedish band.

426
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
You heard, remember them?

427
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,340
You know, I was, see what, oh.

428
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,340
I got to skip a couple of things here just because of the time.

429
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Gmail mentioned the Gmail have been down a couple of times, which freaked me out a little bit.

430
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,340
And I got to email about that that perhaps it wasn't that they were down, but they might be performing an upgrade.

431
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Because now it seems that Gmail is working on more browsers, including some Linux flavors of browsers.

432
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,340
So maybe that Gmail is doing upgrades, which is great.

433
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,340
I'm still a big fan of the service.

434
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Some information about Father Roderick.

435
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
We've talked about him.

436
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,340
The Catholic Insider.com.

437
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,340
He has not actually gotten Vatican Radio to start podcasting along with his podcast.

438
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:19,340
Deep from the bowels of the Vatican where no journalists has ever gone before.

439
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
Catholic Insider.com.

440
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,340
I can't, I can't listen to that podcast enough.

441
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
I really, really dig it.

442
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:30,340
And I got some email from a Dutch listener because Father Roderick is a Dutch priest.

443
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,340
Who's been podcasting from the Vatican for the past week or so.

444
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,340
Turns out he's been active online for quite a while.

445
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,340
Actually, he's been found in the Star Wars realm.

446
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
He seems to be a geek.

447
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
A Star Wars geek.

448
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Which is cool.

449
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
And it makes total sense.

450
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,340
And I still get a kick out of him saying, oh my gosh.

451
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,340
Let's see.

452
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Oh, that's right.

453
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,340
The blast on the past.

454
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:02,340
The buddy of mine, Larry, who I met many, many years ago, is now up at Microsoft.

455
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,340
And is working in the Xbox division.

456
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Larry, why don't you come on in?

457
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Thanks, Adam.

458
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Hey, this is Larry.

459
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Her better known as Xbox Live's Major Nelson.

460
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,340
If you want to know what's going on with the future of gaming,

461
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,340
there's no better place than the 2005 Game Developers Conference,

462
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
March 7th through 10th in San Francisco.

463
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Not a game developer.

464
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
Can't make it.

465
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
But you still want to learn what the new trends are in gaming.

466
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,340
No problem.

467
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,340
Soon into my podcast at majornelson.com, and you'll be on the inside.

468
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Plus this year, I'll be podcasting Jay Howard's keynote speech about the future

469
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,340
of gaming unlocking the opportunity.

470
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,340
For more information and complete details, check out majornelson.com.

471
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,340
Now back to the Daily Source Code.

472
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
All right.

473
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
Thank you very much.

474
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,340
Ooh.

475
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
Nice Xbox sound there.

476
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
So at normal.

477
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,340
Yeah, I wouldn't just go and pull out stuff like that.

478
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,340
But I love the fact that Larry put a promo together and had it open ended.

479
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,340
You know, so I could toss to him and he toss back to me.

480
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:55,340
And a place where you can pick up promos, which I think is actually,

481
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,340
it might be something cool to look into.

482
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:04,340
If you like a certain show, podcastpromos.com has been created,

483
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,340
where you can essentially drop off a promo for your show,

484
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,340
and pick up promos from other shows.

485
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
And it's kind of like a radio daddy type of exchange,

486
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,340
where you can exchange a voiceover work on.

487
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,340
This is just purely for promos.

488
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,340
More information about that in the show notes for today's podcast.

489
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,340
On daily source code.com.

490
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,340
And now time for...

491
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Yeah.

492
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,340
There you see my thinking cap.

493
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
First, there have to put my thinking cap on.

494
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,340
Come on.

495
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
It's time for Adam.

496
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,340
I'm curious to take the hint to us.

497
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,340
With y'all.

498
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
Pull it.

499
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,340
I had him.

500
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
Hey, y'all number 19.

501
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
All right.

502
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Let's keep it short and simple.

503
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,340
And this is...

504
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,340
I'm on for that.

505
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,340
I know.

506
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,340
I know.

507
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,340
I know.

508
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
I know.

509
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
That's easy.

510
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
That would be...

511
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Odyssey going back to my roots.

512
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,340
Ooh.

513
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,340
Within the time limit even.

514
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,340
And this is number two.

515
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
Dubler?

516
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Something like that?

517
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
I don't know.

518
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,340
And this is number three.

519
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,340
It's hard.

520
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,340
Easy.

521
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Easy.

522
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,340
Time guns.

523
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Haven't some funds.

524
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Gotta be George Michael and Andrew Rizley.

525
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
And wham.

526
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,340
Two for three.

527
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
I think today.

528
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Time's up.

529
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Answer number one.

530
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
It's fun.

531
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
It's fun.

532
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
It's fun.

533
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
Yeah.

534
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Going back to my roots.

535
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,340
And we played this one to death on the pirate radio station.

536
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Back in the release.

537
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,340
Running for race, huh?

538
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,340
There you go.

539
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,340
There you go.

540
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,340
There you go.

541
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,340
There you go.

542
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,340
And so there you go.

543
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
We're back to my roots.

544
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,340
Yeah.

545
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,340
Do somebody come back.

546
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
Odyssey and going back to my roots.

547
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,340
And answer number one in today's internet station.

548
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,340
And this is answer number two.

549
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,340
I never would have guessed Johnny

550
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,340
Johnny gave a hood force later

551
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,340
One thing in a new addition with Bobby Brown

552
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,340
I'm saying duets with Stacey Lattipo

553
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,340
I never would have gotten out when you're too tough

554
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,340
I'm just so bad I'm just so bad

555
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Johnny gave an answer number two

556
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,340
and this is answer number three

557
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,340
George Michael, together with Andrew Richley

558
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,340
back in the days that they were called to win

559
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,340
This is Young Guns

560
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Hey, Saka

561
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,340
We're gonna get extra points for knowing Andrews name

562
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,340
And Pepsi and Shirley singing back a vocal

563
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,340
We don't know and try

564
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,340
All you could say

565
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
What's the point, George?

566
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,340
My fiance

567
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,340
Yeah

568
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
When

569
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
For third and final answer and Young Guns

570
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,340
Well this wraps up hit this number 19

571
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,340
Again, I hope you did well

572
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
And I thank you

573
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
Better than most days

574
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340

Let me see you next time for number 20 of the hit there

578
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Bye bye

579
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,340
That's our second or fourth lobster

580
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
What is that?

581
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Thank you very much Young Palette

582
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,340
As always for bringing us a little bit of joy

583
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,340
During the podcast

584
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,340
A little bit of brain teasing

585
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,340
That's it for today's Danny source code

586
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Just under the 40 minute mark

587
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,340
Tomorrow I'll be back

588
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,340
And I've asked Patricia to go and find some of her CDs

589
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Turns out they're actually here in my office

590
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,340
So I kind of picked them the other day

591
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,340
But I think it's time to play some of her work

592
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,340
I could talk about her career

593
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,340
That's going to be fun

594
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,340
So hopefully I can get it all together

595
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
To do that with her tomorrow

596
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,340
Oh shoot no wait a bit

597
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
Tomorrow I've got to go to London

598
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
Maybe we'll do it over the weekend

599
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,340
And what I'll do then is I'll probably do a podcast from London

600
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,340
As I'm being interviewed by Dutch television show

601
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,340
Which is kind of like

602
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,340
I'd say on the level of like Charlie Rose

603
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,340
You know so it's really intellectual

604
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
So I'll have to dress it really nice

605
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,340
And smartly and have Patricia be my hair

606
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
