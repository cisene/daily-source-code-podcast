1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 219er.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,600
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,960
Video is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who managed what you can hear since

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,600
radio is invented.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:42,600
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Now you can have it all.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I heard it on a podcast.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Rock and fucking radio, you want it.

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
You got it.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Just download it and put it on a podcast.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
No one's gonna stop you telling FCC to stick it, kick it,

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,600
the revolutions.

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
It's Adam Curry.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,600
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,600
I like to think I'm flying into this short.

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
It's Adam Curry.

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Hey everybody, how you doing?

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Yeah, I got a source code for you anyway.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
It's Monday the second.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Come on.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Come on.

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Come on.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Come on.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
For you, okay?

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
It is the daily source code good evening from the UK.

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
It's almost 10 30 p.m.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Drastic mistake.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,600
We had a really, really nice dinner and then I just kind of laid down on the couch and

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
well, I fell asleep.

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Oh boy, what an interesting day, interesting evening last night.

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,600
That's right, Patricia and I had a night in Big Smoke.

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,600
In the Big London town, the big L, as we went to the playboy party and of course had

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,600
our own parties, then we got to tell last night in the lovely Dorchester Hotel, which is just

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
off the park.

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
It was a very chic indeed.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I'll tell you a bit about the party.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Of course, I also recorded a sound scene tour.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,600
And let's get caught up on the stuff that's happened over the weekend.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,600
And Monday, oh my god, my day behind.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,600
So we actually got on the train around 1230.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
We've taken a car out to London.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
And it's just so much, and that was really because we were all kind of like dressed up

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
at a very departed year of last night.

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
And well, you know, I just didn't want to get a dress all wrinkled.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I don't want to get my dress wrinkled either.

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,600
We hopped on the train back today and actually started doing some editing on the way home.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
It was a fine-risingly spiky podcast.

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,600
And I've kind of been indoors for the rest of the day.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
So I missed all the beautiful weather.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
But I got a lot of cool things lined up for you.

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
You've got a backtracks podcast.

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,600
We've got some pretty unbelievable pod safe music ready to roll for you.

54
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Plenty of promo some news and lots of stuff to talk about right here on your daily source

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
code.

56
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
And this is new guy who's been creating mashups.

57
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,600
He's been playing a couple of his mashups on the pod show on serious.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
His name is DJ Earworm.

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
And he does the most amazing job at mashups.

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
This is definitely one of my favorites.

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Is this stairway to boot like heaven.

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
DJ Earworm on the source code.

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Is anybody home?

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Well, you don't know me.

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
But I don't know you.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
But I don't know you.

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600

131
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Feeling my rooms

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
One hour too bust

133
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
And my spirit is crying

134
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Pouring in

135
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Then my thoughts arise

136
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
brings a small duet dream

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,600
And before I see the ghost, I'll see the pain

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Because of where it's gone

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,600
I know it's mine

140
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,600
In the city

141
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,600
This is just a feeling

142
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,600
This is just a feeling

143
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,600
It's just a moment

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,600
If we all call the time, then the fight will lead us

145
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,600
And the mood will go

146
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,600
With those who stand on, and before it will come

147
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600

Yes, it's a feeling

154
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
We'll fight for another moment

155
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
This is just a time change

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,600
If we all call the time, then the fight will lead us

157
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
What makes me want to know?

158
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,600
It's just a moment

159
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,600

Love it fantastic

513
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
There was one more thing I wanted to say about the mashup

514
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
The stairway to Put Like Heaven

515
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,080
part and fascinates me.

516
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,880
She always has, and it's not just her appearance, but it's her whole background, you know,

517
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,760
this growing up in a hut, and playing with sticks most of her childhood, and then becoming

518
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,720
a big country in western star, and I saw this documentary, I don't know, and the living

519
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,040
UK channel or something, and I just blown away again by stuff she's done, you know, in

520
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,640
the past, she's given all the songs that she wrote with her partner, manager, she gave

521
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,840
them all back to him, all the licensing, everything, and you never hear about her with

522
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
anyone, do you?

523
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,320
You never hear about her love life, although in this documentary I saw, they did say that,

524
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,000
well, she actually said that in the early days she was, quote, very sexually active, and

525
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm just wondering, you know, what, who was she done with, fascinating, just a very amazing

526
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,400
woman that is, let's see, what we're also going to talk about this, there's lots of stuff,

527
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,800
oh, we talked about on Friday, and thank you very much for responding over the weekend,

528
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,680
and the email is still rolling in, of course, the ACing Croni is nature of podcasting,

529
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:55,240
people consume the podcast a lot later than they're created often, and I posed the question,

530
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,840
you know, would you be interested in getting free hosting and bandwidth for whatever you,

531
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,720
whatever your podcast needs are in return for advertising, and you know what, not a single

532
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,680
negative comment. In fact, overwhelmingly positive, though there is, I'm learning some stuff here

533
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,400
about if we want to put a model like that together, what I'm learning is that people definitely

534
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,640
want to be able to choose what kind of advertising, and that ranges from, you know, I want

535
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,400
to be appropriate to my audience, okay, that makes a lot of sense, by the way, and people aren't

536
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,800
looking for spots, I'm not necessarily talking about, you know, spot advertising, but more like,

537
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,360
this podcast brought to you by, I think that's probably a good dip in the, you know, toe dip in the

538
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,720
water, but mainly people are concerned that, you know, they wouldn't have a, well, she's have some

539
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,320
kind of sex products show up as advertising in or around their podcast, so that makes it a little

540
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,760
bit more complicated, I certainly understand, it makes a lot of sense, so I guess there is some categorization

541
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:01,080
to be done, but everyone seems to kind of like the idea, so I guess we can still, you know,

542
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:10,200
we can still figure out ways to trade beads and murals. I'm tired, I tell you, I took a lot of

543
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,400
Adam, big night in the big city, everybody, I'm getting old, I'm actually going to be 41,

544
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,840
this coming September, September 3rd. Was this, I wrote something down here, oh yeah, this is cool,

545
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,360
my in-laws are here, I told you that, we picked them up on Saturday, and my father-in-law is,

546
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,960
he's like a fucking magician with his hands, now he's a musician, and he writes musical scores,

547
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,520
literally just from his head, and anyone who does that knows that that's pretty complicated stuff,

548
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,080
and you can do 12 piece orchestrations, just right on paper, and he's actually, he's sitting,

549
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,640
he's got a keyboard here, and he's, you know, composing stuff, and God knows what,

550
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,480
but he can also take, you know, match sticks and some gaffa tape and glue and create a fireplace,

551
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,320
you know, he's amazing like that, Patricia has a lot of those qualities too, and so I was talking

552
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,920
to him about the desk that we talked about, you know, I want to have a better place, because I

553
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,920
like standing when I'm doing my, I like just standing in general when I'm working,

554
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:17,000
I wouldn't mind having a working area where I could have my, my rack with my equipment, my mixer,

555
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,600
my power book, you know, kind of in a little more ergonomic configuration, and he's already drawn

556
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,880
it up, he's already got the blue print done with a nice little rounded edge, so it kind of fit my

557
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,520
stomach into it, and belly up to the, to the workspace, as it were, and tomorrow we're going to go get

558
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,800
wood, and it's going to build this while I'm vacation, this guy's phenomenal, so I'll be sure

559
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,880
to actually I should take pictures of the entire process, because what he's going to do,

560
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,400
I'll ask him to take some pictures, we can get the wood tomorrow, we've got the blue print,

561
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,120
and he's going to build it in the garage, and then we come back, then Patricia of course has to

562
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,000
okay it, because it is a piece of furniture, you know, and then we'll move, I have to empty like

563
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,760
8 million draws on the thing I'm using currently, and God knows we're going to put that stuff,

564
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,040
and then we'll move that to the garage and move the new thing in, and it's going to be really

565
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,160
exciting, so looking forward to that, and pod save music coming up, which will be pod safe, but not

566
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:16,680
necessarily works safe, so you are for warned. Good morning, CC. This is Dave Hamilton from the Mac

567
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,400
Observer's Mac Geekab, and okay actually I have to set that up, that was that was stupid of me.

568
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,920
This was a voice response that was sent to CC Chapman of the accident hash, and I was copied on it,

569
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,360
and I was so blown away by this story that I really wanted you to hear it, because it is about

570
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,560
pod save music, let me just go up one level here, let me roll that out for you again, so we'll

571
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,200
he'll introduce himself, and you'll hear this story, but this is Dave Hamilton. Good morning, CC.

572
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:50,200
This is Dave Hamilton from the Mac Observer's Mac Geekab, and no, I'm not here to plug my own podcast,

573
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:57,800
though, my PR guy would yell at me if I didn't. I'm here to tell you as a quick story as quickly as I

574
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:05,720
can anyway, that I just think is freaking awesome. Last night, my wife and I went to see now is now

575
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:13,000
here in Durham, New Hampshire. Now we just moved up here from Connecticut, and my wife,

576
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,720
because she's my wife, started listening to podcasts a couple of months ago, and

577
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,000
her now is now bought a bunch of their CDs, listened to it, and our first date night out,

578
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,480
now that we're here in Durham, we got a babysitter last night, two of them, actually,

579
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,880
to watch two of our kids, hey, why not, support the local economy, and went and saw this band,

580
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,680
and they were, they're great. I mean, you know this, right? But these are guys, there's three

581
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,040
guys in this band, they produce a ton of music, and they just sound great, they leave it all

582
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,600
on the stage, they rock, right? They don't, they don't hold anything back, they're not here,

583
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,720
just to go through the motions, they rock, and it was just so awesome sitting there thinking,

584
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,000
man, none of this would have happened without podcasting. We never would have found this band.

585
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,960
We never would have gone into sports with last night to have a, you know, a night out,

586
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,000
and it was all because of podcasting. So I just wanted you to know that, you know, it's

587
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,880
come full circle, at least for us it here, it has one, one family at a time, right? So, you know,

588
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,800
it would start it out, it's just something listening to in the car and checking out this new

589
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,720
technology, has now infiltrated our lives to the point where it's, it's helping to decide a

590
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,560
direction for us in our leisure time, and it obviously, that's exactly what it's supposed to do,

591
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:43,320
but I wanted you to know that it's working. So, pre-chon brother, rock-on, have a great morning.

592
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,760
So, how cool is that? This is exactly what I'd hope would happen, and it is indeed working.

593
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,400
We are picking up on new music, we're creating new superstars, our own superstars, and that's

594
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,200
not necessarily, you're going to be millions and millions of sales and records, but I think

595
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,880
we'll be able to make some good beer and rent money, you know, and I'll take that as a start,

596
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:10,040
and the growth rate over at the Poncec Music Network is unbelievable. We're approaching a thousand

597
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,720
artists now, we've got a thousand podcasts, and a thousand and close to a thousand songs that have

598
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,600
been downloaded of the catalog that is. So it's just unbelievable what's happening, and I think

599
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,080
we're getting the store together so that anyone listed on the Poncec Music Network itself

600
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,880
to the Poncec Music Network is going to be very cool. Okay, I warned you earlier about the content

601
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,720
of the Poncec Music for this particular episode of the Daily Source Code, but it's not, you know,

602
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,520
the mood on that, but, you know, it is still kind of the beginning of the week, so it might apply to you.

603
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:05,960
I can't pay the rent and my pockets are empty, but you box reminds me of all the songs I

604
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:20,520
lose when I'm too busy and while I'm in the blue, everything is so fucked up, everything is so fucked up,

605
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:32,440
bittersweet is bittersweet, and even your memories are a memory, with someone banned the

606
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:48,760
other drink, with someone banned me another whiskey, everything is so fucked up, everything is so fucked up,

607
00:26:48,840 --> 00:27:02,200
and someone asked what you've been down, nothing is all I could say, it's hard to do much when

608
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:27,560
I'm always in pain, just getting awake the next day, every song already had its turn,

609
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:36,440
I hate music, that's a whole masterpiece, you think it's fun to be 31 and have ambition,

610
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:49,400
not the bullets for the gun, everything is so fucked up, everything is so fucked up,

611
00:27:49,720 --> 00:28:02,760
everything is so fucked up, my fingers just ran, I love,

612
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:13,240
gentry bronze and then the night watchman from San Francisco, everything is so fucked up,

613
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,760
you know if you're listening to the source code in the evening, it's perfect, you know, I've got the

614
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,080
lights dimmed and I've played that Daldy Parton song and now kind of this lounge,

615
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,160
piano, bluesy, type jazzy stuff, which reminded me of the last night after the party,

616
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,840
Patricia and I went to the hotel bar and it was a very, very chic, very classy bar and there was

617
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,080
a guy in there, just playing the complete Vegas repertoire, you know, like Moonlight in Vermont,

618
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,040
they didn't stop and actually it was interesting, we were sitting there actually having a late night

619
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,720
snack and the Liam Neeson walks in, so we had a real close encounter with a major superstar, he was hammered

620
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,200
by the way, I don't know if he was in town doing some work or apparently he's a regular at the hotel,

621
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:07,240
is it just me or was there like some kind of meeting where Germany and England and France and the

622
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,360
US all sat together and the world leaders said, hey let's go out and tell the world that Iran is

623
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,240
doing nasty shit and then I watched the news on television about them doing something that could

624
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:24,040
give them apparently some kind of enriched uranium, which would allow them to create nuclear power,

625
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:30,920
which of course immediately is thought to be a nuclear bomb, but then yeah, the pictures that you see

626
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:37,080
just don't correspond with what they're saying, you know, you see like power plants and then

627
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,240
like a Google Maps picture zooming in on a couple of barracks, I don't know, I'm quite sure I'm

628
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,440
understanding what's going on, maybe we're getting ramped up for something. A couple of days ago,

629
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,520
I posted something on my weblog at curry.com, the actually wind commander William wanted to know

630
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:04,680
what the origin of the English phrase, Tutal Pipp, Tutal Pipp, and what the origin of that was,

631
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:11,080
and I thought it was Tutal Pipp with a D, and I guess it was it's Tutal Pipp with a T, and there's

632
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:19,640
no real, you know, defined source of authority on this, but some say it's a derivative of Tutal

633
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:27,960
Lure, which is a French kind of like a sea later, and it morphed over time to Tutal Pipp.

634
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:35,640
Some also attributed to the sound that horns made on cars in the early 1900s. Well, Tutal Pipp,

635
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:42,280
I guess that's it. Thank you very much. It seems to be no definitive answer to that.

636
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:51,400
By the way, I've been talking to a lot of people about this lately, about living in the United

637
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:58,360
Kingdom as an American. Now, I guess we all are kind of like chameleons, you know, and you kind of

638
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:05,320
adapt to your surroundings, and we lived in Belgium in the castle. Now, the Belgian speak Flemish,

639
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,440
which is at least the part where we live, either they speak French or Flemish.

640
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:15,080
And the Flemish speaking part of Belgium, it's the Flemish is Dutch, only it's with an accent,

641
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,280
you know, it's southern, and words and phrases are differently, somewhere it's a completely

642
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,560
different, some phrasiologies, you know, and really it's more like a rhythm of the way they speak as well.

643
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,280
And when you're surrounded by, you know, a culture and people in language the whole time,

644
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,400
you start to pick it up and you start to incorporate it into your own speech.

645
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,040
And I'm really afraid to do that over here. I think I've talked about this before,

646
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,080
because everybody, every Brit here, when you say Madonna, they roll their eyes up and they're

647
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,000
heading, go, oh God, you know, she's trying to be so posh and posh and she's trying to,

648
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,280
it's your accent, it's just horrible. And then I think, you know, and I, because I was reminded

649
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,960
this, I saw Madonna's in the Vogue over here with the pictures of her country estate and her

650
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,640
and the kids and they're really great pictures and she's really, um, she's wearing kind of

651
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:13,000
classic almost 1930s clothes and she's beautiful that way. She really looks pretty and it suits her

652
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,800
extremely well and then she's in bed with Blu-Pajamas and the kids from Blu-Pajamas and it's all

653
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:23,480
just really nice. And I think, you know, I know our little bit, I've met her a couple times.

654
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,640
I think that she really just wants to fit in and she really enjoys the United Kingdom and of

655
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,680
course we're here. I understand, you know, why? And I see all the benefits and the stuff that she likes

656
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:40,360
but it's so unfair, um, because she's, she's really, she lets herself be assimilated and she's

657
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,440
taken that step and she said, okay, I'm just going to go with the flow of my accents here and it's

658
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:51,160
and, you know, and she kind of slides in and out of it but it's really, um, speaking English, speaking

659
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:57,560
proper English is, it's almost more of an attitude and it's more like, you know, the whole rhythm

660
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,800
of the speech, you know, you're much more careful about the words you use and the phrase

661
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,640
theology and your whole vocabulary kind of expands and certain long words that we would skip over

662
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:15,480
in America, um, are still, you know, utilized here and it really shows, um, uh, a different kind of,

663
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,880
um, I'm not going to, I can't look at my finger on it but it's more than just an accent.

664
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,840
There's, there's an attitude to it that you kind of take on and that may be it that there's some

665
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,200
offense to that, but anyway, um, a plea to all you brits out there, you know, let, let us yanks

666
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,880
slide a little bit, you know, we, we really want to try and blend in. We're here, we're here to learn

667
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,760
we mean you know hard. Oh yeah, oh yeah, we'll hide everybody. This is Dr. Puff.

668
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:55,640
I'm the host of a Reggae and Dub podcast called Pumpcast. Here's a testimonial from

669
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,480
Drew Domkis of the Don and Drew Show. Man, I just wish somebody would do a Reggae podcast.

670
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,080
I sure enough, this guy's going to do a podcast, which is all Reggae and, uh, it's just great, you know,

671
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,560
I mean, if you're in the Reggae, that show is just awesome.

672
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:19,400
Each show, we try to feature the best pod save Reggae and Dub out there and we try to create a

673
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,080
relaxing groove, maybe the perfect thing for that post daily source code lighter flick.

674
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:38,200
So subscribe through our RSS feed at the website puffcast.com or we're also in the iTunes music store.

675
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,480
P-E-U-F-F-C-A-S-T. That's Puffcast.

676
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:55,240
Special thanks to Don and Drew to Rob at podcast 4 and one of that little interview's

677
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,440
snippet. And, uh, and special thanks to you at him for the inspiration for Puffcasting in general.

678
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,720
Reggae and Dub all mixed up with my own homemade electronica.

679
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Oh, guys, Steve, Irene.

680
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,200
Yeah, Irene, I can't wait to go back to Jamaica. I think I've been 15 times in Jamaica. I love it.

681
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,800
And there's a virgin flight that goes direct. Okay, that'll be, that'll be, that'll be,

682
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,440
we'll do that in the winter when it's a shitty weather and we have some more vacation time coming up.

683
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,120
It's a daily source code. Let's, um, Y'am Polite is really busy actually.

684
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,800
Yeah, got a note from today that, um, hit test number 51 is on its way, but it looks like he's got, uh,

685
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,560
he's got a gig and he's got some stuff going on there in the Netherlands and I'm not

686
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,920
allowed to talk about it, but as soon as some news is known, I think it's very exciting and I definitely

687
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,320
want to young to come on the show and talk about it because it is something that's evolved out

688
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:53,240
of podcasting. Um, but I got your fix of trivia stuff. Backtracks podcast. So you think you know

689
00:35:53,320 --> 00:36:01,000
your hits backwards and forwards. Yeah, right. You're listening to the

690
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,360
backtracks podcast exclusively on the daily source code without I'm curry. Hey, Adam.

691
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,000
Hey, how you do? Let's get right into this week's quiz. All right. Listeners ready?

692
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,880
I'm ready. Are you ready, Adam? Yeah, I'm ready. Okay, here we go.

693
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
That's number one.

694
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,200
Yeah, I know what it is. This is uh, uh, who's Johnny Eldebard.

695
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,440
Time's up. Number two.

696
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:49,400
It's the same rhythm, uh, tempted by squeeze. That was interesting.

697
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,840
So four number three.

698
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,680
Something really heavy.

699
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Either I don't know the song or no.

700
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,200
Time's up. Okay, here the answer. Okay. Number one is a prize.

701
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:16,840
There you go.

702
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,160
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Johnny Eldebard.

703
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,600
And here's number two.

704
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,320
I love that song. That's right. It's tempted.

705
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,320
Number three.

706
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,600
I love that song.

707
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,520
What the hell is this?

708
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,280
Like Ronnie James D. Or something.

709
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
You got another thing coming.

710
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,240
I would not have guessed that one.

711
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,760
So how did you do Adam?

712
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,600
Uh, two out of three. It's my standard fair.

713
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,400
Thanks for joining us on this week's Backtracks podcast quiz.

714
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,040
You can visit Backtracks podcast on the web at

715
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,800
Backtrackspodcast.com.

716
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,000
You can catch it next time.

717
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,440
Backtracks podcast. Spin it back.

718
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,040
Man, that is just such a wall of sound.

719
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,840
It was a good time right here that I love the production.

720
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,200
All right, that's it for the source code.

721
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,600
Almost up to our 40 minutes for August 2nd.

722
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,480
Thank you very much for tuning in.

723
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,240
Sorry, I was so late with the show today.

724
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:43,240
So tomorrow, I should have time to either get it all done or at least start working on

725
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,280
a major portion of the Playboy Party sound scene tour.

726
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,880
So look forward to that.

727
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,720
I've got a little mellow or day.

728
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,240
Not as many phone calls as today.

729
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,440
Seems like there's another wave of press coming around as well.

730
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,920
So uh, beyond the lookout, be a look at an email if you have your own podcast.

731
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,000
Because that's the best way to get it out.

732
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,600
And I guess the press are back for more.

733
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,000
So, now they're looking for angles.

734
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,680
I have another angle on this podcasting phenomenon.

735
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,880
All right, it's Adam and Curry.com.

736
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,400
As you can send me audio feedback.

737
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,600
I'm still kind of staying ahead of my Gmail.

738
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,560
I deleted a couple of attachment-based emails and I'm done like 96%

739
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,240
so send it anything if you got it.

740
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:35,400
www.curry.com is my weblog.

741
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,160
We can always find a source code posting and also other stuff.

742
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,960
And daily source code.com for the podcast feeds of this particular podcast.

743
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,440
And if you have a side by radio receiver, stick it in your ear.

744
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,280
Man, I'm so ready for vacation.

745
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,520
And I gotta go line everybody up.

746
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,360
I actually, I gotta copy Doug right now.

747
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,840
I gotta tell him that we have all these villains coming next week.

748
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,880
Thank you very much for listening.

749
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
Wasting your time with me.

750
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,120
Stay subscribed. Bye-bye.

751
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,080
Another pod show podcast.

752
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,440
Stick it in your ear.
