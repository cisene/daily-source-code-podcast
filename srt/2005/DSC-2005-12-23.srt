1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,440
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,000
radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,600
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:36,960
Since a share of Charlie 3-0-4, I've got this pot show, breaking out a fat sack of the good

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,140
stuff.

6
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,260
I've got some

7
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,860
Oh, I feel so dead and saved

8
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,460
I can't attend when I can't find out where I hide

9
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,760
I need a remedy

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,060
From this calamity

11
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,560
Somebody tell me if I'm fine

12
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,060
If I really want to shine

13
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,560
If I really want to shine

14
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
I don't think that I can find

15
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
The song that's true in my heart

16
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,560
If I really shine

17
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,060
This is a cold

18
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,060
On the time

19
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,060
Like keep on making up reasons

20
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Why just can't find the right

21
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,060
Oh, I know something's got to kill

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,060
The song found deep down inside of me

23
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,060
That's the dying just to live

24
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,060
I feel it on my skin

25
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,060
I feel it right now

26
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,060
When we inhale, I feel the pain

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,060
Go tell me if I really want to shine

28
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,060
Oh, if I really want to shine

29
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,060
If I really want to shine

30
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,060
If I really want to shine

31
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:10,060
If I really want to shine

32
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:20,060
I'm sick and tired of holding out on me all the time

33
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,060
I'm waiting for the day when I can't be

34
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:45,060
I'm on a shine

35
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,060
Cause I really want to shine

36
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:58,060
Oh, if I really want to shine

37
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,060
This is a cold on the end of my life

38
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:11,060
The song found deep down inside of me all the time

39
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,060
Like keep on making up reasons

40
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,060
Why just can't find the right

41
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,060
Cause I really want to shine

42
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:31,060
When I can't shine

43
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,060
When I can't shine

44
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,060
Oh, if I really want to shine

45
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,060
I'd put this up right there with the love

46
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
Kevin Reeves, shine

47
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,060
Hey everybody, it's Friday

48
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,060
It's December 23rd

49
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,060
It's going to be a free wheelen kind of show

50
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,060
Since there's no satellite broadcast

51
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,060
So it's just us amongst ourselves here

52
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,060
No one else is listening in

53
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,060
I'm really getting into this whole vibe of

54
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Beyond just the pod save music network

55
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Now the social network is starting to connect

56
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,060
So slow sent, you know, slow, right?

57
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,060
He wrote that co-wrote and produced

58
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,060
If every day we're Christmas

59
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,060
Pod save for peace, fantastic project

60
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,060
Which I'm going to play later on this show as well

61
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
He sent me an email

62
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,060
After I played Kevin Reeves yesterday on the show

63
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,060
And he says, well, of course, you'll recognize that Kevin

64
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Sing several lines in pod save for peace

65
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,060
By the way, Kevin's album was the project I was working on

66
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,060
When I dropped everything to re-record

67
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,060
If every day we're Christmas for pod save for peace

68
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,060
Now that P for P stuff is settling down

69
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,060
I really wanted to finish shine for Kevin to have

70
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,060
Available for Christmas and glad you liked it

71
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060
Trying to get the rest of it done for me

72
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,060
January. Now, slow didn't ping me about this at all

73
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,060
I found this through those emails

74
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
That I told you about that I received from

75
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,060
Another podcast from the audience of this other podcast

76
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,060
So here's how the social network start to connect

77
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,060
From what was it? The podcast is called No Holds Bar

78
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,060
So I got a message from

79
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,060
What is it? Fibreo

80
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,060
Fibreo? Does that sound right?

81
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,060
Fox start India Bravo Romeo Alpha India Oscar

82
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,060
I'm the host of No Holds Bar radio

83
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,060
Well, one of them just heard yeah, I subscribed to haven't listened to it

84
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,060
And of course he says I just heard the show you mentioned us

85
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,060
And I'm grateful for the mention yeah, the show is three hours long

86
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,060
I know it's tough to get into but well worth it

87
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,060
Of course he says I know him a bit biased

88
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,060
It's not a college radio show though

89
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,060
That's what I thought it was so I was wrong

90
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
We are one of eight shows on a network that I started

91
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,060
That broadcast on the internet

92
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,060
I think they've been doing it for about six years

93
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
That's NHBradio.com

94
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,060
Kevin Reeves the guy who wrote Shine is a member of our staff and a cohost

95
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
Of one of the other shows

96
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,060
So now another network has formed right before my very eyes

97
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,060
Because it turns out that

98
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,060
Well, SLOW is legally blind

99
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,060
I think Kevin Reeves is also blind

100
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,060
And if I'm not mistaken

101
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,060
There's also another guy in No Holds Bar radio

102
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,060
Who's blind? I don't know

103
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,060
And I feel left out got damaged

104
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,060
But it's so cool how you know you're interfacing with people and finding people

105
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,060
And the internet is just a magical place

106
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,060
Isn't it shit just kind of bubbles up the stuff that you're looking for

107
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,060
It's just it kind of appears and people send you stuff

108
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
And it works it works it works it works it works it works

109
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,060
Let's celebrate that today

110
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,060
Loving it so now we just got to get the pod save music network more accessible

111
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,060
I know I know Chris Rockwell is all over it

112
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Oh man we've got so many things going on there

113
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
Well we've been working on on

114
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,060
Oh you know I'll say that for let me see

115
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Well actually have a whole

116
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,060
PDN PM in thing I want to talk about

117
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
I'll talk more about the pod take music network later first

118
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
Yesterday I was home

119
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,060
What was I doing I was I was like conference calls

120
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,060
And we're just doing regular like office guy stuff

121
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,060
And the Patricia comes in I can see on her face

122
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
That you know something's up

123
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,060
I think I was on with Ron I said well hold on a second

124
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
And I said when you know what's going on you say well

125
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Dad just had a minor stroke

126
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,060
Oh man when it rains it pours

127
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,060
He's okay

128
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,060
They call it a Tia

129
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,060
As in tango india alfa

130
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,060
Which I'm not quite sure what it stands for but it's like a miniature aneurysm

131
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,060
So maybe the A is for aneurysm

132
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,060
Apparently he keeled over while sitting behind this computer of course

133
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
That's my destiny

134
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,980
This is not the first time he's had a

135
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Had one of these he had another one

136
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,980
About six months ago so there are all kinds of warning signs of shit going wrong

137
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,980
My dad and I don't have the best of

138
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Relationships in fact we've barely spoken for years

139
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
Maybe an email or a phone call or something

140
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,980
But we you know this just a connection problem there which is

141
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,980
This I don't I think the source code is not in the place to get into that

142
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,980
But oh man how fucking weird is it?

143
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
You know

144
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
So soul searching to do here on this side

145
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:04,700
Okay, so anyway, I still want to celebrate all the great things the internet has brought us on this a beautiful Friday

146
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,460
Who did I see I got a remember I played Sean more Malo?

147
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,820
Yeah, I think the I mean more Malo. Yeah, that's the way you pronounce it

148
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,980
So I got an email from Laura

149
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,980
Let me see I think Laura is what did she do

150
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
Let's read the email here

151
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:32,980
I wanted to let you know the Sean more Malo I was seeing Sean she says has seen a substantial increase in sales since uploading is music to the pod sake music now working

152
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,980
August sales reports come through CD baby dot com or delayed so sales that were completed in October

153
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Sean is just starting to get sales reports and payments for now. You played Sean on November 18

154
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,980
So I'm curious to see the impact of that

155
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,980
And then she says PM into where I would be down for that struggle

156
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,980
I think that we'll be doing all kinds of cool. You know what this is the time to talk about the pod sake music network. So here's

157
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,980
Here's the thing that

158
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,980
That we're working on so you know that we're we're implementing a payment system

159
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,980
Hold on a second

160
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,980
You know Sean sent me this. I'm on as we'll do this. Hey, this is Sean more Malo and you're listening to the daily source code with the pod

161
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,980
Adam Curry. All right, more Malo. Sorry about that Sean but you did again

162
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Okay, so we're implementing

163
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,980
Commerce on the pod sake music network. Now there's the traditional way you go, which is with a credit card or PayPal or combination

164
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,980
There are you know we have you basically select whatever payment credentials you want to put in

165
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:36,980
But what I've really been all over and what I think is the right way to go looking at the audience from music and for the the impulse buy of this purchase

166
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,980
Is to do it through SMS very much. You know text messaging is what it's called in the states the rest of the world calls it SMS

167
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
It's just like when you vote for American Idol

168
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,980
You cast your vote you send a text message to a certain number with the with the number of your favorite potential idol

169
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:05,980
And it cost you like 99 cents. Well, duh. Hey, wait a minute. It gets charged right to your phone bill. This is fantastic because this way you don't lock out just so many people who

170
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Aren't able to put down a credit card particularly kids and kids like to buy music. You know, does it make any sense that

171
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:20,980
If you have to have a credit card to buy music on the iTunes music store and you can't get that from your parents. I'm not given my daughter my credit card

172
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,980
And my iTunes music account no way. Yeah, I can gift her stuff sure, but you know no way just no way

173
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:35,980
But every kid has a cell phone and every kid, you know loves to buy music and they want to buy music if they can't then what's the logical response

174
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,980
They're going to go rip it off from somewhere duh

175
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,980
So they do like the ease of use now the problem with this almost second. I have a lovely cup of sense say I'll brew it up here for me

176
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Hmm

177
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
The problem with this

178
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Is that

179
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,980
The carriers the phone companies like Verizon and

180
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,980
Team mobile and you know all the cellular carriers

181
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
They take

182
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,980
45 to 50 percent of the money

183
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,980
So if you were to charge 99 cents per song

184
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,980
Almost half of it goes to the carriers right away now of course that is negotiable if you know if we have like American idol like

185
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,980
Traffic happening. I'm sure that we can negotiate that down, but that's basically what it would start off with so

186
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,980
You know, I know there's lots of people who are very smart listening to this show

187
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,980
And if you have any information about getting a better deal or

188
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Just any I don't think it's there. I mean, this is really the monopoly of the

189
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,980
Cell phone carriers

190
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:45,980
And that's probably just the only way we can go. I mean, I can see maybe doing a double offering where if you want you can

191
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Pay with a credit card and then we'll make sure that the balance goes to the artist

192
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:58,980
So you know obviously pod show needs to take some money for the for the processing, but I'm looking more like what CD baby does

193
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,980
You know, they seem to do a pretty fair deal. So I think

194
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,980
If it all works, then we all make out because we'll do it on humongous volume. It'll be beautiful

195
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,980
But so the question is, you know, do we also offer an alternative to buy for 99 cents knowing that

196
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Basically everyone gets ripped off in the process by the cell phone carrier and I have to say

197
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,980
You know, there is a lot going on on their end. There's the whole processing. They're deducting it from a phone bill

198
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,980
And you're doing, you know, they are doing some stuff there, but at the end of the day, it's software that's just running and you're just being overcharged for it

199
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,980
Really how long until their investment is out or they can pull their investment out or they just using perhaps their monopoly position

200
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,980
But personally, I think that we should offer offer it two ways. I'd love to hear your feedback on that

201
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,980
Because I love the ease of use of text messaging, but you know, really hate the fees that are just being taken away

202
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,980
So there you go. Okay, onward with the show

203
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:04,980
I'd asked many of you to recommend songs to me that of course is how I came across Kevin Reeves and got an email here from deliberate noise

204
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Better known as Derek as a musician from Detroit called Nadir

205
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:20,980
And the song I dig is called Slave and Derek sent me a link to Nadir's page on the pod save music network

206
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Which of course we'll put into the show notes, not I personally, but you will

207
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,980
And I checked it out and you know what dude, I told you like

208
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Well, don't you know I want to live again

209
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
Like a man, it's supposed to

210
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Now I don't want to be a slave anymore

211
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,980
And I don't want to be a slave for you

212
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,980
The Santa American Trudgery

213
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,980
And don't you know that it's a crime

214
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
All the steps in the wheel

215
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,980
Who did a sweet tease of joy and pain?

216
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Don't give a damn about the good time

217
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Because we're making so hard to fail

218
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
But you're looking for another river

219
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,980
Now I'm alone in my despair

220
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
And I just get a record

221
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
But take you turn the key

222
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
And I'll make you in this corner

223
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,980
And let's break it

224
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
I'll never be here

225
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
I don't want to feel the pain in my home

226
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,980
And I don't want to feel the whip across my spine

227
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
So I want to be tough

228
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
Can't tell you

229
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,980
Change your love inside

230
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
But don't you know I want to live again

231
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,980
Like a man, it's supposed to

232
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,980
And I don't want to be a slave anymore

233
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,980
And I don't want to be a slave for you

234
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,980
And you will mother something who could be there

235
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,980
And I heal, heal, heal

236
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,980
She's got me like a crazy blade

237
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,980
And still, I can't get over you

238
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,980
And remember when you're far away

239
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,980
I keep remembering your sweet perfume

240
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Instead of thinking about the look

241
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,980
You used to make I'm a vulnerable

242
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
And I'll pick you through

243
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
And I can still record

244
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
But take you turn the key

245
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,980
And let's break it

246
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,980
And I don't want to feel the pain in my home

247
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,980
And I don't want to feel the whip across my spine

248
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
So I want to be tough

249
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
Can't tell you

250
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
To change your love inside

251
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,980
But don't you know I want to live again

252
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
And I can manage it, supposed to

253
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,980
And I don't want to be a slave anymore

254
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,980
And I don't want to be a slave for you

255
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,980
And I can still record the pain in my home

256
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,980
And I can still record the pain in my home

257
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,980
And I don't want to feel the whip across my spine

258
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
And I don't want to feel the whip across my spine

259
00:17:48,980 --> 00:18:18,980
There's no discrepancy, I'm let the pain in yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

260
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:41,140
okay yeah okay okay so I'm so officially a Patricia approved she walked in and then uh

261
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:47,940
Blair in a way on the speakers and she went, yeah, there you go, Nadir. I don't want to be

262
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:54,260
slaved to you from his distorted soul to point OCD from the Podsate Music Network.

263
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,900
Just staying on the PMN for a second, Adrina Thorpe, who you know from Fly Fly Fly,

264
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,180
which I played the other day on the show, said Adam, thank you for playing my songs

265
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,420
from time to time. The whole pod thing is crazy cool. I just put my stuff up here

266
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,100
up there on Podsate. Next thing I knew I was getting played all over on on your show,

267
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,340
which I know is massively downloaded on the daily basis. And I listened like, and then I can

268
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,140
see why she said, that's so nice. Thanks for playing me. And for that lovely intro, you gave

269
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,820
me. I said, the golden older of Podsate Music. That was hilarious. She says, who would have

270
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:33,660
thought. She sees that she says that she has seen a direct correlation between what she

271
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,580
called pod plays and sales. Although she notices something else that, and she talks about

272
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:47,660
download. So I'm going to say that's probably paid downloads from somewhere. The more the,

273
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,540
now, let me see if I can understand what she's saying here. It seems that less downloads on

274
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,700
the songs I offer on the Podsate Music Network than the ones that aren't there. If everybody

275
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,140
likes freebies, I'll probably take a few songs down from there. I have six up right now. I wonder,

276
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,260
I see, I think that as independent artists, Podsate artists become more and more,

277
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,820
their own little companies, their own record companies, essentially, because you have everything within

278
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,260
your power. We're going to see a lot more analysis done on what works and what doesn't work.

279
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,060
And so a dream is already thinking that way. I'm not quite sure what the correlation is. And if

280
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:33,340
maybe more tracks, oh man, it's not sale. Maybe more tracks on PMN leads to album sales,

281
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,780
the CD sales, and we got to get merchandise up there. It just, it doesn't stop. And also,

282
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:45,980
we really need to get some tools for independent artists to promote themselves to the pod

283
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,860
castors. I've been receiving a couple of emails, actually, from artists saying, hey, I think my song

284
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,860
will fit on your show. We listen to it, and they give me a link to the PMN, and it can link

285
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:04,140
right into my playlist. But there's no real uniform way that's being sent. There's no eye-catching

286
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,500
thing. We'd have four gigs of Gmail crap stored up here, and more and more piloting in every

287
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,940
single day. So maybe some tools there to promote it, because I go back to the simple numbers,

288
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,380
if you have a thousand podcasts, and that's only a tenth of what people claim there's out there

289
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:28,140
today, which is 10,000, although I'm sure we're around 15 to 20 now. If a tenth of that,

290
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,620
one thousand podcasts, with an average of a thousand listeners, plays your song within a week,

291
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,060
that's a million spins. That's unbelievable. You're going to sell off of that. There's just no

292
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,980
way that it just, that's, all the proof is right here. I love it. I love it. And thank you,

293
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,140
Adryna, for sending, for sending in that wonderful email. We'll talk a little bit more about

294
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,060
the blank media tax, and performance rights in other countries all on today's show.

295
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,300
Adam, under November 20th, I had the idea to do the Mad Money Machine podcast.

296
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,460
I got a microphone, a mixer, and audio software. Got the domain name. Learned how to set

297
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,540
up the blog and website and feed, wrote up the first show notes. I got some music from the

298
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,340
Podsake Music Network. I produced the show, the artwork, the ID3 tags, uploaded the show,

299
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:19,260
a notified various podcast directories. Well, by December 22nd, just 32 days since the idea first

300
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,380
flashed in my mind, my podcast has already made it to number 8 in the iTunes Business category,

301
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:31,500
32 days, and I'm in the top 10. Adam, just two words. Thank you. I started listening to your show

302
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,220
at about the SC197 and have a missed one since. You have most definitely been the inspiration

303
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,660
to do this, and I thank you. The Mad Money Machine podcast is simply about my passion

304
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,140
to help people invest wisely. Among other things, on each show I'll review the performance of

305
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,500
the stockpicks from CNBC's most watched show, Jim Crammer's Mad Money. The podcast also provides

306
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,420
lots of other investment insights and tools, including a special segment called new money,

307
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,180
at the end of the show for beginning investors or even kids. So check it out at madmoneymachine.com.

322
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:45,740
Yo, a guy growing bow. Thank you very much. Okay, let me just talk about advertising and podcast.

323
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:52,220
I know that you heard the Earth Link commercial zing by there, and we're really happy that Earth

324
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,940
Link is sponsoring actually pretty big portions of the pod show podcast network.

325
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,940
Just wanted to give you some grand vision, because of course, that's still a standard spot,

326
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:09,820
and it's a very standard radio-like way. Of course, if we wind up recreating radio, but leaving

327
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,220
advertising the same, then I think we've pretty much failed. There's still going to be a healthy

328
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,740
mix of the old school stuff where we figure all of this out, so I think that as we work together

329
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,060
on figuring out what works, but I do want, I just want to stop briefly and just let you know

330
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,300
what the grand vision of it is, and we've talked about this before, but I want to reiterate,

331
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:37,980
and the reason why I want to read, the reason why I want to reiterate that is because I heard

332
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,180
my partner Ron Bloom saying the same thing, and when I've known him for a long time, and when we

333
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,900
start saying the same thing, then we're on the right track, then we're working, and it goes,

334
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,420
it's not like any secret handshake or agreement, and it works vice versa.

335
00:25:52,540 --> 00:26:00,140
And I think the concept of winding up where actually, because remember, this is not if we recreate

336
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:06,460
radio, or the entertainment VM, I don't see the podcast as radio, because I know we'll talk about

337
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:12,220
that a bit in a second, but if we were to recreate it and we come right back to the way that

338
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:19,260
radio charges, namely the CPM, or the cost per mill, in other words, the dollar amount you pay

339
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:26,620
per thousand listeners reached, which is anywhere between five and twenty five dollars per

340
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:35,740
thousand people that you reach, those are radio prices these days, then we've failed as well.

341
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,100
So, you know, taking into account that even if you have 10 listeners, those listeners have

342
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:50,540
a special connection between themselves amongst themselves and the podcaster, or the podcasters,

343
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,820
or the host, or the producers of the show, and that connection is what we're out to prove

344
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:03,820
is extremely valuable, and it's our belief that we can manage advertising campaigns well enough

345
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,580
that the actual advertisers will have to audition in a number of ways, including price,

346
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:18,300
to actually be able to advertise on any given podcast. So, I just want that to set in for a second,

347
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,740
because that is what is, I believe, I really, truly believe is going to drive this new form of

348
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,820
advertising. We're going to work much more directly with the creative side of the advertising business

349
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,100
for instance, that these earthling spots, actually, if it was a different one every single time,

350
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,780
and I had 30 different ones and there was a different story, it would bother me much less.

351
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,700
I think repetition is the thing that is one of the things that we've gotten really tired of in mainstream

352
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:50,380
radio, and you can repeat the same general message, but it can be delivered different every single time.

353
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,700
That would just be a start, just a very small modification, and that's done all the time, by the way,

354
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:03,420
of course, in traditional advertising. But the concept that an advertiser would have to audition

355
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:13,740
to sponsor a show is big, and it opens it up so that not only big brands and big advertisers,

356
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,780
but if you wanted to just show up with your credit card and advertise on Dawn and Drew, as an example,

357
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,140
then you should be able to do that, and you should be able to audition in the same manner.

358
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:29,260
And I think at the end of the day, the show itself, the producers, and probably the audience,

359
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,260
if we find the right way to involve them, will ultimately decide what is applicable and what is not.

360
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,740
And that's pretty powerful stuff, it really is. So I just wanted to throw that out there.

361
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,660
Got some interesting Gmail feedback. You know, I'm up to 98% now, I'm my Gmail account. I receive

362
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:54,060
the special geeky four gigs instead of two gigs. I'm not seeing it grow, so I think it's a hard

363
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,700
wire change they made for me. So I'm going to have to start begging again to get more

364
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:05,900
gigage allocated. I pay for it. I gladly pay for it. I really love Gmail. Let me pay for it, please.

365
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:20,460
Give me more space. I need more space. Leo Vagoda has heard Maya

366
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,260
ranting about Gmail, and he started using it for his personal mail, and he likes the way

367
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,820
the built-in spell checker works. I totally agree. I use it all the time. It also has,

368
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,740
it seems a growing list of languages that it'll check for. In fact, when I write an email in

369
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,380
Dutch, which I also do from time to time, and I hit spell check, it automatically recognizes

370
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,340
that it's Dutch. I don't even have to set it. So that's really nice. Leo goes on to say in his emails,

371
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,620
I check the spelling on a mail I was sending earlier this evening. I noticed they don't know

372
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:52,700
the word podcast. It's true. I've noticed this. I have told Rama, she rommed that. I said,

373
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,820
dude, you know, next time we talk to the Gmail guys, get me some more space. And you might want

374
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:03,180
them to put the word podcast into their spell check dictionary. It's just a minor oversight,

375
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,220
but it makes you look so Microsofty, you know? So please fix that. They'll hear it. They'll fix it.

376
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,820
Let's keep an eye on it. From this date, from the 23rd December, let's see how long it takes to get

377
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:20,300
it fixed. And I lost his email address. Dutch guy sent me an idea about syncing up Gmail to my

378
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:26,220
blackberry, and using the email push the way the way it works with the regular service that it

379
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:32,060
comes with. And he has a very good work around. Unfortunately, speaking of Microsoft, it requires

380
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:39,740
installing the exchange server. So his idea was since, since Gmail, so I guess it supports I'm

381
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,620
app. Does it support I'm app? Yeah, I think it supports I'm app. Or maybe the extended pop three

382
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,340
protocol, whatever the hell that is. And what he did is, so essentially you can set up push email

383
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,220
either through your cellular carrier who will have some kind of web interface for you or you can

384
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:03,420
set it up with an enterprise exchange server. And it'll also push your email out and synchronize

385
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,940
it. And so what he did is he said, well, once you create a connector to Gmail through I map,

386
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,820
or the extended pop three protocol, so that it will basically replicate the changes that you make

387
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,540
in your exchange email box. And so it is a chain and there's an extra step in the middle,

388
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,580
but it would work. Now, of course, the the big problem is, you know, setting up an exchange

389
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:32,460
server. Man, I'm afraid of that. But the idea is really cool. So it could work. Any more thoughts

390
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,780
on that are obviously welcome. And just got a quick email from Cass Blaster Mike. We haven't talked

391
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,060
about Cass Blaster Mike in a while. He has been releasing new code steadily and he's been working

392
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:49,420
on this other thing, which he hasn't even given me a runtime copy of yet, which is it just looks

393
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,860
really cool. It's the other side of the equation. But it's what I like about seeing the kind of

394
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,980
development that Mike does is he's he's out to solve a problem. He's not, you know, just developing

395
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,100
software. He sees a problem. He saw the problem of a simple way to record a podcast. He fixed it.

396
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,700
And the ties are now being made. The connections between the cast Blaster software and the

397
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:16,540
PDN, the podcast delivery network. So that's going to be cool for direct, you know, one button

398
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:25,900
click it all fires off and you're done with that crap. He said that the, um, what is it? The forum

399
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:34,300
moderator over to castblaster.com has actually started his first podcast, which is unusual. Now usually

400
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:41,420
people who are on the listening side or, um, or the, you know, or really fans of shows or software.

401
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,700
They don't, you know, if they're not podcasting already, it doesn't happen that, you know,

402
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,060
people hang around for months and then start to podcast. And so he's got a, it doesn't have a promo yet,

403
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:57,420
but it's a radioqrm.com. If you want to hear a podcast made with cast Blaster, direct from the

404
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,100
cast Blaster community, really go check that out. And cast Blaster is a free download, um, it'll work

405
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,860
for, you know, it'll record up to 10 minutes and then you can purchase a license. If you want to,

406
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:13,100
uh, um, if you want the full understricted version, castblaster.com.

407
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:21,180
Oh, let me see. Well, I was just cruising around the podcast, using network, uh, and, you know,

408
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,700
again, another 50 new songs in there, so another record label came online, just kicking some

409
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,300
ass. And, um, I found this, uh, it's kind of like a mix, but it's like rock and a little bit of

410
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:43,420
country, uh, let me see, the artist's name is Terri Lee Cobble. And I think the CD's about a year old,

411
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,940
but, uh, yeah, I'm a sucker for this kind of music. White T-shirt on your daily source code.

412
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

413
00:34:32,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

414
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:09,300
My body now, my rugged warrior, you own this heart

415
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:18,300
I'll keep it for you, my life, my love, my rugged warrior

416
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:29,300
I love everything world, give me a life I take

417
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:39,300
You're the picture of adventure and you're the kind my name

418
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,300
My life now, my rugged warrior, you own this heart

419
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:09,300
I'll keep it for you, my life, my love, my rugged warrior, my life, my rugged warrior

420
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Yeah, I should look good too

421
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
Terrily bubble

422
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,300
My teacher, very short code, the Christmas edition isn't it?

423
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,300
I'm not going to do a show on Saturday, certainly not on Sunday

424
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
Patricia's present came today

425
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
I'm glad she isn't listening to the show

426
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,300
But thanks to all of your comments about what kind of karaoke machine to get her

427
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
Which I know is her big wish

428
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:43,300
And I got this fantastic, it's like the professional version of the version

429
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Version of the Mr. microphone

430
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,300
And it's got thousands of songs you can hook it up to the TV

431
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
It has a wireless FM transmitter

432
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
It's got to do it microphones

433
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
It's high, yeah

434
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,300
So the only thing I got to do now is get a good amplification radio reception system

435
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,300
But I'm really, really happy about what I got for

436
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
So this is the Christmas edition

437
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
I'm only halfway through the list

438
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,300
I don't know if I want to do another hour long show

439
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,300
It was Timothy Freewin

440
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,300
It says you add on my feel really offended about how you seem so incapable of keeping up with the lost info

441
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,300
And he sent me this list of lost podcasts

442
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
I'm talking about the TV series lost

443
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
That is so extensive

444
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,300
That once the show notes are up, I'll go in and I'll just post this whole list in

445
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Because it's every single thing you want to know about lost in the podcast format

446
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Which by the way, I'm starting to figure this out

447
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Really what we're talking about here is

448
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,300
We're mashing up our own media

449
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Yeah, it's a podcast, yeah, it's kind of like radio

450
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
But what is it really?

451
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,300
What really is this stuff we're doing?

452
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,300
What we're doing is we're taking each other's shit and repurposing it

453
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,300
And throwing good back at each other

454
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,300
It's like it's definitely mash up

455
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,300
We're mashing up songs that we're making in our bedrooms, basements, addicts

456
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Or professional studios

457
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,300
We're taking audio feedback from each other

458
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,300
And bits and bytes and pieces of mainstream media

459
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,300
That have been missed and mashed and mangled

460
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,300
And we're putting it all together and then we're calling it a podcast

461
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,300
But it's a mash, it's a mash of stuff

462
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
And I think that we're going to see

463
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Well, I think we'll see the same thing with video

464
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,300
Seems like and maybe with pictures we see all kinds of mashups

465
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,300
So the next thing I want to invent

466
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Is the mashboard

467
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,300
That's what it's got to be

468
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
It's got to be a mashboard

469
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,300
And it got to be able to output to different places and different devices

470
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,300
And it's the communication that we were talking about

471
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,300
The podsafe music community and which interweaves into podcast community

472
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,300
Which interweaves into yet other communities of a physical handicapsy

473
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,300
But you know, so you find yourself in touch with all these great people

474
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,300
And you know what it's

475
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,300
It's

476
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,300
Oh, man, what can I compare it with?

477
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,300
It's going to be the, you know, it's going to be big

478
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
I can feel it, I can't feel it

479
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Here's an example of all that mashing stuff

480
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
You know, when I was a young boy

481
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,300
They told me not to put my day job

482
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,300
Because my shinning shut

483
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
Well, you know what?

484
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
I'm a podcaster now

485
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,300
And because you've had a curry and podcaster

486
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,300
I can quit my day job

487
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,300
You can quit your day job

488
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,300
I can quit my home

489
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,300
You, why do you?

490
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
You, why do you?

491
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,500
Did you see the

492
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:03,300
All the new themes song when we talk about podекотор

493
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
Yesterday I put out of the challenge

494
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,300
Since we haven't officially announced

495
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,300
We have two partners. I'm only kind of hinted it one

496
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,300
For our podcast delivery network

497
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,300
Now the the big thing about

498
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Growth and podcasting

499
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:23,060
testing is this shit just eats up bandwidth and in order to be able to deliver reliably,

500
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:27,700
we didn't want to go and build infrastructure that other people had figured out a long,

501
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:35,660
long time ago. So we partnered up with a big player. And we want to make sure that, of

502
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:41,060
course, anyone who wants to independently produce a podcast, can at least not have to worry

503
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,980
about the delivery part, not have to worry about the tools part, not just not have to worry

504
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,180
about that stuff. So you can just get, hey, look, if you need to produce her, then that

505
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,340
works going to help you out, believe me. So I hinted around, and so far two people have gotten

506
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:00,260
the right Pico and Leo figured out who our partner is. So that's all I'm going to say about it

507
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,460
for right now. You could actually, if you did some more digging, and this is for the nerds,

508
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:13,300
you could actually find out who our other partner is. And it's also a really a network partner,

509
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,260
but someone who offers a very important service when it comes to networking.

510
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:27,220
And we think, January 1st, we'll have our first, by now it's probably about 50 podcasters

511
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:34,100
who will be using the PDN as well as the first portions of the network.

512
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,100
And I can tell you, I'm very, very excited about it. So, and they'll be talking about it on their

513
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,300
own shows, and they'll be letting you know about what they're experiencing. So I don't have to

514
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,060
to do our own horn here for the moment. But I do want to do the horn of the folks at Pod Show

515
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:57,940
who are working really hard to get a lot of stuff done before, really the Christmas week,

516
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,980
and also for those who have decided to shift their lives around to work between Christmas and New

517
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:13,060
years, and it's deeply appreciated by myself, and I'm sure that a whole bunch of other podcasts

518
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,740
who have been waiting for for great services to come online and to be happy as well.

519
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,660
Oh, wait a minute. Oh, yes, it's time, ladies and gentlemen, because it's Friday, so we get the

520
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,140
talk about the bio diesel industry, and we do it with a Trinity song.

521
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:43,780
From the bio diesel industry. So today we've got some banter on synthetic oils, some

522
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:50,260
biodiesel podcasts, a book about biodiesel, having some cow dung make a car run, and a show on the

523
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:58,980
discovery channel. It's also a diesel engine for an airplane, and is she a biodiesel at all?

524
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,300
These questions of many more will remain unanswered in our bio diesel segment.

525
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,020
Which of course revolves around the purchase of my new Mercedes 300 turbo diesel biodiesel?

526
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:36,180
Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, I think Jeff is blind too.

527
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:43,300
I don't know. Jeff, can you send me the, just the track for that? The music, because I'd love to

528
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,900
continue the music, continue to have the music continue underneath me going through some of the

529
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,580
feedback that we received regarding biodiesel and Trinity, and I'd really love for these to be

530
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,860
audio feedback, and one of the things we're going to have on a new show sites as a part of the

531
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,420
podcast network will be a feedback mechanism that'll make that a lot easier for everybody,

532
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:10,020
including the podcast, of course. Peter Warnock, hooked into the synthetic oils conversation

533
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,780
and says synthetic oils help reduce our dependency on crude oil, but it's still derived from petrochemicals

534
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:22,500
as our nylon latex plastic and a variety of other products. Yeah, okay. So, again, you know,

535
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:28,260
I'm not in this, I just want to make it clear, although it has all the benefits of being much greener away

536
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:35,700
of consuming road space. I'm really in it for the independence of just being able to, you know,

537
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:45,300
my ultimate dream to be able to poop in my tank and go. BJK, BJ says you need to serve to TDI club.com.

538
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,580
Okay, form for diesel owners, hackers, mechanics, biodiesel brewers. These are the guys who know

539
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:56,500
all about the diesel cars. Okay, definitely. And also he says the podcast more hip than hippie

540
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:02,820
had useful biodiesel information. Okay, so maybe we can ask Dorian Val to revisit biodiesel.

541
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:10,260
That would be cool. Moving on to Ash Reed, Adam Congratulations with your new car.

542
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:16,660
I've enclosed the book I sell over at newbiodiesel.com about biodiesel. Good starting point for making

543
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,700
and using biodiesel. Okay, cool. So that's newbiodiesel.com. I thank you for the PDF.

544
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:28,420
It's on my required reading list that usually happens on virgin upper class. And then I got an article

545
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:34,100
about cow fuel. I'm just going to fire up a fire Fox here for a second. Take it there.

546
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,500
It's actually a Reuters story. And this comes from Quebec. A Canadian company has an idea for

547
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,860
motors worried about global warming. Put a cow in your tank. And man, what's next? Poop in your

548
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:53,860
tank? You're going to steal all my lines here. $14 million a Canadian dollar. Factor in your

549
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,580
Montreal started producing biodiesel fuel two weeks ago from the bones, innards, and other parts

550
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:05,300
of farm animals such as cattle, pigs, or chickens that Canadians do not eat. We're rushing. No, I'm

551
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,180
sorry. We're using animal waste to reduce greenhouse gas emissions said marketing director won

552
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:16,020
Ron Wardrop of Rothsay, which runs the plant. We need more of this type of thing. And he said

553
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:21,060
at the plant by the St. Lawrence River near Montreal where 189 nations are meeting this week to

554
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:26,820
work out how to curb climate change, wildly blamed on emissions of heat-trapping gases from fossil

555
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:34,820
fuels. Anyway, so they're thrown just debris, I guess. Just dead, dead animals. Okay.

556
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:41,700
Which brings us back to that original thought of your granny and your tank. More with thought.

557
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:48,340
I missed it, but the discovery channel had a show called dirty, or has a show called dirty jobs.

558
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:53,220
And in one of the episodes they featured biodiesel, I was wondering if anyone has a bit torn

559
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,060
or can tell me when, because I do have discovery channel here over in Europe. I don't know if it's the

560
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:06,580
same one. Just when I can catch that. I'd love to see that. And here's Kevin Mason saying,

561
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,140
how about having listeners send you an image? Oh, this is whether I actually have a biodiesel

562
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,780
engine or not. I think we're going to find out if I have a biodiesel engine, we throw some biodiesel

563
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:22,260
in and see if it works or not. But that is a good idea. If someone could put in the show notes,

564
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,460
a converted engine before and after. So we know exactly what pieces of kit to look for. That would

565
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:36,020
be very helpful. And see two more here. John Foreman says, actually, oh, I know John,

566
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:41,540
he says he's been in the garage building as plain all week. And he's been catching up on the daily

567
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:50,020
source codes. And he sent me a link to a site called Delta Hawk and Delta Hawk Engines.com.

568
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:56,660
Um, they make diesel engines for airplanes. He says, doesn't know if they have a conversion

569
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:04,900
for the 182, but, you know, I'm sure it's coming. Imagine that flying, pooping in your planes tank.

570
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:11,620
Oh, man, I love it. And then the final one, Chris Holman, who, yeah, this is the same thing.

571
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,300
Other than the stick around the back windshield, or you sure this is even a biodiesel car.

572
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:21,060
Well, I'm going back at the January 8th, I think, the 8th or the 9th. And I'll be then in the

573
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:26,580
condo for two weeks, a good run. And, uh, well, I know that I'm going to run out of fuel eventually.

574
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:32,020
So we are going to do our sound seeing tour trip to Berkeley, biodiesel oasis.

575
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,860
Yeah, baby, cannot wait. Hey, Adam, this is Chris with the Children of the God's Project

576
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:42,580
over at Children of the Gods that net. I just wanted to drop you a line and thank you for playing

577
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:47,620
my comment to you on your show a couple of weeks back. And again, for the play on today's show as

578
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:53,620
well, I also wanted to pass on to you that the response to that comment has been simply phenomenal.

579
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,620
I've received close to 50 emails from folks offering to lend their voices or various

580
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:02,820
talents with music and sound effects to the project. I have to tell you, I'm truly scrambling to

581
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:07,300
get the scripts written fast enough to give as many of these great people a role in the project as

582
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:14,180
quickly as possible. It's getting a little nuts. In fact, for those of your listeners who have

583
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,900
set me an email and haven't received a response from me yet, I would like to apologize for the delay

584
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,100
and getting back with them. Simply, wasn't prepared for the onslaught on my inbox, and since I'm

585
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:29,940
pretty new, not only to podcasting, but also to a publicized project of this scope. I'm suffering

586
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,460
from a bit of disorganization. I've worked hard to fix it though, and I'd like to invite any of

587
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:41,060
the volunteers who have not heard back from me to visit production.children of the gods.net

588
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,620
and create an account for themselves. There, they can check out the latest scripts as they are finished

589
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:51,780
and see what roles are available and make contact with me to volunteer for a particular part.

590
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:57,060
This way, it's a little more organized than I'm not struggling with people who want the same

591
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,540
part and so on and so on. It's slow going right now while we try to get jostled into the main

592
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:06,100
character roles and get the recorded voices all together. But once everyone's in position,

593
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,740
I should be able to produce a new episode, once every couple of weeks at first, and then hopefully

594
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:16,100
once a week as I get the production process streamlined. In the meantime, keep your ears open for

595
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,620
the sonic boom. I think this project is going to make it a podcast community. If it cracks your windows,

596
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:26,580
let me know so I can get a check to you, huh? Thanks again, pod, father. See you, Mac.

597
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:32,980
Out. All right, man. Thank you. That's Jay Mac's brother. I think, from not mistaken.

598
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:39,940
And so these projects, this is something really beautiful. It's taking place here. If you look at

599
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:46,980
what happened with pod safe for peace, 32 pod safe artists, all mixed, all virtual people who

600
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:56,820
never met each other, not before, not since. If you look at the friends and technology,

601
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,580
Christmas Carol, their geeky Christmas Carol, one of their in their series of, where's it,

602
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:13,140
nightmares from the server room. If you look at this project, children of the gods, if you look at

603
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:19,940
comment, have you heard of the podcast, a podcast Christmas Carol at apodcastChristmas Carol.com.

604
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,340
Wow, this was great. I had a small role in it. I was really thankful that I was allowed to participate.

605
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:30,020
When I heard it all come back, I was just amazed at the shit we can do. And we're putting,

606
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,900
I mean, this is a 50 minute drama, and it's compelling. It's good. You know, this is story to it.

607
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,740
And of course, it's all tongue and cheek. And we're kind of making fun of the radio industry.

608
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:47,220
But it's great, you know, and how quickly we're able to organize and and create a mashup,

609
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,380
there you go. Once again, you know, what the hell was that? That was a complete mashup. We made

610
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:57,220
entertainment ourselves. This is really important stuff that's happening here. I'm excited about it.

611
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:03,620
Note to self, must make the mashboard, whatever the fuck that is. And an update on the

612
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,900
tie. We're just going to get it through everything today. I got like six more items on my list.

613
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:13,540
Frank Yonan, by far and away, has sent in the most beautiful design for my tattoo that I've

614
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:18,100
been thinking of getting. No, I'm convinced I'm getting it now. We're now down to the final bits of

615
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:23,380
design Patricia has taken his design and has made some adaptations. I'm going to scan those,

616
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:30,580
email them back to him. And then I guess I'm just going to have it made. I'm really excited about this.

617
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:37,620
And trucker Tom, if you know, trucker Tom is, or if you don't, go search Flickr for trucker Tom

618
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:47,620
tags. And you'll see that he without a doubt is an expert when it comes to tattoo. I think 50

619
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:52,500
percent of his body or something like that is tattooed. And he sent me this wonderful, of course,

620
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:58,900
I packed it away. Now, he sent me this wonderful, like quick start guide, which was a project I

621
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,180
guess he worked on a while ago. It was kind of like, you know, when you open up a new gadget,

622
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,020
you have the manual and then you have the quick start manual. So this was a part of what was supposed

623
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:10,340
to be a series of quick start guides. And it was a 10 step quick start guide to getting a tattoo.

624
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:16,660
And there's some really, yeah, there was some really good information in there. And some some

625
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,660
good, thoughtful things. You know, one of the, and also some jargons. You kind of know what you're

626
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,740
talking about, but also some recommendations like never, ever ever get someone's name tattoo.

627
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:32,420
You know, your body bad idea. So appreciate it, Trucker Tom. Really do. And what I'll do is I'll

628
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:38,180
put the, when we have the final design, I'll put it up in the show notes, a show notes. You could

629
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:47,060
take a look at it. And then, you know, what? Now, I think that was Patricia calling for Christina

630
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:55,460
not for me. Anyway, uh, egg nog. Uh, I was waiting for this to happen. I think Patricia's

631
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:00,500
calling Christina. Uh, Amy Bugbee says, Adam, heard your call for egg nog recipes. And here's

632
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:06,020
mine actually made it my very first podcast at crime in cookies.com. Go to the cookie cast about

633
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:11,700
four minutes long. And I give the entire recipe and directions. Rum and whiskey. Imagine that. Um,

634
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,260
you got it, Amy. Thank you very much. I'm going to, I'm, I've chosen your recipe because you're

635
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:23,300
the first one to do a podcast of it. So, I'm going to use that. Let me see, now onto the blank

636
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:30,260
media tax. Um, and I think we should wind this up pretty soon. Uh, I think the first thing I have

637
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,140
here is a comment from Darrell. Let me see, it looks a little four minutes maybe long. Let's see what

638
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:39,780
it was. I think it was actually something pretty good. Hey, Adam, this is Darrell Falman with

639
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:45,620
Roscoe podcast. And this has to do with you. Oh, yeah, right. He's a lawyer or he's a lawyer in

640
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:50,340
making, but it's the law school podcast. So, yeah. So, I want to definitely listen to this because

641
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:57,380
he goes into the United States code and statutory law about who is allowed to collect money from

642
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:02,020
blank media. It's four, it's four minutes long. So, you might want to skip ahead if you're

643
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:07,140
completely uninterested, but he has some really good pieces of information that he's dealt up

644
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:12,820
for us that I think you want to listen to. Your performance rights. I tried to do some research

645
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:18,180
on this a little bit to find out what to deal with. I really cannot believe that there'd be a charge

646
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:25,780
for a digital audio recording mediums as it's defined by the United States code. But anyway,

647
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:33,300
there is a fee for that. A digital audio recording medium is any material object and form

648
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,740
commonly distributed for use by individuals that is primarily marketed or most commonly used

649
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:44,260
by consumers for the purpose of making digital audio copied recordings by use of a digital

650
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:52,100
audio recording device. So, that could be a recordable seating raw. Now, here we have the royalty

651
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:59,380
payments. Digital audio recording media. This is a total 17 chapter 10 subjectorsc section

652
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:06,180
one thousand four under the United States code. The royalty payment do under section one thousand three

653
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:12,420
for each digital audio recording medium imported into and distributed in the United States

654
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:18,500
or manufactured and distributed in the United States shall be 3% of the transfer price.

655
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,700
Only the first person to manufacture and distribute or import and distribute such media shall be

656
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:29,860
required to pay the royalty with respect to these such media. Now, under the United States code

657
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:36,260
title 17 chapter 10 subjectorsc section one thousand six, this is the allocation of royalty payments.

658
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:42,420
It's in two funds. Number one, the sound recordings fund. They get 66 and three two thirds per cent.

659
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:48,180
Two and five eights per cent of that goes to now's for a escrow account managed by an

660
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:54,020
independent administrator and also the interested copyright parties that are the non-featured

661
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,980
musicians. That's two and five eights per cent to them. One and three eights per cent of the

662
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:07,460
royalty payments allocated go to non-featured vocalist and then forty percent of the remaining. So,

663
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:12,020
forty percent of the remaining after two and five eights and after one and three eights of the

664
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:17,620
66 and two thirds that's complicated all this fractions. But forty percent of that goes

665
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:24,580
to the sound recordings fund and shall be distributed to the featured recording artists. And then

666
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:30,900
sixty percent other remaining of the remaining royalty payments shall be distributed to the owners.

667
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:38,820
Okay, so now we have thirty-for-one-third percent left. Fifty percent of that will go to the music

668
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:44,100
publishers and then, I mean, do I say thirty percent of that fifty percent? Fifty percent

669
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:49,380
goes to the music publishers and fifty percent goes to the writers. So, there you have it.

670
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:55,860
I just started doing some research on this. I'm interested to learn some more, find out who

671
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:04,180
the sound recordings fund is and, you know, who all these parties are. And it's just kind of

672
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:12,980
interesting, I'll post some information in the show notes from your DSC 302. And you can read

673
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:18,900
it there and also links back to my website and maybe some other links as well. One interesting thing,

674
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:26,340
I found a case while I was doing some research that had the RIA and they were basically

675
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:31,780
going wanted to go to arbitration on the amount of money that they were getting and what they

676
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:39,060
wanted was something like forty-some percent instead of like two percent or whatever and they ended

677
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:47,780
up getting about six percent from music and a couple of other companies. But anyway, interesting stuff

678
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:54,900
and cut out what you need. I know it's a bunch of garbage but the basics of this is that,

679
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:02,180
yes, there is a three percent charge on the transfer price for media in the United States.

680
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,780
Have a good one. I hope you have a great Christmas. Talk to you later.

681
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:12,420
Hold on. What happened? Yeah, I'm doing the show so you walk in, you're on the show.

682
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:18,660
I'm into theory. No, so I have to use your keys. Well, no, you don't have to. You can go find your key.

683
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,700
I know, but I have to go to sense, Barry, and by, well, you do some, will you buy something for me

684
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:29,700
while you're there? You know, there's a new Gillette G3 Razor with a vibrator in it.

685
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:37,780
Really? Yes. It's supposed to be the, yeah, yeah, I've seen it there at Sainsbury. It's

686
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:43,860
a, it comes with a battery and the whole thing. Really? Yeah. Oh. Can you go one of those for me?

687
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:51,780
Yeah. Okay, thank you. Love you. Bye. So, um, back to that, man, this is going to be such a long

688
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:58,260
podcast. But hey, it's not often that Christmas and Hanukkah start on the same day.

689
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,620
Thank you very much for going through all the trouble there to find to find out that information

690
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:11,780
about the code. This is exactly what your government is doing, ladies and gentlemen, and notice that

691
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:16,500
stuff goes into arbitration when they, when someone else wants to muscle in and get some,

692
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,900
some money out of this pool, how about just independent programmers? If it's only about

693
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:27,460
copying files and not specified as music, then anyone could delve into that. Man, man, that's, that's

694
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:33,060
what your government does. You, you wonder why Holly would donate so much money? Well, duh,

695
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:37,300
this is how they get it back, you know, by getting able to being able to cut these kind of deals

696
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,940
on the back end. Doesn't matter. I, I don't, I'm not interested in any of that. Let's say,

697
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:46,100
well, they're all busy, you know, meeting and going into arbitration about how to divvy up the

698
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,820
dough. Let's create our own pool. You know, let's create our own pool of cash and let's surprise them.

699
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:55,540
When they wake up, we'll say, well, sorry, we got everything running over here. Just find new rules

700
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,780
and Doug Pilgrim really takes it to the extreme and he's so right. He says, hey, isn't blank paper used

701
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:06,180
some of the time to copyright material? Can you imagine the shitstorm that would be creative?

702
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:13,220
There was a fee or a tax on blank paper? Why not? If the RIA can tax CDs, why not let publishers

703
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:20,340
tax blank paper? You know, it wouldn't surprise me if they already do. When not surprised me at all.

704
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:29,780
Okay, I don't know how this one got by my, you know, my RSS reader, but apparently Apple is selling

705
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:39,460
a podcast server and there's been some talk about that on the boards. I don't know, I mean,

706
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:44,100
it would work for businesses. I think actually is being sold as a business podcast server.

707
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:51,300
And let me see, there was a, oh, man, I got this whole PDF about the Australian version of

708
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:56,740
AskCat, the amount of AskCat. I might just take a look at it for a second. There was a reason why I

709
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:04,020
put it into my, into my outliner. Oh, yeah, they have, oh, yeah, it's the podcast license from

710
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:14,020
the RP, APRA, which is Australia's version of AskCat slash BMI. What was the thing I wanted to talk

711
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:21,540
about here? It was so complicated. Here we go. So this license is good up until the 31st of December

712
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:31,620
2006. Podcast containing music works are licensed at 1.925%. That's including a value added tax

713
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:36,980
of gross revenue. So any money you receive, all of all the money you get for your podcast.

714
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:41,780
And that would include barter as well. So if you receive something in trade, you'd have to

715
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:53,460
basically pay cash your fee. It's subject to a minimum fee of 1.62 cents per work per subscriber.

716
01:02:54,420 --> 01:03:02,580
Cap.16.5 cents per podcast per subscriber. So I guess if you had to show where you had like 10 songs

717
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:10,820
or but does it even have 10 or 20, then essentially you have to pay. This is amazing. 16 cents.

718
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:20,980
Per work per subscriber. That sounds, let's just take it at the, let's just make it two cents

719
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:26,020
just to make it easy, okay? Because that's a little bit above the minimum fee. So if you have,

720
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:32,660
like I just, I'm going to have three songs in this show. So that would be six cents.

721
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:42,420
And then I have to multiply it by the subscribers. So even I would go broke.

722
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:47,700
Now it doesn't say anything about if you don't make any money,

723
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:56,340
which I think means that the minimum subject to a minimum fee that I think you always have to pay

724
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:02,420
the 1.62 cents. And those are Australian cents. I presume, Australian dollar cents.

725
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,340
Wow. Yeah, that's great. But I don't think it's really going to work.

726
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:16,500
And of course, the real question is of that fee, does any of that money go to the actual independent

727
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:23,060
artist who created the music? I don't think we're there yet, guys. I really don't.

728
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:29,780
What I do know is that we're definitely there for this year, for this podcast,

729
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:36,420
and I think it is kind of unique that Hanukkah starts on the 25th of December, which is Christmas Day.

730
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,980
And I want to, yeah, really, I want to wish you all a very Merry Christmas. We don't have

731
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,660
a Hanukkah Podsafe piece, but perhaps that will happen next year.

732
01:04:53,060 --> 01:05:08,500
That time I went down, feels like at that time again, to me, the mistletoe, a Christmas show,

733
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:21,300
and the lighting of that famous Christmas tree, people are shopping for their loved ones.

734
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:35,300
I'm making plans for Christmas feets, learning all goes by, and I'm playing golf now.

735
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:48,500
And then we have to wait another year, while in every day, Christmas,

736
01:05:49,220 --> 01:06:02,260
what I wonder more, this would be, you never feel blue, we make all our dreams come true,

737
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:06,820
whenever it's possible, we're every day.

738
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:24,180
It was time to bring out the good people. I just look around now and you will see it.

739
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:36,980
Yeah, everybody's nice and full of light, and they get to those who aren't me,

740
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:50,100
and they get everything that every day, Christmas, what I wonder more, this would be,

741
01:06:50,100 --> 01:07:06,020
we'll never feel blue, we make all our dreams come true, we're Christmas, we're every day.

742
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:20,900
