14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
going on but it's been really quiet which is good so time for the source code.

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,640

32
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

33
00:06:46,720 --> 00:07:16,720
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, pretty much, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah,

34
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:27,220
And so yesterday it was actually perfect, everything worked fine until it hit an AAC file that I'd purchased from iTunes music store

35
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,720
and it hung on that and for some reason this is totally hanging on this one which is just a regular MP3, I don't know what's going on.

36
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I still think it's my Mac, you know what?

37
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I have to say that being a Mac user, and to see although it wasn't mine, it was my dad's, we had a Mac, an Apple 2,

38
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:57,720
we had, we had that, I didn't do much on that. My first real Mac was the Mac Plus, although I did learn how to use a Mac on the 512.

39
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Is that the 512K or something like that? It was basically the operating system you had to boot from a floppy disk.

40
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,720
And my philosophy is, once and a while I just got a, you know, buying a new one.

41
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,720
And then they'd you, you know, repurpose the other one for something else to rip off the entire OS and, you know, reinstall it.

42
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:27,720
And then usually it all the problems clear up. I did that recently when I upgraded both my machines to tiger, the power book which I'm running now was fine.

43
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,720
The other power book which the screen broke on that power book, oh man, a year ago.

44
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,720
And I thought, well, instead of sending it off, I'll just plug it into my cinema display and use it that way.

45
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:49,720
I really should have it fixed, but, you know, there you go. It's just like, oh well, just get a new one.

46
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Because it's fun. It's like going to the, it's like buying shoes, I guess.

47
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:01,720
For Patricia, it would be like, oh, I guess I do. Let's see.

48
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Let me see who this is right now inside. Hello. Hello.

49
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Yes. Hey, Lee, I'm writing the middle of the source code. Can I call you back? Okay, bye.

50
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,720
That's fun. Let's leave Wilkins. Remember, man, was that probably half a year ago? Yeah, more than half a year ago.

51
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Lee Wilkins and his, is lovely girlfriend, wait. Is it, are they married now, Jenny?

52
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,720
I've to look that up. They're, they moved to the States and then they moved back almost two weeks later.

53
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,720
And because of the circumstances, the way the dogs were exported, they've two lovely little dogs.

54
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,720
What they jack Russells, I believe, they couldn't be imported back again. So they had to go into quarantine for six months.

55
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,720
And I think we raised like $700, which is what they needed to get all that done. And I think the dogs came home yesterday.

56
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:03,720
So I'll, I'll make sure I put a link in the show notes today to, to Lee's weblog and podcast. Those guys are pretty happy. I'm sure. Okay.

57
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:15,720
So I'm going to be talking about my chat with Don Katz this morning. Oh, yesterday, I played, was that yesterday? I think it was, yes, I played Rob Coslo.

58
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Maybe it was the day before yesterday.

59
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:29,720
The instrumental piece of pod safe music. Wow, I got a lot of response to that. And it's not just from Rob. I mean, he sent a whole bunch of emails through to me. People just go nuts about his stuff.

60
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,720
So I'll put another link to his website in today.

61
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Because it looks like, you know, there's, I don't know, it's just the, it's struck a chord with a whole bunch of people and everyone really liked it.

62
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:51,720
I think it, for me, even it was a bit off, you know, off color like that. It's not the typical piece of pod safe music I play. And actually, it's P. W. Fenton, who picks all this stuff out.

63
00:10:51,720 --> 00:11:01,720
He's producing the, the pod show on serious. And essentially, we have a whole, we have a pretty cool system set up. It could still be better. And we're, we're actually using Megaseg,

64
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:16,720
to schedule these four hours a day of, of podcasts and promos and pod safe music and mashups. And of course, my, my, my, my, my, what would just call them voice drops or tracks or wraparounds, you know, whatever.

65
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:28,720
And so it's a, it's a very cool system. But what does have to be done is, you know, there's all the stuff that's incoming. And so that's put in, in a shared drive and, you know, we can look at stuff and I can drop stuff in.

66
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Hey, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's really cool. And he's finding some amazing things really is not, so that, that was one of his picks. Okay, it's your daily source code. It's Friday and, uh, got lots of promos. Let's get to it.

67
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:48,720
And now, I'm going to let you fly from D to D with a part of the system that I like on the point of it. It's the future podcast.

68
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,720
You can post it in this picture. Listen now, if there's ransom rates, if there's personal mobiles to deal on, they work.

69
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,720
No topic is left on spirit. This is now at www.minkview.com.

70
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Hey, Adam, it's Bill Powers from the Fantasy Focus podcast. Every week, Chris Adams and I will take a look at the world of fantasy baseball.

71
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Well, tour the major leagues. Take a peek at the injury reports and how it may affect your fantasy squad.

72
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:39,720
And, of course, the fantasy stugs and duds from the week before. So give us a try. Download us at fantasyfocuspodcast.com.

73
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Thanks, Adam.

74
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Yeah.

75
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Love that completely non-podsafe, Metallica in the background, man. I wonder if the guys give us shit about that. Technically, that's illegal, by the way.

76
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,720
People ask me that all the time. Yes, if you put together promos and sweepers with non-podsafe music, that's really not supposed to be done.

77
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Okay. So this morning, actually had a great experience going to London. I hadn't done a half day trip or planned one in the past.

78
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720
We just kind of, you know, go in and have a meeting and come back.

79
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,720
It was really good because I dropped Christina off at school at 830 and then I went to the station. It's only two minutes from her school.

80
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Literally, you know, like within walking distance.

81
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:27,720
And there's a train almost every 10 minutes, which is it's almost an express train that goes from Guilford to London.

82
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,720
It stops only at walking, I think, and I forget the other one.

83
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:42,720
And while the lady at the ticket office was nice enough to give me this little mini booklet just, you know, it's so cool. It's exactly what someone is doing business once.

84
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:53,720
You know, so you can put in your shirt pocket, you know, it's just that particular line. It really gives you the information about the direct lines, the direct trains and not the ones that stop a million times, which I've taken before, believe me. You don't want to make that mistake.

85
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:04,720
So it was a 35 minutes into Waterloo, hop in the cab from the cab. Although this was kind of interesting. We agreed to meet Don Katzenai at

86
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:16,720
But we'll cover in Garden Hotel. And so here's a cab drive who didn't know the Coven Garden Hotel, which was I didn't quite that that was weird to me because I thought these guys had the knowledge and I suppose to know everything.

87
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,720
So that was the first, but I have myself on with me and I went over to Google local.

88
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Not even sure how I got there, but it just kind of worked on my cell phones pre installed Virgin Mobile does that.

89
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,720
And there was, you know, had the address and I could look in a little map. I could literally walk to it. That was a very nice experience.

90
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Don was there and I hadn't Googled him before going.

91
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Normally I do that just to say, oh, this is what he looks like. I can't remember. I don't know what Don looks like. Actually, I do.

92
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,720
He was a journalist for Rolling Stone Magazine and a accomplished writer himself.

93
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,720
And he co founded audible.com years ago. I think it was 95, 96.

94
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,720
And we had a really good chat. And let me tell you, here's a guy who.

95
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:11,720
First of all, he is feeling some of the pressure of running a public company and Ron and I, our previous company was public.

96
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,720
And it's really tough because you get distracted by a lot of crap that is.

97
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Yeah, I mean, you at a certain point you're really going to have to evaluate if you, if you should be a public company or not.

98
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,720
But of course, this is a company that went public in 1999, which is just about the worst time you could do that.

99
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
But wrote it out. And that's, that's the impressive part.

100
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,720
I wrote the storm out. And they're still around and they're doing very well. They're growing.

101
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:45,720
And now Don and I have a similar agreement that that I have with Steve Jobs, you know, no damage announcements.

102
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:53,720
And we can, you know, we don't have to sign anything. We'll just agree that we keep the parts of our conversation and be a confidential confidential.

103
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,720
And of course, we talked about working together. So, whoops.

104
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Man, it's busy today. The OK around. What's this? Oh, there's a text from my daughter. Okay. All right. She's hanging out with friends after school. Got, you know, moms not here. Remember, so I got to do it all on myself.

105
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Oh, boy. I can hear moms everywhere going shut up. I can hear the mommy cast groaning as we speak.

106
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:28,720
He has a strategy for podcasting, primarily for podcasting, what he calls premium content. And I think it's a good strategy. And I think it makes sense.

107
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:39,720
And I think there's definitely a place for that. And he has, yes, some damn announcement coming up, which will, I think, show the way of how we're thinking, how the company's thinking.

108
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:56,720
And what's nice about it is that we pretty much agree that we can work together because, you know, when I talk about our pod show definitely has a different model, but, you know, they could cross over. They could, there's intersection. So it could be interesting.

109
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:21,720
So it was a nice chat. And we had a nice breakfast. And I hopped back in the cab, went back to Waterloo Station, trains running every 15 minutes. Actually, it's fast on the way back 30 minutes. I was back home by, you know, I won 130. So that was really good. That was a enjoyable. So hopefully, hopefully, don will make some damn announcements at Nomedex.

110
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Hey, Adam, I'd like to ask all of your listeners to give listening to AirFurga try. Each week at AirFurga, me and my wife Shelley Piccatopic, and we give it the AirFurga spin.

111
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Anything from music to movies, TV, politics. And in fact, our most recent episode actually centered around poetry. And here's an example of a bit that we did on that episode.

112
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Let's call the lost pages of Dr. Sus. Hello, and welcome once again to the lost pages of Dr. Sus.

113
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:58,720
I am your host, Neville Furf and Burger. This week's installment comes from a lost manuscript that many thought never existed in the first place.

114
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:10,720
It's called the Fields Freshness Fix. And it deals with the problem that many people have in society today, and it tells you how to overcome it, how to rise above, and come together as a family.

115
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Please enjoy the Fields Freshness Fix.

116
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Here in this house where the Fields Family grew, a problem arose, and that problem grew too.

117
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Behind a closed door that was shut and locked tight, Jim Fields and Jan Fields did what they did at night. In the midst of the doings, the grouping and tickles.

118
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Jim smelled what he thought was a four-year-old pickle, with resolve and great courage Jim did not slow down. He took care of the business that he had downtown.

119
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Jim was very determined and not very fickle, but this task became daunting even for a lover of pickles.

120
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,720
And it was not just poor Jim who breathed pickled air, the children and neighbors they all breathed their share.

121
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,720
So finally when you mean Jim sat down with Jan, he opened and spilled the beans out of the can.

122
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Oh my, I must do something Jan then exclaim, then Jim and Jan fields sat with the storm of their brains.

123
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I'll scrub it said Jan and she reached for a brush that was made to do scrubbing and harsh to the touch, so scrub she did Jan until she was swollen and sore, but there was little less odor when she'd finished the job.

124
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Some perfume said Jim, the finest money can buy, so he coded her business in Chanel number five.

125
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,720
But after some time perhaps maybe an hour, the smell came back only mixed with some flowers.

126
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,720
said Jan, is it time I give Douching a try? This condition is embarrassing and burns the kids eyes.

127
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,720
How could you? Why should you? It's just vinegar and water. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy's daughter.

128
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,720
We need something stronger, something stronger for sure, so he went to his workbench and he opened the drawer.

129
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Jan watched with great wonder as Jim sat there mixing.

130
00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Wondering what mixed Mr. Jim fields was fixing. A breath of fresh air, a hummingbird's beak, a rose and a lilac, a snow capped mountain peak.

131
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,720
A cup of stream water he pulled from a stream, a shiny star's twinkle, a full moon's moon being.

132
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:14,720
He pulled out his stir and stirred it quite good, then dipped his balls in it as any good stir or wood.

133
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,720
This is our last chance, said Jim fields to his wife, our last chance to remove the sped smell from our life.

134
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,720
So without hesitation he then poured the mixture from the beaker in two Jan fields warmly fixture.

135
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Within seconds or moments sometime very soon the sweet smell of roses encircled the room.

136
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,720
At last it had happened and freshness abounds. There will be no more tears and p-u-ing sounds.

137
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,720
So remember, if freshness is something you lack, a Zeus doosh is the thing that will bring it right back.

138
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Oh my, what a wonderful tale with a happy ending and a good message to boot.

139
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Well, that's all for this time. Join us next time for the Lost Pages of Dr. Zeus.

140
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Goodbye!

141
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Well, hopefully that gives everybody an idea what airferg is all about.

142
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,720

143
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,720
It's not just a podcast, it's like a doosh for your mind.

144
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Alright, I'll take it.

145
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Foughts a music now on the source code. Here's Brother Loves Push!

146
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
What?

147
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Let me stay, what a way you wanna be with you.

148
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
What?

149
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,720
To walk away, let me stay, let me be with you.

150
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,720
I search me so slowly, I hear years,

151
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Oh yeah, I'm thinking no, no, no, no, no.

152
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,720
I'm lagging in the fogging out, and you make it so hard.

153
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Yet, tell me no, no, no.

154
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,720
You're having to go here, you push my hands down and run

155
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,720
And say, can't take control, you're so afraid.

156
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Afraid I'm laying you, I'm not that true

157
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,720
You always messin' with your heads and now

158
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Let me stay, you wanna play, you wanna be with you

159
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Let me be with you baby, we have a push

160
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Don't walk away, let me stay, let me be with you

161
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Don't let it end this way

162
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Everybody, breathe for the girl

163
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
I will live, I will live, I will live

164
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
What about the band of girls?

165
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
I love the band of girls, I love the band of girls

166
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,720
I used to go right now, I know, yeah

167
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,720
We got so sexy when we make it dancing so far

168
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
I'm going to stay, yeah, I'm not playing here

169
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,720
We're just not used to guys, not messing with your heads and now

170
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Everybody, stay, you wanna play, you wanna be with you

171
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Let me be with you baby, don't let it end this way

172
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Don't walk away, let me stay, let me be with you

173
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Don't let it end this way

174
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
I think you wish I was a different person

175
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,720
All together, I do believe I am the right one

176
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
You're from town, if you don't know why I put up with

177
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
We're so crazy, yeah, yeah

178
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
We can't be happy overnight, yeah

179
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,720
We're just not used to standing, yeah

180
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
We're just not used to standing, yeah

181
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Everybody, stay, you wanna play, wanna be with you

182
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Let me be with you baby, don't let it end this way

183
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,720
You wanna play, wanna be with you

184
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Yeah, understand you, welcome somebody

185
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
ass

186
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,720
I love you, understand you, yeah

187
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
We're just not used to juego

188
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:14,720
I just wanted to share it with you one more time. So another hiccup there. This is very frustrating.

189
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm going to ask a Ron Bloom question right now. This is my partner's thinking and this is how

190
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,960
fresh that I am that I'm the now, you know, this is where I'd say Ron now you need to help me out

191
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,320
with a technology and he usually gets it fixed because he'd say, well, let's see, the firewire

192
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:37,040
cable you're using between your firewire drive where the MP3's are located and the Mac.

193
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:44,400
I'm actually using the firewire cord that came with my eyesight. Now, as I was sitting here listening

194
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,920
to that hiccup and then jamming out of course with the song, I was noticing this wire is very thin

195
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,640
compared to any other firewire cable that I have. Do you Abby could this have something to do

196
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,280
with the hiccup is it maybe that I'm getting less of a transfer rate because of this shitty cable

197
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:08,640
or do I not know what I'm talking about? Okay. Hey, I told you I was a little tired and I just remembered

198
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,840
why last night before I went to bed, it was around midnight and I was all set to go to bed

199
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,920
and then the Gilmore gang showed up the virtual Gilmore gang. Now, over the weekend, actually

200
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,360
before the week and I'm Friday I spoke to Steve Gilmore and he said, well, I don't think that's

201
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,560
going to be a Gilmore gang this weekend because I'm I'm going to Singapore, he's attending a conference,

202
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,040
he's speaking in a conference and I was going to be on the plane with Steve Wozniak and it was going

203
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,240
to be, you know, all kinds of cool stuff and he was going to do stuff from there. I said, but you

204
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,960
do, you know, skipping one weekend this like, you know, you can't just stick the needle in and pull

205
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:48,480
it out again, that just doesn't work. So he called two of the gang members who are also

206
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,960
spread out all over the world, Doc Seroles himself was in God. Well, he's in Denmark, I think

207
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,720
Steve Wozniak, I'm pretty funny when you hear it, that you can hear Doc of, you know, when you

208
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,080
call someone up and or when someone calls you and you know, wake you up and then the first thing

209
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,640
you say is, did I wake you and the first thing you always say? No, not at all. I was I was awake.

210
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Why do we do that? When I, yeah, Cox Zucker, you woke me up. I refused to have a phone in the

211
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,240
bedroom for that very reason. I don't care. Whatever it is, if it was the middle of the night, I can't

212
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,120
help you anyway. I need to sleep. So, but it was, it was a long Gilmour gang and I guess Steve

213
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,400
did the, the calls via Skype from Singapore and then edited on his, on his Mac and then uploaded it

214
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,240
to the servers and got everything up and rolling and it was great. But it was now in half, so it was

215
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,240
like 130 before I realized that here I was just listened to the show. Give it a, give it a go though.

216
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,720
If you're into, in fact, the topic was about Intel and Apple and I know it's kind of been

217
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
been beat to death by the trade press, but I want to hear the gang members. I want to hear what they

218
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,320
have to say about it. And you know, I love hearing that balance of ideas and what it means and

219
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,440
not even though I have nothing really to do with that industry and that regard, it's kind of cool.

220
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,360
Gilmour gang. What was it? Gilmour gang.podshow.com. A hearty blend of reality TV, celebrity gossip,

221
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:14,960
police blotter and Dawson's Creek re-run. Time for the Delta Park Project. On this week's show

222
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,680
was a suspicious frying pan. It's a David Hasselhoff couple of rhinestone cows shooting cats from

223
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,920
canons. I like squishing peas in my mouth. I dislike my cat's wookie breath. Did you hear

224
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,400
about Willie Nelson and Nora Jones looking up? Okay, but what is the monster on loss? Make Delta

225
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Park Project part of your weekly ritual on the inner web at DeltaParkProject.com.

226
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,600
So I ran through my iPod or this morning and I'm subscribed to OpenPodcast.org's OpenPodcast

227
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,160
feed and low on behold, what showed up actually was like a day or two late. Our friend

228
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,240
Sandra Lowell and those of you who've been listening to the source code for a longer time were

229
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,880
to episode 196 now. Your call, she is our very own tap dancing newscaster.

230
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,680
We have other countries in seeing Michael Ballforday. Thank you here in Gallard just to do this

231
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:59,360
was how it would be. And other news, a planet was discovered that could be like the planet

232
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,000
Earth. It was around the nearby store that had hovered. But far enough, we'll maybe get

233
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,160
Michael's career remorse. Even on our planet there could be success where he's head. But

234
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:21,120
what will become a sister-determined top step made a mess of this case gone wrong. It won't be long.

235
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,840
Till his career's gone unless Michael writes him into another song. Stay tuned for late

236
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:38,080
ranking hope days. That's the tap dancing podcast news.

237
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,440
Oh man, I had that all set up. It was supposed to be fucking seamless. Oh dude. Okay.

238
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,360
Give me a second. Wow, I'm back. That was whoa. That was pretty awesome.

239
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,400
I had a kill mega-sag and I got all kinds of errors. I took screenshots. I'll send it off to

240
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,840
the developers. Of course it's beta, but I said okay let's try it again everybody. See this works.

245
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,800

246
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,520
To the Rocky Horrors Show.

247
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,320
Look got fixed and bailed by us with just a bunch of new drill fangs.

248
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,960
But now you took your virgin dragon.

249
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I found you lying in the snow.

250
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,680
Cougars and blow. Cougars and blow.

251
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:13,040
I am now home. So proud of their holy sun. They come to see if you would have been fun.

252
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:31,040
I said that I'll ask you if I ever saw you again. You're still being at a clock all day.

253
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:43,040
I found you lying in the snow. Cougars and blow.

254
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Cougars and blow. Cougars and blow. Cougars and blow.

255
00:32:51,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Cougars and blow. Cougars and blow.

256
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Cougars and blow. Cougars and blow.

257
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Cougars and blow.

258
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Cougars and blow. What more does a growing boy really need?

00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I have a conference call coming up. Let's end the show. Now I've messed around long enough with all the bits and nights.

260
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Have you ever suffered a week and a week?

261
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,240
Next week, Patricia comes back early in the week. I think she comes back Tuesday. Then Wednesday,

262
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,040
I'm off, which is I believe the 22nd. And then the 23rd to the 25th is Dome Dex and Seattle.

263
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,040
That's what I'm going to be. So I'm looking forward to that. And of course we'll be podcasting the source code from there as well.

264
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Feedback is very welcome. Adam at curie.com. You can send along MP3, audio feedback and feel like it.

265
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:35,040
DailySourceCode.com is where you can find the podcast feed to subscribe to the show. You can check out the archives, the latest addition of the source code.

266
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,040
And just to confuse you with more URLs, www.curie.com or comments on the web blog.

267
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:51,040
I post the show notes up there as well. So anything you hear in the DailySource Code, you can probably find a link to it right there.

268
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,040
I need some more tea.

269
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:05,040
All right, forget. Craig Maloney, thank you very much for the pod father Photoshop job you did. I freaking love it.

270
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,040
I think that's, I should start embedding that into my M3 files.

271
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Maybe the press will finally use a picture that I pick out for them. I'll send them while the ugly ones.

272
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,040
See that's exactly the problem. Nothing left to say. I'm just going to shut up.

273
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,040
I'll talk you on Monday.

274
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Unless of course something happens over the weekend that would make sense to chat about.

275
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Take care everybody. Have a great weekend. Bye bye.

276
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Another pod show podcast. Stick it in your ear.
