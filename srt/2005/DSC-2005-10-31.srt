00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:26,280
carry out the podcast on Delta Shira Charley.

515
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,560
This week, the travel commons podcast turns number 20, and that's right.

516
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,800
The 20th travel commons podcast talks this week about the airline experience.

517
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Travel.

518
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
It's a people business.

519
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,520
Though there have been many advances in technology.

520
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,440
I'll tell you, I'd be at to receive a heartfelt apology from a website.

521
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,960
The rise of the virtual airline, outsourcing flight attendants, and what's next?

522
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Then the pilots?

523
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I mean, these are the people who deliver the service on buying.

524
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,480
Well, after you do that, what's left?

525
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,200
You know, a logo, some gates, a frequent flyer program, and the boundaries and the rules

526
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,360
of personal space at 35,000 feet.

527
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,800
The seat that I'm in is mine.

528
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,360
The back of my seat, to the back of the seat in front of me, from the floor, up to

529
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,440
the ceiling in the outer armrest.

530
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Oh, my, all this and listen your feedback at the travel commons podcast, www.travelcomons.com,

531
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,200
our Mark Peacock, and I hope to see you there.

532
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Take care.

533
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,600
Oh, Mark, thank you very much.

534
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,520
That marks the guy who poops in toilets around the world and tells you about it.

536
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,120
It's an interesting thought there about airlines, basically outsourcing everything.

537
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:44,400
I, of course, I took Virgin back from San Francisco to London on the upper class flight

538
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,720
of course.

539
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,280
And they've now, I knew that this was happening.

540
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,000
They've changed the ground crew.

541
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,280
They outsource that now.

542
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,640
They were there before that they had full-time employees who were working for Virgin.

543
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,600
And I must say that, you know, I could tell the difference that they had outsource that,

544
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
because, well, I don't know, you could just, I mean, first of all, there were different

545
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
faces.

546
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,800
That was kind of a tip off.

547
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,680
I actually had a brief conversation with the flight attend to the ground stewardess who

548
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,240
checked me and she said, yeah, you know, we're, we're from the outsource.

549
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
We're from a different company.

550
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
But this is my only account.

551
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,840
So, I, that works too, I guess.

552
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
That makes sense.

553
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,040
It's a, from a business perspective, but you got to be careful with this stuff.

554
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,960
Because, yeah, you know, when you say outsourcing pilots, it's kind of freaky, but it

555
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
does already happen.

556
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,320
Many, certainly, I think holiday airlines.

557
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,440
I don't know what the regulations are about that either.

558
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,800
That's kind of interesting.

559
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,800
But there's, sure, are a lot of pilots out there who feel very much members of their

560
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
family.

561
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,920
Goldis and the Joe D on fly with me podcast.

562
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,480
He really feels that he's a member of his airline, a member of the airline family.

563
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,240
And he's interviewed flight attendants about, you hear that?

564
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
That's the crackberry, not dim it.

565
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Unbelievable.

566
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,880
The technology is kind of failing me today, although it was, I snapped the mixer right

567
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
back in.

568
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Everything worked again.

569
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
Perfectly the way I wanted it.

570
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,840
So, you know, Windows is being very rude wanting to continuously reboot on me, don't

571
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,600
you can't do that, not during the Delta share at Charlie.

572
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,080
And before that, real Australia, that sounds like a very interesting podcast.

573
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,160
You know, it's not, first of all, I told you, I'd love to live in Australia.

574
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,120
It's just too damn far from, from family, I guess, that's, that's the biggest problem.

575
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,800
If, if Patricia didn't have any family, yeah, we would have been gone by now without

576
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
a doubt.

577
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,080
Probably the might have happened, it definitely could have happened.

578
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,200
You can't just move to Australia, you know, you've got to have something unique.

579
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,160
You know, it doesn't matter how much money you have either.

580
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,960
There's really all kinds of rules and regulations when it comes to immigrating into Australia.

581
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,800
You can't just show up and say, all right, here I am.

582
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Oh, I've got plenty of money.

583
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,120
Yep, they're not interested in that.

584
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,240
It really does take more.

585
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,200
You got to have some, you got to be like a rocket scientist or something.

586
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,960
Now, the makes sense, I think that's pretty good, actually.

587
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,480
I got to, I should see if I can drag Patricia in, have her on the show, talk.

588
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Huh?

589
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
See if she's around.

590
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Huh?

591
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
No.

592
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Okay.

593
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Uh, let's see what's going to say, yes, man, I've so many other things to talk about.

594
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,400
It's just, it's, I've got to say, it's just so good to be back.

595
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
It's good to be ahead of the times because I know that by the time you're listening to

596
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,520
this, it, actually, you're going to get up in the morning, hopefully, and this will

597
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,160
be the first thing you download.

598
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,320
Um, it's so nice to be ahead of the United States, you know, time-wise, it just makes

599
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
all the difference in the world.

600
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,280
Of course, it does bring me back to my 16 hour days because around 4 p.m. is when we kick

601
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:40,520
off the West Coast day, and that's always interesting, but, yeah, whatever.

602
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,360
Speaking of my, my blackberry, this is pretty interesting that came in, you know, this

603
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,200
thing has got me completely hooked.

604
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,800
I, by the way, I didn't take it to bed with me, so I didn't read any emails this morning

605
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,720
when I, when I woke up, I thought that would be rather rude to my bed partner.

606
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,320
But I had it in my pocket, and I'd drop Christine off at school on the way back, and

607
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,320
there was always a shitload of traffic, I was, of course, scams, skimming through all

608
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
the emails.

609
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,040
It's still a beautiful device.

610
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,520
I am totally hooked, and I am not alone in that.

611
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Do you do it every day?

612
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Yes, all day?

613
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Yes, all night.

614
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Yes.

615
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Weekends.

616
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
In the shower.

617
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
At work.

618
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
At birthday parties.

619
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Weddings.

620
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Our Memphis.

621
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Work your dog.

622
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Yes, they got the garbage.

623
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Yes, paint the house.

624
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Yes.

625
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Then you're one of the millions who suffer from blackberry titus.

626
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Huh?

627
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,240
The people at BBA, blackberry anonymous, can help.

628
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,040
Here's founder Bob Sharfleys.

629
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,080
I, I was at a control, and I knew others were as well.

630
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,080
Colt turkey was hard, but I had to do it.

631
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,840
I went back to my black rotary phone.

632
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,480
After the night sweats and diarrhea stopped, the flashback started, but I made it through.

633
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
This is one of our clients.

634
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
The Beast.

635
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Him.

636
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,480
I knew I hit rock bottom during the birth of my first son, Charlie.

637
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,480
While she was pushing, I was hitting send.

638
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,680
For some reason, she was really, really upset that during the miracle of childbirth,

639
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
I was there on my blackberry.

640
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Click, click, click in a way.

641
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,960
Treatment begins with counseling and medication.

642
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,600
Then we remove both thumbs and replace them with tiny drink umbrellas.

643
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
At first, it was very difficult getting used to having drink umbrellas.

644
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,400
But, eventually, I got used to it.

645
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,320
And now, when it rains, I just hold up my two former thumbs up in the air, and they're

646
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,920
drinking umbrellas, so they kinda keep me dry.

647
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
All those severe.

648
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,520
The people at BBA, blackberry anonymous, believe they can help.

649
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,960
You may experience withdrawal like symptoms, dry mouth, tightness of the chest, nosebleeds,

650
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,360
uncontrollable crying, and of course prolonged bleeding from the thumb holes, where there

651
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,960
are now two drink umbrellas.

652
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,960
My thumb holes have been bleeding for about a year and a half.

653
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,480
Not after some gauze and some scotch tape, and eventually stops, but very anonymous,

654
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:04,560
because who needs thumbs up?

655
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:11,680
American, that's a good stuff.

656
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,720
I was working in the West Wing late one night when I heard the gurgle of a water pack,

657
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,680
so I turned it to cheating in the counter-smoking, we said, we stuffed the chronic here.

658
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Have a talk.

659
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,680
We smoked some monster hash.

660
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,680
He was his personal stance.

661
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,560
We got completely trashed.

662
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,840
We smoked some monster hash, recording in the White House, living dead, mouse red,

663
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,800
and house red, young Republicans, strict and screened.

664
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:51,760
Want somebody please, pass the vasine, they smoked some monster hash, who changed

665
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:59,760
his personal stance, they were all smashed, they smoked some monster hash, the conduits

666
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,600
choking on a bamboo fall, as Kroth said, don't over there, pass the lawn, roughing

667
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,000
with his belly, shaking too fast, it would have a hoppin to the block that I twisted.

668
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,040
The scene was rocking as chicken hogs moved, the undead marching bands, dancing all

669
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,920
grooves, backing the kitchen, muck a brown baked, some heck of a job rannys, cookies and

670
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:29,720
cakes, we ate some monster hash, we had the White House smash, we had the White House

671
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:37,440
we all got trashed, we ate some monster hash, party with a gun on to we all passed down,

672
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,160
just then we heard a blood curdling shout, watch out, beware, cover your knees, roasts

673
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,280
got the munchies and he's totally red, he smoked some monster hash, he was completely

674
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:59,680
trashed, that's been Dr. Smash, he smoked some monster hash, now every net the Democrats

675
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,600
rushed from the grave, to our taking our happening, T.H.C.R.A. for you, the Liberals, this

676
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,520
hash was meant to, when you get to my door, tell him, but it's too sexy, we'll smoke some

677
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:20,920
monster hash, we'll all get trashed, from my personal stance, we'll smoke some monster

678
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:31,880
hash, this is a good step, it's just how I can't crowded, we'll sum up in Bobby, now my

679
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:41,160
joint, how to divide it, give me a cup, I can barely give my legs, it's just a set of

680
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:57,440
that way, let me know, we had worse America, the lands, monster hash, if only that smoke

681
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:05,840
some monster hash there, maybe we have some, oh my goodness, scared in the Gmail as the

682
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,840
crap will keep wanting to reboot here, Lorna Dune, hey Adam, so I'm walking around China,

683
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,680
Chinatown in downtown LA on the Saturday morning, catching up on my podcast, listening

684
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,560
to DSC 267 on my iPod, see what I'm standing next to me, but there's a girl talking

685
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,560
furtively, furtively into an eye river doing a sound seeing tour of Chinatown, too

686
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,640
cool, I think this podcast thing is catching on, best regards from LA, I'm Lorna Dune,

687
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,680
cool Lorna, send wirelessly by a blackberry from T mobile, another, this is a cool email

688
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,000
that I got, hey Adam, as you've been talking much about all the all things porn on the

689
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,360
DSC, what does that mean, I thought you might find this video cast I found by accident,

690
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,920
no really, so basically it's this lovely chick called Miss Kitka, she goes running to

691
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,600
be doing people and talking about porn, they also talk about what I think you've been calling

692
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,680
personal porn, as always you're right on the money, really well cut together, very funny

693
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,440
and sexy at the same time, yeah, I'd actually check that out and I subscribe to it,

694
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:09,080
at least I'm subscribed in the condo, my private porn palace, misskitka.com, Mike

695
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:18,840
Sierra, Kilo, India, Tango, Kilo, Alpha.com, it is, you know, I really still don't know

696
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,960
where this is all kind of fitting all these video cast other than some of them, I really, really

697
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,760
enjoy, but you definitely have to take time for it, hey I got in touch with the Tiki Bar crew too,

698
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I love what they're doing, that's just the more great ways to communicate your message, whatever it is,

699
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,760
let me see how to sense sale message here, I've been receiving a lot of feedback on that, let's see,

700
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,200
this is about that free sense sale offer, you mentioned the free sense sale offer,

701
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,000
I looked it up and sent them a picture of my trash coffee pot to get a free sense sale, plus shipping

702
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,000
and on the form they say, how did you find out about sense sale, and this is from Chris,

703
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,400
and you said, from Adam Curry's podcast, that's sourcecode.com,

704
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,360
I must say, I really should get a sense sale at the condo because I do miss it,

705
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,280
particularly now that this morning, our cattle went on the Fritz, our hot water boiler,

706
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,640
because we drink a lot of tea around, around the cottage, so I resorted back to the sense sale,

707
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,800
it was really nice, oh man, as much as I wish they would advertise, and then I got the message

708
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:37,800
by the way, because I think my disappointment got through to the agency and turns out that

709
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,640
they're definitely not going to be doing anything in podcast, we just kind of weird, you know,

710
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,680
what an obvious place to start, you know, and they're going to be doing some more mainstream advertising.

711
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,840
Geez, geez, I mean, listen to this, listen what you could be a part of.

712
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,960
Adam, my name's Graham, I just thought I sent a sale, so I thought I'd send you a bit of audio feedback,

713
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,840
I didn't want to send a sale, I don't need one, but suddenly, you know, with all your

714
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,640
in-sacent marketing, I found myself drawn to them in supermarkets and constantly looking

715
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,960
up on the internet, trying to do some price, so I bought one, it's arrived today, so I'm going to

716
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,880
have a crack with it now, and let you know what I think, and it better be good for you also.

717
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,400
Okay, so I've unpacked it and flushed it, and it's heating up at the moment, I think I'm going to

718
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,760
be talking about some new cups, and I think it's a big of a moment, because I'm really fit under

719
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,680
there a lot while. Smells pretty good, I've got the medium roast pops, so so far, I don't know,

720
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,200
you know, things are looking pretty good, we didn't go off in a very good start as a delivery guy

721
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,840
delivered it while I was in the shower, it's always the way, isn't it? But I think our future together

722
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:44,680
could be pretty good, I mean, it's unsafe. Okay, I'm just trying to calculate whether

723
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:51,400
the dam pot goes in, pots, pot is in position, lid is on, press in the button,

724
00:23:51,720 --> 00:24:09,720
yeah, I have a half cup of it, I've been seeing a nice creme of air thawing, this is

725
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,840
you know, so far, I'm fairly impressed. Okay, I think he's done.

726
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,720
Sensei, yeah, it tastes pretty good out of, I think I say it from this one, so thanks very much for

727
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:34,600
the recommendation. Hey, now, I was listening to that, Graham's Graham Sensei machine has like a

728
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,320
second gear, maybe I have an old model, mine does not, and he, his went like,

729
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,160
three gears actually, shoot man, let me get that back for a second, hold on, let me see if I can

730
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,040
say what I do that, yeah, hold on, let me just, my name's Graham, I'm hot guy. Hey, listen to it,

731
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,880
I'm okay. Hey, listen to that second gear, it is on, he hits the first gear, right, that's what

732
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,600
mine sounds like, and then it goes a little softer, right, exactly the way mine sounds. Now,

733
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:10,200
listen, listen to what happens now, I have coffee, here comes, yeah, oh, oh my god, it's turbocharged.

734
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,920
The hell is that? Oh, man, they've done some kind of improvements without telling me.

735
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,040
Interesting. Of course, the sad thing is, is that when Sensei will finally

736
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,280
gets around advertising and actually sending me money for doing this, everyone's going to hate it.

737
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:38,920
It's so funny. I've gotten so many, so many comments about advertising. Hey, yeah, it's real

738
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,640
simple, you know, it's real simple. We have to figure out ways to make it interesting and entertaining

739
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,320
and it has to pertain to the podcast that you're listening to. That seems like a no-brainer. And by the

740
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,000
way, that's, I was thinking about, I've been thinking about a lot of things. I gotta tell you about the

741
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:06,360
items thing, too. Unlike web logs and other types of internet advertising, the power that you can

742
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,760
have. Let me see, so we have, for instance, an advertiser who has this, no, man, I don't even

743
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,480
know if I can talk about it. No, I'm going to, it's not going to be advertising on my show,

744
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,000
and I don't know the name of the product, but it's basically like a low jack for dogs and

745
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:31,960
crackberry. And, you know, so what do we do? Is we, what is that? We actually, I got to see what the hell

746
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,000
is going on. There's something here. There's a message from somebody who's sending me a message.

747
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:45,400
Oh, PW. Oh, cool. Yeah, PW is using, uh, he's doing a disaster run today. So he's, um, he's doing an

748
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,840
entire, what if, uh, power, what if a hurricane hits and power goes out, then how do we get stuff, uh,

749
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:57,480
to serious? He's doing the only, uh, you know, uh, complete mobile setup. Anyway, uh, where was I?

750
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,480
Okay, um, so the low jack for dogs, right? Uh, so that will be advertised on podcasts about,

751
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,600
guess what, dogs, and uh, and animal podcasts. So that makes a lot of sense. You know, it comes to

752
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,080
the broader stuff. That's where people get a little, um, little flaky, and, you know, how does

753
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,360
senseo pertain to you? Maybe you didn't know about it. Do you want it? You know, even,

754
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,040
well, Jarred George Carlin said it, you know, um, he's sick and tired of, oh, they're going to

755
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,600
make a Windows computer again, wanting to restart. He says he's a sick and tired of, I should look

756
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,360
up that. Where's the, just a George Carlin quote, hold on. Why am I even trying to,

757
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:42,680
Carlin, George Carlin? Let's see if this is it. Uh, hold on. Let me put it up here.

758
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,760
Let's listen, see if this is, I don't want to paraphrase the man, you know. Please,

759
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,880
save me from people who've been told what to like and then like. There you go, that's it.

760
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,520
In my opinion, if you're over six years of age and you're still getting your music from the

761
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:04,200
radio, something is desperately wrong with you. I can only hope that somehow MP3 players and

762
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,760
file sharing will destroy FM radio the way they're destroying record companies. Then, even though

763
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,520
the air will probably never be safe to breathe again, maybe it will be safer to listen to.

764
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,160
Right. So somehow that also, that pertains to music in, in that context, but somehow it also

765
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:27,480
pertains to advertising. So still a lot to work on, still a lot to think about. And also,

766
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,200
we have, now it's necessary if we want, if we wanted to work the way I envision it, then there's

767
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:39,080
got to be some kind of money flowing somehow. Okay, uh, remind me iTunes, got to talk about that.

768
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,480
First, let's go back. Backtracks podcast. So you think you know you're hit backwards and forwards?

769
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:53,160
Yeah, by now. You know what? Yeah, right. You're listening to the backtracks podcast exclusively

770
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,600
on the daily source code with Adam Curry. Hey, Adam. Hey, how you doing? Let's get right into

Definitely Michael Jackson. Okay, here are the answers. Number one.

776
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah. Got it. The politics of dancing.

777
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm here's number two.

778
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
That was entirely too easy this year.

779
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

780
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,080
Number three.

781
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,040
Okay. Oh, no, it's, uh, yeah, it's Michael Jackson.

782
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,160
Rockwell.

783
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,040
Somebody's watching me.

784
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,600
So how did you do Adam? Well, like to an add about a three. Thanks for joining us on this week's

785
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,520
backtracks podcast quiz. You can visit backtracks podcast on the web at

786
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,280
backtrackspodcast.com. Catch you next time. Backtracks podcast.

787
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,240
That is so well produced. Every single time I hear it, it's got, um, love it, fantastic.

788
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,480
And once again, I'm just enjoying the valve processor. God, I got to get another one of those.

789
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,720
Oh, I even got email. Someone sent me, you know, said, you know, the show just doesn't sound

790
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,200
to snappy as it usually do. It's not, not the, not the content, but somehow there's something

791
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,760
that just isn't snappy. Yeah, that's right. You, whoo, boy, do I miss that? Uh,

792
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,320
makes such a difference. This is the conversation I continuously have with Casplaster Mike.

793
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,880
It's so important to be able to hear the compression to hear what you're doing for me at least.

794
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,160
And this is only for me as just, you know, and I think, but I think a lot of, no, you know what,

795
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,120
you have to listen to what the listener is going to hear. That's why you have to hear the final

796
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,000
and recorded signal as it's going to come back through these little ear buds into someone's

797
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,680
noggin. You know, that's really what you have to hear. Because that's how you can only then

798
00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:00,680
can you really create the med scientist. Okay. What do I have here? 17 minutes. Okay. I tunes.

799
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:06,120
I finally figured something out. This is also for Matt at Pod Show, who does all our insertion orders

800
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,960
and the tracking, et cetera. I figured out there's been something really weird going on. Where

801
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:19,640
one day we saw thousands of downloads just disappear from the daily source code. And

802
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,320
the subscriptions didn't diminish. That was the crazy thing is that the subscription number was still

803
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,240
the same. Only there were thousands less downloads. I'm like, how is this possible? And, you know,

804
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,440
we're like looking at our log files, we're trying to figure it out. And it hit me this morning.

805
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,400
All of a sudden, I figured it out. In iTunes, if you subscribe to Podcast, but you don't listen to,

806
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,840
I think it's five episodes, then it will automatically stop downloading and give you a little

807
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,960
explanation mark next to the podcast. Haha. So that would be it. Because of course, you know,

808
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,000
when daily source code is featured or when, you know, for some reason people hear about it,

809
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,560
particularly through iTunes, then, you know, thousands of people subscribe on the same day.

810
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,360
And if they stop listening to it, then it won't, well, it doesn't unsubscribe now because it still

811
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,840
goes and checks the feed. And through our relationship, I know how many subscribers I have through

812
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,440
iTunes, which, by the way, is not a service. They, you know, it should be a service. You should be

813
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,280
able to log in and find out how many subscribers you have. But it's not a service that's opened

814
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,960
everybody, which is a whole nother topic of conversation. But that's really interesting because

815
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:39,240
that really does keep the whole model very fair. So that you don't have advertisements going out

816
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,040
that are just sitting around the someone's iTunes and not being listened to. So actually,

817
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,040
although it sucks because, you know, like, wow, man, all of a sudden what happened to my

818
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:54,760
listenership, you know, there's like a percent dropage or something. Now I think I figured it out.

819
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:01,960
So the key is, is to, well, it's to keep marketing because that's what it is. It'd be, and of

820
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,760
course, iPod or lemon, I think, doesn't do that. You can probably set that as a default. I wonder,

821
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,760
I wonder how that's going to be. But it does seem like a very fair way to do it. You know,

822
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,360
if you're just so that you're, and it's also, it's not just fair for reporting purposes,

823
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:24,280
but also fair for for bandwidth purposes. I mean, shit, if you're not listening to the show,

824
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,760
stop downloading it, please, you know, that, that actually costs money. Although, you know,

825
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,640
since it sends teams per download, it's still costs money. So I just wanted to, she had that

826
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,040
brain fart with you. That's all. Hey Adam, this is PD Love, Everett Lovehouse Radio, and you mentioned

827
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,800
your show last week about not having heard a DJ speak about a song, whether they liked it or not

828
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,520
for the past 15 or 20 years. And it made me think back to a specific occurrence,

829
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,160
that was exactly 15 years ago, back in the summer of 1990. One of my favorite artists is

830
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,560
Jude Colt. I don't know if you've ever heard of Jude, but I was really turned on to him back in

831
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,320
that summer, and it was actually because of a local DJ here named Lisa McKay on the local

832
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,680
pop station. She worked the three to six shift. I guess the evening drive shift. And when she

833
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,560
first started her show, and when she ended her show every day for about a month that seemed,

834
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,000
she would mention how much she liked that song and liked that artist, Jude Colt, and the song was

835
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,160
Baby It's Tonight. And she'd play it, and then just kind of started sticking to me, and eventually

836
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:31,160
I bought the CD, listened to it every day through my senior year of college, as well as forcing

837
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,080
our roommates to listen to it, and it became kind of our anthem. We've spread the Jude as I put

838
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,080
it to a lot of people, but just wanted to give you that. That was about kind of a specific that,

839
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,240
yeah, it has been that long since I've heard a DJ really turned me on to music.

840
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,480
Until, of course, now with the podcasting and Brother Love and all the great artists on the

841
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,920
PMN, but just wanted to share that with you if you get a chance to listen to it, and check out Jude,

842
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,040
Jude Colt.com. He's got a recording studio out with Keith for Sutherland out in LA, so maybe they

843
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,880
can help out a little bit with the unlabel and some of these groups you're putting together,

844
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,200
or whatever's going on with that. So, again, just wanted to share that with you, keep your real

845
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,640
talk to you later. Peter Love. Thank you very much, my friend. Yeah. Well,

846
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,240
there you go. It's all this, this PMN is we're calling it the Podsafe Music Network.

847
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,920
So many suggestions. Even comic strip blogger offered his version of suggestions on the comments

848
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,880
for the Daily Source Code entry for last Friday. Of course, it didn't the typical comic strip blogger

849
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,280
way, which is completely rude in your face, but improvements definitely coming, and you know,

850
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,920
I think we have a real good idea now of how this thing is finally being used. I am,

851
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,560
well, it's kind of like the site that is almost now my default homepage, and I was looking for

852
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Christmas use music, and I found some.

853
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:28,600
People are shopping for the loved ones, and making plans for Christmas Feast,

854
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:42,920
but it all goes by in the blink of an eye, and then we have to wait another year.

855
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:56,200
But what if every day would Christmas? What a wonderful world this would be?

856
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:10,600
We would never feel blue. We may call our dreams come true if Christmas or every day.

857
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:28,120
This time brings out the good in people. Just look around now and you'll see.

858
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:41,960
Everybody is nice and full of life and they give to those who are in need.

859
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:56,200
But if every day would Christmas? What a wonderful world this would be?

860
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:10,760
We would never feel blue. We may call our dreams come true if Christmas or every day.

861
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:28,920
So throughout the year, from the summer to the spring, I'll take you, time cheered, until then it's Christmas again.

862
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:42,200
But what if every day would Christmas? What a wonderful world this would be?

863
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:56,200
We would never feel blue. We may call our dreams come true if Christmas or every day.

864
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:15,960
We would never feel blue. We may call our dreams come true if Christmas or every day.

865
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:23,640
Oh man, I just had another one of those big haired fact, the brainfarts. That was slow.

866
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Every day we're Christmas from the pod save music network. I love this song.

867
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,000
And as I was listening to it, I was thinking to myself, this is the perfect song. This is like

868
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,200
We are the world. Do they know it's Christmas time by bandaid? Here's a thought. Here's something

869
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,640
we could, it would be very, very cool to do. Not trivial. But what if we got a whole bunch of

870
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,640
pod save music artists to cut, you know, just like a USA for Africa, we are the world in

871
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:03,400
like bandaid. And I can almost hear, brother love doing a bit. I can hear. I can't even come

872
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,200
up with the name of the list. There's so many different pod save music artists. Wouldn't it be

873
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:16,600
cool if we did that? So I'm thinking maybe Slow can release the tracks or, yeah, I don't know what

874
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,160
he's recorded it on. And then maybe we can have someone who is like the producer and then

875
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,800
everyone record their own version and then send it into one central spot and then the producer

876
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,160
could mix it out and could turn it into this huge, beautiful pod save music Christmas song

877
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,160
with just tons of pod save music artists. Anyone, basically wants to participate. Shit, we could

878
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,640
have 15 different versions of this. Think about how powerful that would be. And then we could even

879
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:48,200
go so far as to register it with ASCAP BMI with ASCAP or whatever or BMI. And whenever it's played

880
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,080
on the in the traditional media, which it will, I really truly believe if we make a great

881
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:59,560
ass song, we can get it distributed by a record label and we could give away the proceeds

882
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:06,040
to whatever charity we decide on. Perhaps Hurricane victims would be an interesting one. Of course

883
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,400
that's not a global issue. Well, in a way it is. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Think about

884
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:19,480
how cool that would be. So I'm just thinking maybe you'll do that. Oh my god, that would be

885
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:28,120
so cool. Okay, staying on the PMN for a second. What's up Adam? How's it going? My name's Jay Mac.

886
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:35,720
I've been a listener for a few months and you inspired me to start my own podcast, Hip Hop Podcast,

887
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:42,760
which I produce. We got a host for and everything. And then what we ended up doing was because

888
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,200
the Hip Hop, it's really hard to reach people simply on the internet. We do get a lot, but it's

889
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,000
not enough. So what we did is we hit the streets with, you know, flyers. We started our own little

890
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,600
street team with people just in Michigan right now. We got people into Troy Lansing and Flint,

891
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,520
Michigan and then we're spreading out to the Chicago area. And it's working really well. We're

892
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:13,160
getting a lot of artists, submissions, and stuff. But the problem we're having is, you know, a lot

893
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,040
of artists don't necessarily have internet access or, you know, they don't, they don't mess with the

894
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:25,000
internet much. So what we want to do is, you know, they can't submit themselves into the pod safe

895
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,040
music network, but we want to get them in there for the extra exposure. Anybody who are bringing

896
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,680
in is definitely unsigned and an underground artist. So I guess my question is, is there,

897
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,680
is there a way to bulk some artists to the pod safe music network? Because we have several artists

898
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,200
to put in there into the database, but, you know, it's, it's cumbersome to create an account for

899
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,680
each and every artist that we bring in because we're talking, you know, I mean, we bring in new artists

900
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,160
every week. So I'm hoping there's some way that we can streamline the process for us to be able

901
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,960
to put artists into the pod safe music network system without necessarily having to create an

902
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,920
account on their behalf, you know, under us. So anyway, I'd like to hear what you have to say about it,

903
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,440
get some feedback. And, you know, if there's anything we can do to make that work, let me know,

904
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,640
appreciate your time. Thanks. Yeah, Jim Mac for hoodhyped.com. Yeah, actually, that's a very good point.

905
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:29,480
And I think particularly in hip hop, you'll see that it's difficult to motivate the artist to get

906
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,720
there. You know, there's a traditional way of getting hip hop out there. And that's basically

907
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,600
by playing a really loud in your car and then getting picked up for distribution deal, you know,

908
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,600
through some sub-label, like a PDD or something like that, or, you know, Russell Simmons, or any

909
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,160
just countless of small Indies who have big label distribution deals. That's kind of the path that

910
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,320
you take, which, of course, is very limited. So we've done something to address this because

911
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,640
not only does this happen in hip hop, it happens. I guess artists in general across the board are,

912
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,600
and this is not from, you know, I've heard this from our performers themselves, that lazy.

913
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:10,840
So that's not my opinion, but it does seem to kind of ring true. And what we've done,

914
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,640
you know, we've enabled a number of podcasters to quit their day job, drew from Dawn and Drew.

915
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,160
Well, we're kind of with Mad Schweins, you know, though, she still manages the girl band.

916
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,000
There's just a number of them, which were very proud of by the way. It's very cool to be able to offer

917
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,400
people that. So one of the people who have, who's quit their day job is Michael Butler,

918
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,520
the Rock and Roll Geek of the Rock and Roll Geek Show, Rock and Roll Geek.com.

919
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,520
And he'll be coming into, I think it's, I don't know if he starts this week or next week,

920
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,800
but he'll, he's actually not just going to continue doing the Rock and Roll Geek Show,

921
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:52,040
he's also going to be working at the pod show headquarters. And his primary job will be

922
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:58,760
getting artists into the pod safe music network, which is fantastic. So I'll make sure that he

923
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,240
reaches out to you and there's a, you know, connect there so that you can, you guys can figure it out

924
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,080
away to facilitate that. That's just going to be very, very cool. And that's exactly what is needed, I think,

925
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:16,040
to really build up our, our database of, of pod safe songs. And in the future, I think that it

926
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:21,560
really is true that artists and bands will become, you know, one-man companies. It's already happening

927
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,880
that way. You know, you have to have your website. You've got to, you've got to get your merchandise,

928
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,840
which you get either through Zazzle or Cafe Press or, you know, with any other number of websites,

929
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,840
you've got, you do your, you, in many cases, you accept bookings through, for example, my space

930
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,880
and there were a lot of, a lot of pod safe music artists get, get bookings through my space.com,

931
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,800
uploading stuff into different places, such as the pod safe music network. There's a lot of work that

932
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,280
goes along with that. I know, I see what the listivious biddies do, man. It's like a full-time gig

933
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,520
and they still work. All kinds of tempting jobs to, you know, basic, hey, biddies, you know,

934
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,760
speaking of speaking of such, since you guys are on the road roaming around, why don't we hook

935
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,920
up with a biodiesel or something that's cheaper? You know, you're always renting vans. Maybe we

936
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,600
can get a bit of bitty mobile together. Hey, and all you have to do is just take some of the

937
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,520
vegetable oil from wherever you play and, you know, pour it in the tank and you're good to go.

938
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:24,760
Which reminds me, I think we've decided on the car. Because like, when I came home yesterday,

939
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,760
we were talking about it, because, well, you know, basically I saw our old car. So, oh shit,

940
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,040
yeah, I got to take care of that by the end of the end of the year. I promised to get rid of it.

941
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,840
And fucking windows. No, don't restart now and don't ask me again.

942
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,320
So, I was talking to Patricia and I said, well, there's so many different cars,

943
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,280
make some models and types. And, you know, what do you want to get? I don't think we should

944
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,320
get such a big car because we're really not going to use it. She said, that can be any car.

945
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,640
You know, I like all kinds of cars. As long as it's a Jaguar,

946
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,440
there what? Yeah, as long as it's a Jaguar. And notice my

947
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,320
correct pronunciation, not Jaguar. Jaguar Jaguar is a Jaguar.

948
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,800
Okay. So, we looked at a couple of Jags online at Jaguar.co.uk. And apparently,

949
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:19,000
this, you've got a, the S type, which is not the, it's not really super sexy, but the, the S,

950
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:26,840
the Jag S type has a 2.7 liter diesel engine. So, if anyone has any experience with the Jag,

951
