1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Actually, I got a message for all you old school radio cats out there who are going, what the hell

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,240
is this?

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,400
You see, this ain't clear channel robot radio, spineless, big looking like a motherfuckin

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,680
sanitized, no guts, no glory, edgedless boring my ass off, pathetic copycat, pastie butt

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,240
think you're so hot shit, pantyweight shitty same shukira song playing, Ryan C. Christ

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,640
hosted Coldplay Worshping M&M mixed into an all-rock format YouTube-flating Lincoln Park

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,560
and Limp Bizkit-Poser angry douchebag playing, your trash want to be trend-following

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,640
solace, rush-lim-boss indicating Howard Stern canceling, fucked-tard encouraging lowest

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,600
common denominator, sonic shit spewing waste to the airwaves that ever pissed off the broadcast

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,080
equivalent of a moldy white bread shit sandwich with pale advertising dollars for

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,840
lettuce that you'll force feed down the mouth of every hick, local, and hayseed that

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,040
lives in cowfuck town USA where you own every fucking radio station in the region so that

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,040
you can continue to shove your tongue up the ass of whatever bullshit right wing candidate

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,040
is running for Senate, Congress or dog catcher who give you more licenses so you can spread

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,440
your cancerous disease field, pussin-crusted, mucus-dripping, scab, jambalaya that you

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,440
call your fucking programming, so welcome to the future everybody, welcome to podcasting

20
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:34,440
I don't care what anyone thinks about me

21
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm not afraid of what you say or do it doesn't hurt me

22
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Then you say I'm going to be doing all well and feeling like I should

23
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,440
I'm really, really glad I'm really, really, really happy and I'm really good

24
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm really, really glad I'm really, really, really happy and I'm really, really, really happy

25
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I'm really, really, really happy just like me

26
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Hey everybody, how you doing is the Daily Source Code episode number 300 and I have absolutely nothing planned for the today

27
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,440
For tonight's episode the only thing I could really come up with was just the opening

28
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Last night as I was snuggled up in my bed here in the condo

29
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,440
I flipped on Pacific Coast Hellway episode 142 and I heard that rant

30
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
And I almost couldn't sleep after it

31
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,440
More particularly because Mark Yoshimura Namcoff was up at the office today

32
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,440
He came up from California from Los Angeles

33
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:03,440
The land of Hollywood, he came up to Valleywood and I actually told him I said man, that's the best rant I've heard in a long, long time

34
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Probably the best show I've ever heard from Pacific Coast Hellway

35
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,440
That's a perfect way to kick off today's celebratory episode

36
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
What is 300 really?

37
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Isn't that like a cardboard celebration or does that fall under aluminium foil?

38
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Oh, did you hear that? I said aluminium foil and not aluminum

39
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,440
That's the UK rubbing off on me

40
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Yeah, so of course the muffs with a very, very happy because I am happy even though I'm dead tired

41
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
I can't tell you

42
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
So just one more night here in the condo

43
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Then I'm back home, back with the girls, we're going to celebrate the holidays

44
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,440
And I probably won't be back until the end of the first or the second week of January

45
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,440
So I'll be back on a different time schedule

46
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
I'm just tripping out over the jet lag this time

47
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
It didn't work out very well

48
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,440
So today, lots of stuff to talk about

49
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,440
Even though nothing specific to 300 episodes

50
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Maybe we'll celebrate the 500th episode

51
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
It'll be what maybe 7 months from now

52
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,440
So let's say July, maybe August, something like that

53
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,440
And that'll be something we can really, we'll put on a show

54
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I don't know, we'll do something cool for the 500th anniversary of the daily source code

55
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,440
So for today, we're just going to crank out through a couple of things

56
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,440
One thing that I've really been enjoying recently

57
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,440
is listeners sending me or fans basically

58
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Send me links to bands pages on the Podsake Music Network

59
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Please do that more often

60
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,440
I mean, you know what I like, you know, as listeners, you're hearing the songs

61
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,440
You may be skipping past songs, you may think I'm totally misguided

62
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,440
But feel free to send me a link to something that you think is really, really good

63
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Because I'm constantly looking from music

64
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,440
And by now, there's so many tracks in the Podsake Music Network

65
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,440
I go in and I look at what's been submitted during the day

66
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
That's sometimes 50 tracks, you know

67
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
So there's no time to really listen to everything

68
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,440
So as you know, I hunt around and listen to other podcasters

69
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,440
But I'd love to hear from you guys what if you have anything

70
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I see lots of people are telling me that they're bringing friends into the networks

71
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Hey, you know, you should put your stuff on the Podsake Music Network

72
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
And send me a link and if I don't play it, you know, don't get all pissed off for anything

73
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,440
I still got to kind of like it myself, I guess

74
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Otherwise it might as well go work for the man, you know

75
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Lots of feedback as well about the story I told about the motorcycle accident that I had

76
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,440
I guess I don't know why so many people are surprised that I used to ride

77
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Or like this email from Eric Lickness

78
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Man, the story about the motorcross

79
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Wow, how did you ever not kill yourself?

80
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I've given more respect for you than I had before

81
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Oh helicopter's fixed wing and MX

82
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
That's sense for motorcross, my God

83
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
No wonder you were also into cars for a while

84
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,440
You love fast things and I've ever figured you for a gear head

85
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,440
But it all makes sense, the interesting technology in horse power

86
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
It's all part of a continuum

87
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Well, you know what the fast stuff

88
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
I'm not really always been into fast cars

89
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
I've had...

90
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
That's actually Patricia's been into fast cars

91
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
She had a Porsche 911, that was nice

92
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,440
I drove that for a while, but it wasn't, you know, a 911

93
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,440
A late 80s 911 is when we had it

94
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
It late 80s early 90s

95
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
And it had manuals, stick shift

96
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
And that thing was like shifting a truck

97
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,440
I've had, you know, a Ford Explorer

98
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
I had a Rolls Royce, that was nice for a while

99
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
I drove it into New York City every single day

100
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
It was like having a force field around you

101
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
She guys, they used to have those back in the day

102
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
You come out of Lincoln Tunnel

103
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Coming in from Jersey and they'd be squeegee guys

104
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
And they immediately just start putting their dirty ass nasty water

105
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
And squeegee it off for your windshield

106
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
And then they'd stand there and wait for you to give them a buck

107
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
So, and most commuters into New York

108
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Wouldn't want, you know, nothing to do with it

109
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
And, you know, they'd honk or they'd turn on the windshield

110
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Wipers to indicate, please don't touch my car

111
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
And I wouldn't even have to do that

112
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
These guys would look at me and they'd say

113
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Oh, my brother, I wouldn't touch the car

114
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
But why don't you give me a dollar for the thought

115
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Which, of course, I gladly did

116
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Fantastic, the force field of the Rolls

117
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
That was nice

118
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Good times, good times

119
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,440
And so, yeah, the Audi wasn't the A8

120
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Studio A8 actually

121
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
That wasn't for the speed of it

122
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
But it was just a very safe car

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
I had to do a lot of traveling

124
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
It was just the right car at the time

125
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
I like to get things that are right for the mission

126
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,440
You know, right now, the Charlie 1802RG, the Sessna

127
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
It's the perfect plane for the mission

128
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
I don't need anything else, you know, yeah

129
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I could get twin engines and get my rating for that

130
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
You can get jets, you can do whatever you want

131
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,440
But, you know, I like getting the right machine for the mission

132
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
And, clearly, the motorcycle accident

133
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Was the wrong machine for the mission

134
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
And for my experience

135
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Some exciting news from Google

136
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
If now launched the Google Music Search

137
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Which I checked out

138
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
And it works great

139
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
What a fantastic way to drive music sales

140
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Now, here's where our investors, our Silicon Valley investors

141
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Investors are just fantastic to have

142
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
I fired off a note to one of our board of director members

143
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Now, as you know, we have pretty much the same team

144
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
That invested initially in Google

145
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,440
And I fired off a note, I said, you know, wow

146
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,440
This is perfect, we need to get the pot safe music network index

147
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
And, you know, when people go searching from music

148
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,440
They'll be able to find it and go straight to the websites

149
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Into the PMN sites and so now I've got to hook up with in Google

150
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
And I'm going to be working on it

151
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I don't see why they wouldn't do it

152
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Our board member, Ram seemed really excited

153
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
He thought it was a great idea

154
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
So, wow, just think of all the more exposure

155
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,440
We can get for pots to be made

156
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
And I hope that I don't see why they wouldn't do it

157
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Our board member, Ram seemed really excited

158
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
He thought it was a great idea

159
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Wow, just think of all the more exposure

160
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
We can get for pot safe music

161
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
And how easy it'll be for people to find it

162
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
If you hear of a name or if you hear something

163
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
You can just go into Google Music Search and find it

164
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
And it'll have all the music there

165
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
And all the information categorize

166
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I guess they take a

167
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Some kind of, it's probably an XML feed

168
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Or some way to store it into their database

169
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
It's definitely structured data

170
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,440
So, whatever they want, we will obviously make that available

171
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
That's going to be extremely cool

172
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Daily source code, episode number 300

173
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
It seems almost like yesterday doesn't it?

174
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,440
This is the moment where I actually go into it

175
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
I should play some old clips

176
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I should have played episode number one

177
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Yeah, yeah, Karamba

178
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,440
You're a producer for this show, man

179
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Hey, Adam, it's Derek Miller from the Penn Machine podcast

180
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,440
at podcast.penmachine.com again

181
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,440
I wanted to congratulate Slaw on getting

182
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
If every day we're Christmas into that

183
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Westwood one radio network

184
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
And WR radio in New York

185
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,440
And we managed to get it on CBC here in Canada too

186
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
One thing I want to bring up is

187
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
I'm not sure if you've noticed this new

188
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Google Music Search service

189
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,440
You can go to it at google.com

190
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Slash Music Search

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Interesting thing about it is you can search for artists

192
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,440
And if you search for an artist in Google

193
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,440
It pops up with music results at the top

194
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
You can go see albums and lyrics

195
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Interestingly enough, even those lyric sites

196
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
The R.I.W.A. is going after

197
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,440
But I did notice that it doesn't consider

198
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Podsake music at all

199
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
If you look for a brother, a lot of you will find

200
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Brother Love in the iTunes Music Store

201
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
But you won't find his Podsake music network listings

202
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
He won't find Slaw, he won't find anybody else

203
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
His Podsake

204
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,440
So maybe we better get on Google about that

205
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
What do you say?

206
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
I think so

207
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I'm looking forward to show number 300

208
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Right

209
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,440
So if I want a radio station at this very moment

210
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
The phone which would be to the right

211
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Left of me would have a little red button on it

212
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
A special line it would be blinking

213
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
And that's called the hot line

214
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
I would pick that up during a record

215
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
And it would be the program director

216
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Basically the boss saying

217
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
You know I'm at curry curry man

218
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
You fucking idiot man

219
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
You screwed up the bit man

220
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
You're supposed to play the feedback first

221
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
And then talk about the Google Investor thing

222
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Shmuck

223
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
But then of course it'd be on the radio

224
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Okay, Derek you totally motivated me

225
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
So I'm done

226
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
I immediately acted upon it

227
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I mean how cool is that

228
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
The Google Music Search comes out

229
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
I get a feedback about it

230
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I fire off an email to

231
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
One of the original Google Investor

232
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
In fact, Ram was

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
You know pre venture capital bun

234
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
He was like an angel investor man

235
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
And

236
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Immediately there's a connection

237
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
That is true power

238
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
All right everybody

239
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Feel free to sing along

240
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
You're gonna be here in this tune

241
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
A lot in the future

242
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
I don't see

243
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Has fallen for

244
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Trinity

245
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
A car with her

246
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
If you'll be in style

247
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
If you take her out

248
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
On the miracle mile

249
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Her stunning sexy yellow you

250
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
A handcrank son

251
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Move one of you

252
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
An extra cylinder

253
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Can give you likely one

254
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Point two five times

255
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Feel like it's in

256
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Yeah

257
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Trinity

258
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Trinity

259
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,440
A quintessential luxury

260
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh

261
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Trinity

262
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Trinity

263
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,440
By a diesel industry

264
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
She could talk

265
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
You hear her thank

266
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Adam for pooping in her tank

267
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Oh

268
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Trinity

269
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Trinity

270
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Trinity

271
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Trinity

272
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Trinity

273
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Trinity

274
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Trinity

275
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
It's so good

276
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Everybody

277
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
So that's almost perfect

278
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Jeffrey Smith

279
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Thank you very much

280
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
I love the Trinity theme song

281
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
That of course

282
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Will for the foreseeable future

283
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Mark a small discussion

284
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
About biodiesel the bio industry

285
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
biodiesel industry

286
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
About Trinity my biodiesel beast

287
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm so excited about everything that I'm learning about this

288
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
What I really need though Jeff if you have some time

289
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I need kind of like a donut

290
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,440
We could have the the first half of the Trinity song

291
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
And then just a whole bunch of

292
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Do you do you know maybe in the background

293
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Trinity

294
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Trinity

295
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Trinity

296
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
And then it would end up with a big finish

297
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
You know I could do the whole

298
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
The whole item the whole biodiesel item in the show

299
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Could be completely packaged

300
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
It would be just beautiful

301
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
It could almost be a podcast within a podcast

302
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Quick couple of bits of feedback

303
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
From the Gmail bin from Michael Rubin

304
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
I already see this received this off from Steve way

305
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
But I haven't heard back from Steve

306
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Maybe maybe the email got lost somewhere

307
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
But I'm sure he's working on some audio feedback

308
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
He says

309
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Oh not Steve but Michael Rubin

310
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Says that he's a sales area

311
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Eris sales manager for a national auto glass repair

312
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
And replacement company

313
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
He listens to the source code

314
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Fan of podcasting working on his own podcast actually

315
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,440
I guess he oversees 300 offices

316
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
So he's a pretty busy guy

317
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,440
But he feels that a podcast for those 300 offices

318
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
would keep all the offices connected

319
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,440
And he would like to do that on a business

320
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
A level which is great

321
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
He's in St. Augustine, Florida

322
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Let's see

323
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,440
One of the classes that I teach is about windshield repair

324
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Our company repairs over 10,000 windshields

325
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Every week saving them insurance companies

326
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Saving insurance companies millions of dollars

327
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Versus the cost of replacing them

328
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
I would be happy to have our company to send out a rep

329
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Who does the same for our company

330
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,440
To help you to explain the process and perform a demonstration for your

331
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Intrinity

332
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Wow that's a great offer

333
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,440
It's not really anything that has to do with the bio diesel industry

334
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
He can per se

335
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
But he does have a pretty cool information

336
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
And you know what

337
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Let me see if Steve is able to come up in a couple of weeks

338
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
And if not a gladly take up on that offer

339
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Because we have to start

340
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Painted the bitch out

341
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
You know

342
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
We've got to represent for the bio diesel industry

343
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Email here from Peter Jardos

344
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
I guess that is

345
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Some finding Trinity, she sounds awesome

346
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
You mentioned though

347
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
That she had the necessary conversion to bio diesel

348
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
I was under the impression that ordinary diesel engines would run

349
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Bio diesel with no conversion necessary

350
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Do you know exactly what the previous owner did to convert her

351
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Do you know if was actually necessary or just makes her run better

352
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Very interested in bio diesel

353
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Wonder if there's a bio diesel podcast

354
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
I don't think I think there are

355
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Podcasts that certainly deal with bio diesel

356
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
I would be pretty gay

357
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
To participate

358
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
I don't have time to produce it

359
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,440
And we don't quite have our production company all set up yet

360
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,440
But there would just be fun to participate in it

361
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
One way or the other

362
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Maybe I could donate my Trinity segment to a bio diesel podcast

363
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
You know I really don't know

364
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Now I'm confused

365
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
It was sold to me with a bio diesel conversion on it

366
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm pretty sure it's not

367
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,440
A heating element that allows you to pour in

368
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,440
SVO or straight vegetable oil

369
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
And in fact I really don't understand

370
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
anymore I'm so confused but

371
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
I have three quarters of a tank left

372
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,440
So we'll have to wait until the second week of January

373
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
When I'm back and then of course we'll go out

374
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
We'll do a sound seeing tour of the Berkeley bio diesel

375
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Oasis and we'll learn

376
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,440
We'll learn you know basically straight from the closest source I have

377
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
And finally email from Andy

378
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
About time you got a diesel car dude

379
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,440
If you're interested in running full synthetic oil in the diesel

380
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Which will last you a whole year

381
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Please check out my website

382
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,440
With with an oil

383
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Whisky India Sierra Yankee November Oscar India Lima dot com

384
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Be interested in the best synthetic oil in filters

385
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Is that a bio diesel thing or is that just

386
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,440
I guess if it's synthetic oil then I guess it's

387
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Stuff that makes you makes us all less dependent upon the petrochemical industry

388
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Is that what it's called?

389
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
This petrochemical industry I think it is

390
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
And that's again

391
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
That's what I'm in for

392
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
I mean look at all the opportunities we have

393
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,440
We could make our automobiles run on something other than gasoline

394
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Or should I say petrol to be completely proper

395
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
So we had one theme song and you know it's not just one

396
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
The the goodness keeps on coming

397
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Maybe there is something cool about episode number 300

398
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Are you tired of going into shape in the morning?

399
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Only define that you're endlessly scraping your face with three

400
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,440
And four blade razors that just don't measure up

401
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Well more is better

402
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
So it's time for you to discover

403
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Gigashay

404
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Gigashay

405
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Gigashay is a revolutionary new shaving system from Zcast Labs

406
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Gigashay

407
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,440
The Gigashay system incorporates over a million tiny blades

408
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,440
That all act in unison to give you a close smooth shave

409
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,440
That's more than one blade for every hair on your face

410
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Gigashay

411
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,440
The patent the Gigashay system was developed at Zcast Labs

412
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,440
To ensure that all the stubble on your face could be removed

413
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
In one swift motion

414
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Ah

415
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,440
As well as sometimes other flashy o-cropping such as noses and lips

416
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,440
But your chin will be as smooth as a baby's bottom

417
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,440
So I use over a hundred strokes to shave in the morning

418
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
When you could do it in just one

419
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
With the revolutionary new

420
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Gigashay

421
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Gigashay

422
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Gigashay should be used only on the face

423
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,440
People who are distraught from a recent break-ups should not use this product

424
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
As it could cause bleeding from the wrists or jugular

425
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Keep safely out of the reach of fuzzy-lipped adolescents

426
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,440
No babies were harmed in the making of this ad

427
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
Gigashay is a registered trademark of Zcast Labs

428
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Void wear prohibited by law

429
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Oh common sense

430
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,440
So I've been setting aside portions of this daily source code podcast

431
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,440
For us men to discuss shaving

432
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,440
And for no particular reason other than I'm just kind of interested

433
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,440
It's something we all do and we really ever talk about it

434
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,440
It's not like we're hanging out at the water cooler and say hey

435
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Hey Ron dude, what you're using these days to shave your face

436
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Something guys just don't do

437
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
The women talk about the different shivers

438
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,440
If you shave your legs or other other parts of your body

439
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,440
I'm a big fan of of nair and beat by the way for all that stuff

440
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
But for the face I don't like burn in my face

441
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,440
So Jonas Nielsen said out of my took your advice

442
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,440
And bought the Wilkinson four blade to change for my mock three

443
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
What an amazing change

444
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
The difference is incredible

445
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,440
I for one advise everyone shaving with the mock three to try the Wilkinson four and see for themselves

446
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,440
By the way West Coast customs is a shop that does the pay my ride for MTV

447
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm sure that's where they told you to go for the for Trinity

448
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Absolutely

449
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,440
So I've really been you know paying attention to all this feedback that's coming in

450
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:01,440
Some people really like this M3 the mock three razor with the with the like a vibrator in it

451
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,440
That's I've seen it on sale at our local Sainsbury's which is our

452
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Supermarket nearby

453
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,440
I'll make sure that I get one to test it out

454
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,440
I really am still digging the Wilkinson four blade though

455
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,440
It's yeah, it gives a really nice close shave

456
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,440
So let me know I know that sounds incredibly lame

457
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,440
But again, I never get an opportunity to talk to other men at all about our shaving experience

458
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,440
By the way, I'll I use Gillette the Gillette gel shaving cream the foamy stuff

459
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
And I use a

460
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I use a beaver hair brush

461
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Beaver hair brush to put the shaving cream on my face

462
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,440
And let me tell you there's nothing

463
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Like nice bristly beaver hair on your face first thing in the morning

464
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Yes indeed

465
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Hey those of you listening to the show on serious stars 103

466
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,440
This show is about to end at least the put this portion for you because our satellite window is closing up

467
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Oh, man, Pete up sent me the lineup so I could sound freaking intelligent about what's coming up

468
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Hold up, let me just go to my Gmail real quick

469
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
So

470
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Oh, man

471
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
After this show it is specific coast hellway

472
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,440
By the same guys that you heard opening up episode number 300 of the daily source code

473
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Followed by

474
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,440
Magic Weinstein with yeast radio for now. These are all podcasts and you can find more information about them at podshow.com

475
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,440
And here we go, view is HTML

476
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
I've got the rest of the lineup right here

477
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,440
I know the Don and Drew come after Madge Weinstein

478
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
And it being Friday

479
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Let's see Don and Drew followed by Steve Gillmore's attention tech after that

480
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Which at all rather third with an extended five minutes with which at all and that will be followed by CC

481
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Chap and I presume it's either going to be answered hash or the you turn cafe

482
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,440
So stay tuned for all of that right here on serious satellite stars 103

483
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,440
And for the rest of you the podcast continues

484
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,440
This is where we're going to talk a little bit. Remember I talked to you about format changes

485
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
How on the source code

486
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Definitely want to do some of the more podcasting podcast community related stuff after the satellite window closes

487
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,440
So we kind of have a good mix of letting people know about you know just what we can do with podcasts

488
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,440
And also we can talk amongst ourselves once in a while in a little private area

489
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,440
So everyone listening to this podcast right now

490
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Please raise your right hand

491
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,440
And wave goodbye to all our satellite listeners

492
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Okay, there we go

493
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,440
So Google launched I don't know if it was recent but someone sent me a link today

494
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,440
A Michael Shono Michael sent me that actually

495
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Google now has a mobile version of Gmail

496
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,440
And you get to it by going to m.gmail.com

497
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Not bad actually

498
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,440
You know that I'm a big fan of the blackberry

499
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,440
Particularly because of the push email now using the blackberry browser

500
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,440
It was a pretty nice experience to be able to go to

501
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,440
My Gmail account, but there's one thing that's missing from it

502
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,440
You can't add labels and that's a really so being able to search the email is important

503
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:21,440
But being able to add a label is it's it's how I organize my thought my shit and my shit my thoughts and my shit

504
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Hold on, you might as well finish rolling it now that you're on to me

505
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,440
So that's unfortunate, I've been really, you know, the more I think about it

506
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,440
I know it's not a trivial thing because the blackberry email service is kind of a close box

507
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,440
And you can forward email to it, but you know with the blackberry with this push email

508
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,440
The beauty is when you can actually you delete something on a device

509
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
And then it also deletes in your email accounts

510
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,440
So what I'd love to have and I don't know if Gmail and Google can hook that up with the blackberry folks

511
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
I mean it seems like we're both of them

512
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,440
If I could, you know, essentially

513
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,440
When I delete something in my blackberry or if I could label something in my blackberry

514
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
That that would synchronize up to my Gmail account

515
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,440
I know it's a lot to ask for but that would, you know

516
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,440
I wouldn't need any presence for Christmas for years and years and years to come

517
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,440
If I could get that little feature implemented

518
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,440
Hey Adam, this is Glenn Garnes and I was hoping that you'd do a promo of my new podcast

519
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Addicted to Eggnog

520
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Of course I'm kidding, but probably would make a good subject for somebody's podcast

521
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Listen, actually the reason that I'm sending you this message is that I did want to talk about Eggnog for a minute

522
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,440
I've been addicted to Eggnog for years now, I absolutely love it

523
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,440
And I guess the bottom line is that I consider myself to be somewhat of a kind of sewer of Eggnog

524
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,440
I've had it from a variety of different sources including homemade and some store-bought stuff that's actually better than some other places

525
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:03,440
But I wanted to specifically tell you that if you can get your hands on a product that's made by rich foods

526
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,440
It's called Colonial Custer

527
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,440
This is an Eggnog that's just like drinking a milkshake

528
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,440
And so it's perfect if you're going to mix it with something because by the time you get something else mixed with it

529
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
It's just about the consistency that it should be

530
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,440
But if you drink it straight with nothing in it, it's like drinking a milkshake and Eggnog milkshake of course

531
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,440
So check out your grocery stores out there, see if you can find some

532
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,440
I got a case in the refrigerator right now that should last me through new years

533
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440

I want to thank you all for coming out and celebrating with me and for all of you listening and home

616
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,240
that have been such a huge part of the success of the Zadecast of the last 100 episodes.

617
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Wow!

618
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
I...

619
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,240
What I really wanted to say to you all tonight was...

620
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Well...

621
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,360
I have a confession to make.

622
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,320
This is not my 100th show.

623
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,720
It's not even my 50th show.

624
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,160
In fact, it's only my 18th show.

625
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:38,640
Yeah, and the first one was a test, so it's really only my 17th official show.

626
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,600
I'll come on guys, I mean, all the great podcasts I was listening to were celebrating

627
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,640
their 100th show and their 50th show and, you know, Adam Curry, he's about to celebrate

628
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,840
his 300th show.

629
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Wow!

630
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Yeah, I know.

631
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,880
And see, I just didn't want to be left that far behind.

632
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Oh!

633
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,080
Well, thank you all for being so understanding, and I know you're all just people on a

634
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,600
special effects loop, but feel free to stick around and enjoy the virtual champagne.

635
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,440
But while you do, raise a glass and celebrate with Adam Curry on the occasion of his 300th

636
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
Daily Source Gold.

637
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Congratulations, Adam.

638
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Merry Christmas.

639
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,120
Have a happy new year, and here's to 2006, the year of the podcast.

640
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
Yo, Bruce.

641
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
Thanks, my brother.

642
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Thank you very much for your contributions.

643
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,840
Thanks for remembering Bruce Cessent and those two bits that you heard on the show.

644
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
That's very nice, dude.

645
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:49,880
Oh, my goodness, my God, father down.

646
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,840
Oh, I went down the wrong tube, man, so sorry about that.

647
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,800
Oh, my goodness, I have to catch my breath for a second.

648
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,120
More on the blank media attack, so we've been talking about, and I just kind of threw

649
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,240
that out there, and you'll see what would come back, and got some interesting comments.

650
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,440
Eric Abelson, just a quick question to pose, where do audiobooks fall on the scheme of things

651
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,000
according to the RIA and ASCAP?

652
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,760
It would seem that audiobook producers would be affected by piracy as defined by the RIA,

653
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
as well.

654
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,760
As far as I can tell, the only difference would be that they aren't broadcast on the radio,

655
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,040
and I have audiobook producers who are profiting from the levee, I don't see how podcasts

656
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
could be excluded as well.

657
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,880
The only difference would be that audiobooks and music publishing materialists for

658
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
sale-to-find prices.

659
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,840
Now, the theory behind the levee is that it's supposed to be used to offset revenue

660
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,560
loss, so it would be tough to justify podcasts, as revenue loss since the podcasts are offered

661
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
freely.

662
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,960
Hmm, that's interesting.

663
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Well, maybe if we find out more about exactly how that levee works and how the money

664
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,560
is distributed, then maybe there's something there.

665
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,800
I mean, it's not that I'm like, the whole, let's go chase after that money, it's just

666
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
interesting.

667
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,560
It's interesting to me how things change, I think, as situations change, rules should

668
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,040
change, or at least should be looked at.

669
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,680
There's nothing wrong with that.

670
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,760
Fred Rico Avers is from the Netherlands.

671
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,200
He says something interesting here in the Netherlands as an organization called Stichting

672
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,600
on the Hondling at Taiskupi for hooting it, better known as the SONT, the Sont.

673
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,440
That's basically the home tape, rock against the home taping motherfuckers.

674
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,440
The lobbying to tax MP3 players up to 25 euros, which is, what is that now these days

675
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
about?

676
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
27 bucks.

677
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,440
Minister of Parliament, we obviously said it would be useless to introduce taxes and MP3

678
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,680
players as they can be easily obtained in a neighboring country where players aren't

679
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
taxed.

680
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:50,560
Another comment that Fred Rico heard, heard from somebody from a consumer protection

681
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,440
organization, it would be unfair because people buying music online, i.e. with iTunes, would

682
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,680
be doubly taxed because Sont downloads already have a tax on them that go to the record

683
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
companies and the artists.

684
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
All right.

685
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Okay.

686
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
Interesting.

687
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Just continue to keep all right.

688
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
It's not a big deal.

689
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,000
You know, it's not bust anyones balls over it.

690
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,160
Here's something that I thought was very cool.

691
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:19,360
The BBC is starting to understand podcasting more and more, and I'm subscribed to a couple

692
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,400
of the BBC podcast, most notably in business, which I don't think I've received a new

693
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
one a long time.

694
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,640
Maybe they're in hiatus or something.

695
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:32,240
The BBC really is a public broadcaster, and although you can't make all people happy

696
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,120
all the time, I would have to say that they're doing a fine job, and BBC radio one, it's

697
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,280
just kind of like the popular, you know, the pop station, top 40 station.

698
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,560
One of the air towns there is Chris Moils, and he puts together a podcast of all the

699
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,280
best bits of his show of the week.

700
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,320
But it's not just like, you know, music stripped out and here's a bunch of bits.

701
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
It's produced.

702
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,560
His crew, I have to admit I haven't listened to a show, but I shall do so now.

703
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,680
I mean, you know, I can't receive it.

704
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,320
I might as well check it out, and I'm definitely subscribed to the podcast just to get

705
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,720
a taste of it.

706
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,120
He really puts it together, you know, and there's a beginning and end, and there's this

707
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,760
banter in between, and it's really something that's being produced in addition to the

708
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
radio show.

709
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,080
And I totally appreciate what's going on, and it was pointed out to me that he gave me

710
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
a little shout out.

711
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
Anybody that you'd like to load to?

712
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Well, we do this podcast.

713
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Do you actually Chris?

714
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Really?

715
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
Hi, Chris.

716
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
Hi.

717
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
It's a bit wasted time.

718
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
I'd like to add him curry.

719
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Oh, and my flatmate Mitch.

720
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Yo, and Chris.

721
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Howdy back at you, my brother.

722
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,880
And know that you are more than welcome in the podcast community.

723
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,280
And we'd love to hear some of the, you know, some of your ideas and some of your stuff,

724
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,880
the absolutely can't do for the BBC.

725
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,960
It may be you, you might even want to consider doing it under an assumed name, but, you

726
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,960
got some funny bits on there, but let's hear it without any restrictions.

727
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,440
It would not be nice.

728
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,440
It looks like the slap cast went dark today.

729
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,560
I'm not quite sure if it was a bandwidth issue or if it was a DNS issue, but I got a whole

730
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,880
bunch of frantic emails from Trucker Tom and from Michael Dell.

731
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,440
He says, Adam, any chance the pod show, pod cast delivery network is going to be open

732
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
real soon.

733
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,240
As you might have heard from others, such as Trucker Lou, Trucker Tom, and a few more slap

734
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,360
cast.com is down.

735
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,360
They were a podcast host.

736
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,040
Looks from the who is data that the guy, Roger Strickland, didn't pay his domain fee

737
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,120
in time and the registrar put their squat page on there.

738
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,240
I guess we're all fucked up and Trucker Tom had noticed the same thing.

739
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:41,680
And indeed, to me, looking at the dates, it may just be a domain, name, renewal thing.

740
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,680
But also Trucker Tom, in his email, shared some of his data transfer with me.

741
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,520
And I happen to know, pretty much what the prices are for that.

742
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,680
And I'm thinking of myself, man, if I think they had like 17, we looked at the podcast

743
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,680
alley, Chris McIntyre, who was now in charge of the meltdown life raft project.

744
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:12,120
Immediately, checked in the database, sawed there about 17 pod cast, who were hosted through

745
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
slapcast.com.

746
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,200
And he's getting emails out to everybody, offering all of those pod casters, immediate

747
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,560
shelter, we're kind of breaking off the team from doing some other things, so they take

748
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,840
a day or two, but we're going to jump in anyone who needs help will definitely help

749
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,880
out no obligations whatsoever just to keep you going, because that really, really sucks.

750
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,680
Oh, man, this is the second time it's happened.

751
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:45,400
What was the other host, the soccer girl in corporate was on, they were like, I don't

752
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,520
know, a whole bunch of the queue potters.

753
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,680
So I have no idea how many people we brought in from over there, but let's hope we don't

754
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,880
see too much of this.

755
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,680
I think that there still is a gross underestimation of the cost of bandwidth, because

756
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,920
the stuff is not free.

757
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:07,620
And actually, Ron and I want to talk a lot more about what we're doing, about issues

758
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,880
in pod casting, about where we're going as a community, where we're going as an industry.

759
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,840
We call it a strategy cast, and we've done, I think, two or three before.

760
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,000
And we were planning on doing one either last night tonight or having something up over

761
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,000
the weekend.

762
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,080
And we had a meeting today and we talked about the format of the show and what we're

763
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,120
going to do, what we're going to discuss.

764
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,000
And also based upon some of the stuff I've seen written on pod cast, I was thinking, maybe

765
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,320
it would be interesting before we do the show for you to set you as podcasters who are

766
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,880
interested to send in your questions as audio comments.

767
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,560
Now send them into us, and then we can answer them to the best of our ability on the

768
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,280
next strategy cast, which we will then put together as soon as we feel that we have,

769
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,800
if the question starts to repeat themselves, then we'll know we'll be ready.

770
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,960
So that should only take a couple days, and I do have a travel day in there, but we're

771
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:08,520
very excited about sharing our strategy and our thoughts with podcasters who are interested.

772
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,280
And you can send off and check this out, a change now, feel free to send it to a

773
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,880
attach your audio comment to your email and send it to strategycast at podshow.com.

774
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,120
So questions that you have comments, anything you think that we contribute to a strategy

775
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,840
cast, but we can address a send it off once again to strategycast at podshow.com.

776
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,720
And I really appreciate it.

777
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,020
Finally today, an email from Greg Tan and Adam Howie-Doin, Andrew Darlow gave me your

778
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
info.

779
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,280
I met him and I met him and saw when we were all on the Joey Reynolds show.

780
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,040
Oh, of course, that's when when a slough got podsafe for peaceplayed.

781
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,440
So slough suggests that I drop you a note, I'm new to the podcasting thing, but I heard

782
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,520
about your show and took a listen, cool stuff, really love to have you hear my music

783
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:01,200
for consideration, and he put in a link to what he says, his brand spanking new podsafe

784
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
pages.

785
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,800
Well, dude, thank you very much.

786
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,080
Welcome to podcasting, welcome to the podsafe music community.

787
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Like your tunes.

788
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,520
Trust me, I wouldn't play it if I, if I didn't mean it.

789
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,080
So this is from the CD Coney Island, Greg Tan, and this is It's You.

790
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:48,080
It's You.

791
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:55,080
Takes my breath away, they're all the things you've helped save, and that's that

792
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:16,360
it's your name to stay, it's you, it's you, darling it's you, dick Jack, now we'll be there,

793
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:25,000
take a tumble through space, and I'll see that I'll always care to have, I'll have

794
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:41,360
filled down and run it around, be led to the things I do, it's you, takes my breath away,

795
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:53,360
all the things you've helped save, and that's that's your name to stay, it's you, it's you,

796
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:09,000
darling it's you, take a plane, I will follow, drag my heart out on the solid, through the

797
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:20,040
clouds, through the rain, through the stars, and back again, every day, every night, for the darkness and the

798
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:36,000
light, and it fades so far, and it will, I'll be there, it's you, it's me, you, takes my breath away,

799
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:49,000
all the things you've helped save, and that's that's your name to stay, it's you, it's you,

800
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:05,000
darling it's you, darling it's you, darling it's you, darling it's you, darling it's you,

801
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:29,640

803
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:55,940
