1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, good morning everybody. Welcome to the daily source code. Right now it is 5 minutes past 8.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,840
It is Wednesday, today is March 2nd, 2005. Got to remind myself, my sister's birthday is coming

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,440
up in three days. I always have that I have like every month. When I say the month, I got

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,760
these little bookmarks in there. So, March is, is Willow's birthday. So, it's five past

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,160
day and as usual, I'm waiting for my daughter. We are supposed to leave at 10 past 8 for

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,840
me to take her to school and she's not done yet with whatever she's doing, probably doing

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,000
her hair. And as we discussed yesterday on the show, I was going to ask her for was okay

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
if we had a podcast together this morning and she agreed. That of course was yesterday,

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,000
last night when she agreed. So, she may have a different view of that right now. And

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm going to do it. Every parent probably doesn't the morning, trying to prod the children

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:15,600
all along. Christina, it's 5 past 8, huh? Sound familiar?

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:26,480
Oh, I see. So, just for the technical part of the show, I'm recording this on the

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,840
I River, the ISP 799, direct to the line in. I'm using my wireless microphone set. And

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,840
what's nice about the I River is when you are recording directly from the line input,

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,560
which of course the receiving part of my wireless mic is hooked up to. You can stick

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,840
the headphones in and you'll actually, it passes the sound through exactly the way it's

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,480
being recorded. So, you've got a real good idea of what's getting captured on, it's not

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,360
you're on the disk in the flash memory in this case. And that I have the one gigabyte version.

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,960
So, we could continue for, oh, 17 hours. And I'm recording at 128 kilobits per second,

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:18,160
KVPS and 44 kilohurred sample rate. So, that's a pretty high quality recording, which

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,120
actually I'll have to down sample a little bit before I put it up because usually I make the

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:32,720
source code 64 KVPS. So, it's not as cold as yesterday, it's probably just going to guess

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:44,080
it's probably about 3 or 4 degrees centigrade. And it's now 7 past 8. Also, I've got her breakfast

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,680
ready. I did another thing that you probably probably recognize if you got kids. I burnt

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,160
the bagel a little bit, so I just kind of scraped off the burnt part. Here she comes, don't tell her.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,480
Hey baby, we're going to do our show today, right? Yeah. The podcast of camera recording now,

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,240
just so you know. Okay, it's a bit of your high-local down. Yeah, it's different. It's perfect.

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,600
Yeah, it's poofy. Come on, get you. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I'm poofy.

29
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
Dude, dude, you have like 3 minutes before we should be going.

30
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:32,560
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. All right. What can I do?

31
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm going to start the movie. Now I'm playing with the Christina. Why not?

32
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,360
What? Just no one who knows she'd only had it. She was listening to it. She was giving it back.

33
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,520
Who? Ellie. You gave your iPod to somebody else?

34
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,920
Sure. She was listening to it and she chapped it. She chapped it. What does that mean?

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,320
She barks. It's it on an eat. Sit on an eat.

36
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,600
It's not. She doesn't really have that. She doesn't really have that. She doesn't really have that.

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,040
Well, let me tell you something. That's a bad idea because she could lose it. She could drop it.

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
She could break it and then watch. She's going to replace it. I doubt it.

39
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
It's not going to lose it. Drop it. I don't think that's a good idea. You shouldn't do that.

40
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
Then why did you do it?

41
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:24,960
You forgot. You forgot. I'm going to get it back. I'm going to get it back. She also has my

42
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,000
name as you want. She gave it back. Okay. Today, right?

43
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,400
Okay. Here's what I'll tell you what's going to happen. You're going to say,

44
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
oh, can I have my iPod back? Oh, I forgot. I left it at home. How much you want a bet?

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How much you want a bet? That's the way it always goes.

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:57,200
Nothing. Just for the honor. Eat. Come on, Hunts. 10 past eight. We should be in the car now.

47
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:06,640
What can I do to make this process go faster? Okay. It's not good for you to eat fast like that.

48
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:24,960
Wow. I hope that this is the same with you and your kids. Or if you don't have them,

49
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
I hope it turns out like this for you when you do have them. Make me feel much better.

50
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,200
No, I was telling the listeners. I said, I hope you recognize this. I hope your kids are like this.

51
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,160
And if not, I hope when you have kids, I hope you they're like this.

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:53,200
So can enjoy this pain. Hey, ginger. Come on, girl. Boy, thing, cat wants to drink from the

53
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,800
boss. Our cat's drink from the faucet. It's up with that.

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,880
I can't wait until he's drinking normally. What? He tried to jump in the shower. The cat. Really?

55
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,320
Why didn't you let it go? Why didn't you let it go? Why didn't you let it go?

56
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,720
Because I need to freak out what's in there. Oh, they're funny.

57
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,520
Okay, good.

58
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,200
Well.

59
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm going to put my coat on, okay? Yeah.

60
00:06:47,520 --> 00:07:04,640
Right. I'm going to have to move the microphone a bit.

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
In fact, I definitely have to move the microphone.

62
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:18,800
See, contemplating putting the mic. Hold on a second. Bear with me. That's rustle.

63
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm sorry about that. It's definitely extremely unpositioned.

64
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,160
Well, I'm not going to find a good place to clip this sucker on. Okay. Now, I'm not quite sure if I

65
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,920
want to, well, I have to see how the acoustics are in the car. I can pick both of us up equally as

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:50,080
well on mic as it is on my right lapel now on which probably will work or it'll probably be just

67
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,680
this crappy listening to me. This isn't a Christina. So I'm sitting on a left-hand side of the car

68
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,040
at least for the next two years. Next four years, three and a half years.

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Yeah, and she'll be sitting on the right-hand. So that's kind of like those.

70
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:20,160
What's that? Right, because we have a European car with the steering wheel on the left-hand side

71
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,440
and it was like, wow, she's awfully young to be driving. We should get you like a little steering wheel.

72
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,120
Well, you please hurry up, my dear. You're so late today.

73
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:44,480
Dang Navit. Child. Dang Navit. Okay, let me get my stuff set up here. Put the recorder on the

74
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,760
lock so I can't accidentally stop the recording. Excuse me. Excuse me.

75
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,040
Uh, putting the, yeah, I put in these, uh, the ones, they're, yeah, they're in there. Not

76
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:08,000
salt and vinegar. You got the good ones. Yeah, well, you have these now. Salt and vinegar is not good

77
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:18,800
for you because it contains salt and vinegar. Of course not. If you don't take time, okay?

78
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,160
Not good. It's the most important meal of the day. Okay. Okay.

79
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
Did, and please take your vitamin C pill?

80
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,200
Oh wow. The hell is that? That's not good.

81
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,120
Why does it make, shouldn't make such a difference when I, uh, check one two.

82
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,520
Oh, that was all about one. Oh, so didn't get louder.

83
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,920
Okay. This is not very interesting. I was planning on being in the car talking with you.

84
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,720
Take your vitamin C pill, please. Okay. Come on, babe.

85
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,720
Okay. Well, so, what is this? Is this what you wipe your face with?

86
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
My face with that wash my hands and I do this. Okay.

87
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,000
Didn't get to play the theme tune. I had everything all cut up. I had the eye trip ready to play your songs.

88
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
I'm sorry. I screwed it up.

89
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,880
Yeah. Somewhat.

90
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,400
I see it's the cable going into the eye river that's a little cruddy shoot.

91
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,200
That stays okay then.

92
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,600
So, yesterday we had, uh, you continue all just tell everyone what's going on. We had a minor crisis

93
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
because Christina's uniform needed to wash it.

94
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,200
Oh, I just wanted to check it out. I left it for five minutes in your room and it still smells like

95
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,840
moldy ass and cigars. What do you mean moldy ass?

96
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,440
Like moldy ass. I washed it in the sink, but it smells. Well, maybe I smoke the cigar, but I don't have

97
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,240
a moldy ass. Let me smell. Let me smell. It's this morning.

98
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,280
I sprayed perfume on it. Well, the moldy ass part might be from someone who was wearing it.

99
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,920
There on the ground, on the ground behind the chair, behind the chair, right where you hung it up.

100
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,440
Give Jim anything. Okay.

101
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I have religious education today.

102
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,200
Ari, yeah, I learned about that at the teacher conference last night.

103
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,160
Oh, yeah, I forgot because I'm the cab driver. You're right.

104
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
On the cook, the cab driver. I saw him like mom.

105
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, well, I got to get you done. Do you want to? Do you phone charged?

106
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
I guess I'll tell you something. Okay, coat, you don't want to wear a coat?

107
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,600
No, I don't wear a coat. Oh, it's fine.

108
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,320
So, let's go. Okay, it is now eight.

109
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,760
Eighteen.

110
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
Let's put the scarf on. Put the scarf on before you go. It's worth the extra 10 seconds.

111
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,800
You're going to tuck your shirt in here. You don't do that either.

112
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,680
Oh, no. No. Christina.

113
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,720
There you go. Ladies and gentlemen, the influences match Weinstein on the youth of America.

114
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,760
It's all mages, false. Ready?

115
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,840
You got your lunch isn't there? Yeah, just open your bag. I think I did.

116
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,160
That's what you should have a song. You know, I can self-reflect blame Canada. You need blame now.

117
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,440
Blame mag.

118
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,120
What close your bag, I kind of still, it's open.

119
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Okay.

120
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
It's like a sound seeing tour now, all of a sudden.

121
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,760
Okay.

122
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,040
Watch out.

123
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,600
So we are here, only everything through the headphones.

124
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Kind of funky.

125
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,040
Let's turn that down for a second.

126
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,280
Yeah, it's cold. What's the temperature? Hold on.

127
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:33,920
Let me just set up the sound system. Make sure that works.

128
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,000
Blame.

129
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,640
Two degrees.

130
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,560
There you go.

131
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
So now we officially begin.

132
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
Let me just stop that. We should have done the tune hours ago.

133
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Okay, backing out of the driveway.

134
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,200
There we go.

135
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,960
So if you didn't read it on the weblog,

136
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,200
even though it's impossible to get Christina out of the door this morning,

137
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,560
I am very proud of her because yesterday last night

138
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,240
I went to the very first parent teacher conference at school

139
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,080
and I actually, I had, what's the, who's the chemistry teacher, Christina?

140
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,280
No, he's a nice guy.

141
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,480
Well, I don't know if he's nice guy.

142
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,080
He's scary. He's thought he was scary.

143
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,040
Well, hold on a second.

144
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,960
But so you set me up for that, right?

145
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,760
No, like, oh man.

146
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,600
So I actually regretted setting it up because I thought he was going to be really mean.

147
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
No, he's like, well,

148
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,440
Christina has the highest marks of the class.

149
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
She's at the best grades.

150
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm like, huh?

151
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm like, huh? I'm so, I see, curry.

152
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
See, you are wide.

153
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Yeah, yeah, and she's really good.

154
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
And you need to get your revision guide or whatever that is.

155
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,880
You have to buy that.

156
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,600
What is that?

157
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,840
Oh, it's just a sort of thing that everyone has to buy.

158
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,160
And let's see if no one bothers us with that one to discuss.

159
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
What is it, but what is it?

160
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,080
I don't, I think it's something to study out.

161
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,040
Just a little bit.

162
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,360
Okay.

163
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,760
So, now we're traveling down good old Epsom Road, which is the later we leave the

164
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
busier at Gets.

165
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,480
And I think we're so late that we've missed a water boy and big bun.

166
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:27,960
Water boy big butt and how about bicycle chick, haven't seen her, dude.

167
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
All our friends.

168
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,800
We should pick up a water boy or just say, hey, you want to ride?

169
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Oh, that's okay.

170
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Okay.

171
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,720
So, but anyway, all of your teachers, at least the ones that I had appointments

172
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
with, were like, Christina's settling in, beautifully.

173
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,200
She seems to be making lots of friends, which I think was really nice, because that was the first thing they all said.

174
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,000
It wasn't like, wasn't about grades, it was about, they were very aware that, you know, you would move in.

175
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, shoot, what's the, oh, that's the, they were very aware that, you know, you came in halfway through the year.

176
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,200
And that's what they were all concerned with, not really made me feel good about, good about the school.

177
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,080
Uh, although, oh, shoot, I'm sorry, lady.

178
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
I didn't even see you do that.

179
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,920
See if I can back up a bit and let her in.

180
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
Come on, baby.

181
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,400
Go, go honey.

182
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
You!

183
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,360
Oh, go ahead, fucking Mark.

184
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,120
Oh man, it's so fucked up.

185
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
Back up a bit.

186
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Yeah, and they're all angry at you because they think you're driving Christina.

187
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
Okay, well, if you're not going to go, but I'm going to go.

188
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,520
People are actually quite nice in, uh, in the UK in, uh, in traffic.

189
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,560
They're really courteous. Is that water? No, that's.

190
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,320
They're really courteous.

191
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,160
They wave you on all the time, and, you know, and especially me, because they, you can't tell by the,

192
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,880
I just, they can't tell by the license plates that were, obviously,

193
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,680
foreigners, um, and so I've done some really stupid shit because, of course, I'm driving

194
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,800
on the left-hand side, and sometimes I get confused.

195
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,880
Not that much anymore, um, and then the, uh, they're no kind of wave like,

196
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
oh, hi, you're bleeding idiot, but that's okay.

197
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,480
Yeah, you had people sitting in the car and laughing at you.

198
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
I had that too, right?

199
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Right, that too, yeah.

200
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Um, audio.

201
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,000
So anyway, Christina, I could not be prouder, really, and you had good grades.

202
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,120
Except, um, who's the inmissive Alan?

203
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, well, what, what, what, what does she teach, uh, biology?

204
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,400
Yeah, you said, well, little bit chatty with Beth.

205
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
Not actually, I had to drag it out of her.

206
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,040
A bit chatty with one of the other students, I said, uh, let me guess, uh, Beth.

207
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,160
He said, yes, who was there? Beth was there.

208
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,960
I can't believe that you didn't come with me.

209
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
Did you talk to Beth?

210
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,480
Uh, she can love to me, she said, hi, Adam.

211
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
Which is nice because, you, at least she didn't say, Mr. Curry,

212
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,160
Oh.

213
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
That makes me feel old.

214
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,600
She's tall too. She's about as she taught of the new, Beth.

215
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Yeah, she's pretty big.

216
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,040
She's so cool. She feels old, because she fancy you.

217
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
That's, that's, that's a very cute.

218
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,720
uh okay see well you don't have any uh any tunes

219
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Christine and that's too bad

220
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,720
so when you get some legal stuff or like we played my music

221
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
I found a really cool podcast

222
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
yeah I want to hear it

223
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Hi there folks and welcome to the inaugural podcast of what is

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
tentatively being called don't be afraid of opera

226
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,720
it's called that because as I hope you'll learn over the next little bit

227
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
you already know a lot of opera

228
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,720
I'm going to attempt to mix a little bit of opera you know

229
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
with some pieces that you don't

230
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,720
um the piece that I just inferred with a little bit there

231
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
that you'll hear more of a little bit later

232
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
is from the barbers of ill by recini

233
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,720
it's a fun little opera and the piece there is called Lago Elfactotum

234
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,720
it's used in all sorts of different things

235
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
from commercials on to movies

236
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,720
or you just may have heard it on the radio

237
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,720
it's a very famous piece because it's a lot of fun

238
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
it's figures and reductions the world

239
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,720

240
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
you know the man about town he's everything

241
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
he's talking hard in the morning

242
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,720
no I think he's uh I think on the compression

243
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
it's mp3 started skipping

244
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720

the barbers of it

247
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,720

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
the eagle is this little station

285
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
high street

286
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
and you can walk in their way

287
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
but people want to record

288
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
the little glass

289
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
tiny glass box

290
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
and you can even get

291
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
requests if you hold up a sign

292
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
in front of the window

293
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
and if you say they're logging up

294
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
and they're really nice actually

295
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
okay

296
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
but the station

297
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
they play the music you like

298
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
um

299
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
they play green day

300
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
okay

301
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,720
oh I was listening to Michael Butler

302
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
rock and roll geek

303
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
and he had his daughter

304
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Martina on his show

305
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
uh

306
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
she definitely doesn't like

307
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
uh

308
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
she doesn't like

309
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
good Charlotte

310
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
and those guys

311
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
yeah

312
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
I think it'd be upset

313
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
here that

314
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
we need to convert her

315
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
I think that's a pretty hard

316
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
chord dude

317
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
when your dad's in a band

318
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Paul American Heartbreak

319
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
and he's touring around Europe

320
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
and you should see Michael Butler

321
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
he is totally

322
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
he looks like a rock and roll

323
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
mutt of fucker

324
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
so when he's famous

325
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
he's famous

326
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
even famous

327
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
even famous

328
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,720
you have a perpetual backstage

329
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720

350
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,720

361
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720

363
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720

364
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
here we go

366
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
it's really commercial

367
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
I like this

368
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
we've seen the amount

369
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,720
to be our life

370
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
to the friends

371
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
of the world

372
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,720
and to the lives of the life

373
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,720
I can be a candy

374
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
or a nasty

375
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
or a record

376
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
or a bonus piece

377
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
there's those

378
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
in the hood

379
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
and dogs

380
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
and cops have an old face

381
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
think I like

382
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
oh

383
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
boom, boom, boom

384
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
you like that kind of stuff

385
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
don't you?

386
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
that's kind of

387
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
that's kind of called

388
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
that hard core

389
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
well

390
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I said he's hard core

391
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
they've got other shit

392
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
to hold on

393
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
second

394
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
try some mouths

395
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
and that's just a really

396
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
one of the

397
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
you know me I'm a commercial guy

398
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
I like that stuff

399
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
sick and tired

400
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
very easy

401
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
feel

402
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
pretty good

403
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm in my chemical romance

404
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
except

405
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
I'm probably back before

406
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
I'm going to remember on that

407
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
show the guy to my swing

408
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
his face

409
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
oh

410
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
it was so funny

411
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
what we watching

412
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
that was a top of the pops

413
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
no top of the pops

414
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
it was top of the pops

415
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
and the base player

416
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
yeah

417
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
it was freaking out

418
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
and he tried to do like

419
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
the base

420
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
the base flew off the

421
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
strap and he looked like

422
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
a big dark

423
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
that was pretty funny

424
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
every bat has a

425
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
now

426
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
so

427
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
green day on the tonight show

428
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
I mean

429
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
try to cool he was

430
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
drumming and he finished

431
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
he threw his drumsticks back

432
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
he tried to step off stage

433
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
I think he might have heard

434
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
himself because he fell

435
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
like

436
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
yeah

437
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
dude I look like

438
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720

439
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
but I need it

440
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
dude

441
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I'm okay

442
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
oh man

443
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
hey you want to go

444
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
riding today

445
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
since yesterday was a bust

446
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
are you going to

447
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
yeah

448
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
you sure

449
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
okay

450
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
well then you have to

451
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
text the

452
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
the stables that

453
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
okay

454
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
so they don't

455
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
feed

456
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
freed

457
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
so

458
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
well two things

459
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
that

460
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
princess back in her

461
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
inner stable

462
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
and they don't feed her

463
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
so we're now

464
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
the

465
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
the busiest part of town

466
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
which is kind of this

467
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
inner section

468
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
junction

469
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
roundabout thing

470
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
which leads up

471
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
to

472
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
the street

473
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
the school is on

474
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
for almost there

475
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
well I hope you'll come back

476
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
on the show again

477
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Christina and bring your iPod

478
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
sorry

479
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
no that's okay

480
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
so

481
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
we really

482
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
we're really late

483
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
well actually

484
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
traffic is not bad

485
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
we're not late

486
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
tutorial is in the

487
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
start

488
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
what doesn't start

489
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
tutorial

490
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
what's tutorial

491
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
I think that

492
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
do the register

493
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
and annoy you as

494
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
notices

495
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
why they call it tutorial

496
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
interesting

497
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
is that a general assembly thing

498
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
y'all have to

499
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
we have an assembly

500
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
we might have one this morning

501
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
I hate this

502
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
but it's so boring

503
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
what do you do with a

504
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
assembly

505
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
sin

506
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
sin

507
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
kumbaya

508
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
oh he listened to the boys

509
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
while last time

510
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
but that's cool

511
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Christina goes to

512
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
like a

513
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
music specialist school

514
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
which means there's a lot of

515
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
bands who play green day all day long

516
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
but no they don't

517
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
let them play back

518
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
or so they've seen the line

519
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
came

520
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
no

521
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
the line

522
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
they didn't have a little

523
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
dance

524
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
to the left

525
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
no way

526
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
that's so lame

527
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
everyone must really

528
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
happy doing that

529
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720

there she goes

569
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
and

570
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
it's got

571
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
my legs

572
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
and her mom's looks

573
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
that's the combination you want

574
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
believe me

575
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
of course now you know when I

576
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
when I honk in the

577
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
other kids around you won't even

578
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
acknowledge that I'm

579
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
even closely related to her

580
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,720
oh guys go ahead you cross the road

581
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
okay

582
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
well

583
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
so that was

584
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
uh...

585
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
turn out

586
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
go ahead

587
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
turn out a little

588
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
different than I expected

589
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
but that's okay

590
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
because

591
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
yeah

592
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
it's

593
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
it's the surprise

594
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
now

595
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
here comes the worst part of the

596
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
of the commute today

597
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
or the commute

598
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
the drive

599
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
is

600
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
turning around

601
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
so

602
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
I want to

603
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
be going the other way on this road

604
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
so I have to pull in

605
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
it's

606
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
somehow

607
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
funky man when you're writing

608
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
a dirty on the left hand side

609
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
through like

610
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
you turn

611
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
just feels really weird

612
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
and

613
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
so it's particularly busy today

614
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
we just get a

615
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
time check

616
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
it's like

617
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
uh...

618
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
it's 30 minutes

619
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
okay good

620
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
good

621
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
we're still going to

622
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
come in at 40

623
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
let me uh

624
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
position the mic

625
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
so I have a little more

626
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
this truck driver let me

627
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
not be very cool if he did

628
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:34,720
sorry about that

629
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
okay

630
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
uh

631
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
looks like he's going to let me in

632
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
you know

633
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
dude

634
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
totally appreciate it bro

635
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
okay

636
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,720
okay

637
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
oh yeah I wanted to say

638
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
something

639
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
I've been following

640
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Dave Weiner

641
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
and his

642
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
his discussions about

643
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
the Google toolbar

644
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
and I just want to say

645
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
even though I've never used the toolbar

646
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
nor can I use the toolbar

647
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
because I'm a Macintosh user

648
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
I can totally see how

649
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Christina would install something like that

650
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
in fact

651
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
the computer that I bought

652
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
or the windows computer

653
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
came pre-installed

654
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
with some form of toolbar

655
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
which may have been a Yahoo

656
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
toolbar

657
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
maybe even

658
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
what is that thing

659
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
the packet bell or an HP

660
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
I don't know what brand

661
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
it is

662
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
there is some form of toolbar

663
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
already installed

664
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
and I can totally see

665
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
where she would install something like that

666
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
for some benefit

667
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
and

668
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
and not know

669
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
what else would be in the toolbar

670
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
so the idea of

671
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
of opting in

672
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
is

673
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
the toolbar

674
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
will be pretty prevalent

675
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
there's going to be two bars for all kinds of things

676
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
and we two bars

677
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
with the already art tool bars

678
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
but two bars

679
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,720
you know functionality within two bars for tracking

680
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
for

681
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
tracking is a big one actually

682
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
tracking

683
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,720
what some might call your attention

684
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,720
and

685
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
so

686
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
up in the air is whether you care about it or not

687
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
as a consumer

688
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
or as a

689
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
producer of content

690
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
personally

691
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
I don't want people

692
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
or companies

693
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
necessarily

694
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
downstream

695
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
changing

696
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
something that I've done

697
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
and granted right now

698
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
it's

699
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
pretty benign

700
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
and

701
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
it's showing

702
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
ISBN numbers for books

703
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
but

704
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Dave's point

705
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
that companies

706
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
you know

707
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
where do they draw the line

708
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
we may have our disagreements

709
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Dave and I

710
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
but

711
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I'm a commercial mother

712
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
fucker

713
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
and let me tell you

714
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
if I were Google

715
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
I'd certainly be doing that

716
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
or I'd be contemplating it

717
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
and I've been thinking about it

718
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
and I certainly would find ways to make money

719
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
off of this wonderful toolbar

720
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
and I am

721
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
therefore very sure

722
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
that Google is going to do the same

723
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
so

724
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
I'm with you

725
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
on that one

726
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
okay

727
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
you know what we'll do

728
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
I actually

729
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
prepared for this

730
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
there's

731
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
two things I

732
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
had loaded up

733
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
hold on

734
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
I got to go back to my playlists

735
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
just so convenient

736
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
I'll set up

737
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,720
playlists here

738
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
for today's show

739
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
I mentioned it right today

740
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
it's March 2

741
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
okay

742
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
first of all

743
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
let me play this

744
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
now we'll go out with that

745
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
what I'll do now

746
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
is

747
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
something that you could have expected

748
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
one

749
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
casting

750
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
with

751
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
three

752
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
two

753
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
one

754
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,720
it's time for the head

755
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
with your

756
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
right

757
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
there you test

758
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
this one is a bit different

759
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
answer number three

760
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
it's going to be played

761
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
all the way

762
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
so the whole song

763
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
the whole track

764
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
if you want to stop it

765
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
you may

766
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
but

767
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
I think you're like it

768
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
and you will

769
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
let it play

770
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
okay here we go

771
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
this is number one

772
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,720
one

773
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,720
one

774
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
okay

775
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
I'm over one

776
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I've no idea what that was

777
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
also sounds a little weird

778
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
through the speakers

779
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
and this is number two

780
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
okay

781
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I know that one

782
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
that is

783
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Spendal Ballet

784
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
and true

785
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
which is a great song

786
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
classic Evergreen

787
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
and the final one

788
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
this is number three

789
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
oh

790
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720

791
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720

798
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720

802
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
this is number one

803
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
I didn't get the first one

804
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
the leap up the goal

805
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
refers

806
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,720
I would never

807
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
yes

808
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I would never

809
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
just play

810
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720

815
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720

816
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720

922
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:54,640

923
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,960
but had fun, hope the audio quality wasn't too crappy on the Dan Hartman and hope you enjoyed

us hanging out. Hey man, who needs a mixer when you've got a stereo system in the car?
