1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's Adam Curry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey, good morning, it's Monday.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And, well, come on.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Everybody, today's source code, the last one coming to you from South Beach in Florida.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Once again, you're in my bed.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And it's also not really Monday, but well it is Monday morning.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a quarter to one, AM.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, this one's done before I go ahead.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,440
Here's basically the choice I saw that I had I could get up really early tomorrow morning

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:43,000
Probably around 6.37 o'clock and do the source code and be on track with you as a Monday morning show

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,400
Or I could just do this now and sleep in a little bit, you know, maybe chill until 8.8.30

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,160
I don't have the luxury that I usually have when I'm in the in the cottage in the UK

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,600
Where I'm five hours ahead of basically east coast time

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Or should I say east coast time

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,760
And of course now for once folks over in Europe will have a source code nice and early because what time is it now?

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,720
It's but it was so it's a quarter to six

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
UK time

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,080
I was taking my shower. It was a long long day today and I was really contemplating

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,560
I really want to do a source code. There's a couple of things. Boops.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,960
Two couple of things I wanted to talk to you about. You know what? I figured

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,000
What better way than to spend the last evening that I have with all of my daily source code friends

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,560
My last evening not the last evening I have ever with the last evening here in in Florida

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,160
Which has been beautiful, man. I cannot believe the weather that we've been having

24
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,520
Or I guess it's normal for for Florida, but

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Honky boy like me from Gilford to totally beautiful

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,560
So I also wanted to share the last bit of weed that I had here

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,000
We're not really gonna share it, but I'm gonna roll one up and smoke it

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,680
Like you don't know I do that right? Anyway, so let me tell you about about my day

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,120
And then I want to talk about a couple things and they will shut a turn and I'm gonna go to bed

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,760
Because you know travel day tomorrow and I probably won't

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,960
Have another well I arrive to see tomorrow so I'd leave Monday evening arrive Tuesday morning

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,240
And Gilford up of course. I'll be totally wrecked because

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm not counting on any upgrade like I had on the way over boy. That was beautiful

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,640
Now you'll recall that I contemplated upgrading myself one class of service from

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,720
Economy basically to to club which is a business class on British Airways

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
But then saw the price tag

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,480
One way up great is like

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:09,320
1800 pounds $3,000 and at that point I said screw that actually I heard was the podcast brothers talking about that

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,160
That I'm now I have officially proven my geek status that I decided to fly coach so I could buy a new Mac

40
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,080
I felt that money would be better spent. That's totally agree

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,920
So what I thought maybe I do tomorrow is I go to

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,720
It's an apple store not too far away from here

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,480
And you know the Steve could jobs is doing the apple keynote speech tomorrow from San Francisco

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,760
So let's say that's probably around noon east coast time and

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,600
From what I understand I haven't really seen a verification on the web that one of the things that I always look forward to was

46
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,800
A Steve Joe Steve jobs keynote that I could watch on the web and

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,560
They started doing this what I guess

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,000
Must have been around 99 maybe or

49
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,120
2000 when when you know they really started doing this regularly on

50
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,120
Whenever there was a keynote and shit man

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,280
Sometimes we'd have parties you know we'd have friends come over and we put up on the big grandmas of you screen and

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,240
You know popcorn beer hanging out looking at the new gadgets

53
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:27,640
Apparently that's not gonna happen this time around and you can only watch it if you're there live or if you're in an apple store

54
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Which I'm sure is a

55
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,480
Very understandable marketing employee to get you to buy something on spot

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Maybe I'm wrong

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
But I think it's a shame I

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,800
Really love watching and maybe there'll be a repeat maybe it's just not the maybe you can't watch it live or

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,480
God who knows

60
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
It's a shame it's a shame so anyway

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm thinking of maybe going to an apple store to check that out and then maybe actually buy a computer

62
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,040
I also have to figure out something for Christina because she

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,480
blew up the laptop that I gave or we'll didn't really blow it up I guess it was not totally hurt fall

64
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,720
There was a little fragile there was a 802 11 be obey for basically a Wi-Fi card

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
that

66
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,040
Was put into the PCM CIA slot and

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,920
And yeah, that kind of yeah, I'm not quite sure what happened, but she had to pull it out and put it in and that was

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,960
Partially because she didn't pull it out then it would still can you know continuously talk to

69
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
the airport base station

70
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Which means the motor would stay dialed in which means my mother-in-law couldn't call okay?

71
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,720
So she had to pull it out whenever she was done with a computer and

72
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,680
And she shorted out the PCM CIA slot and it you know, well that

73
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,400
That means you got to send it somewhere and that's uh, I don't know if it's going to be worth it for that machine

74
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,280
But of course she wants to have a windows machine and she she's really cute about it

75
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,800
She's you know dad I'm really sorry, but you know I do like the coolest MSN I want the new MSN features

76
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
I just can't get it on the Mac

77
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,360
Something to be said for that, I mean that's that's the power of some positioning in a brand and

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:13,640
Putting something on the desktop that hey, I'm basically going to buy windows and a windows machine because of the cool features of MSN that you got on windows and and not on a Mac so

79
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
And you can get a

80
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,960
A laptop these days for five six hundred dollars and the way the pound is I mean the pound is

81
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,480
What is it like a buck 90 or something so that's it's like candy land over here shopping with the euros and pounds

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Hey, you know what before we go any further

83
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
I've got to play you this cadence

84
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,880
I'm not prepared by the way. I don't have my outline or up

85
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,240
I don't have the show notes rolling none of that so it's a little bit off the cuff

86
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Let me see if I can find the email

87
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:54,600
It was I do want to give the right credit home on my fire fox has been acting a little with my whole Mac has been acting a little weird actually

88
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,280
I have a feeling that

89
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,480
You know how sometimes you're fine. They're just goes a bit crazy and stuff seems to slow down and

90
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,400
I think it's time for new install of the

91
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
system software

92
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Hold on let me see if I can

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Find this because I want to give proper credit bear with me for a second

94
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
This drum cadence

95
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Was sent to me by

96
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,200
Come on, I'm basically doing my email now on crap

97
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,520
For some reason my Mac mail program won't work with this network and it has nothing to do with

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,920
The ports it has to do with my Mac. I'm sure there's something wrong there

99
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
Hold on a second

100
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
We're gonna search this now

101
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
So I'm using the the web browser

102
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Mac email

103
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,760
Which is not at all handy when you're used to just zapping through some of it. Okay, this is something to me by Elvin

104
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Was Elvin's last name

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,560
Okay, Elvin says per world of the podcast mainstream drum bands songs. Okay. You got this from the

106
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,840
What is this a band that you split Disneyland

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,040
Herdum play it every day when I worked inside the park. Oh cool. I wonder what the Elvin was if he was

108
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,080
To say what he was in the park were you in a suit or you were you in the band

109
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,760
Anyway, I just couldn't resist. I said myself this is exactly the type of two

110
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
I want to hear from a

111
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
It's the Jackson's theme everybody

112
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Feel free to sing along

113
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Go Jackson

114
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
You

115
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
You

116
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, awesome, Elvin. Thank you very much

117
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,240
Totally put me in the right mood for for the podcast theme from the jetsons

118
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,480
Drum cadence. Well more than just the drum cadence. I guess here on the daily source code

119
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Which of course is for Monday?

120
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
January 10th

121
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,000
2005 moving right along in the brand new year

122
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,520
Let's see today started off very early with breakfast meeting

123
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,720
You know we've been doing meetings all this past week and in the weeks to come

124
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm gonna start talking about you know some of the things we've learned. I've learned certainly

125
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
I'll tell you one thing. We're only scratching

126
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,040
You know just the tip of this stuff just the very tip of the iceberg of what's gonna be possible

127
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,200
We're going and you know with with just amazing amounts of talent that's out there

128
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,720
That is finally getting a voice. It's uh that's gonna be great

129
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Okay, so at 11 o'clock

130
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
as was agreed to

131
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,960
CBS evening news

132
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,680
showed up here at the hotel and to interview me about well you guessed it about podcasting

133
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,480
I've been working with the producer on this lovely lady from New York

134
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,520
Her name is Linda

135
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,720
I've been working on well basically coordinating it for the past couple of weeks and you know this whole all of this work by the way is for

136
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,680
for two minutes which is a lot but for two minutes in the CBS evening news with Dan Rather

137
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,600
and it was Linda and the reporter

138
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:35,080
Totally spacing of course on the reporter a Sharon Sharon Alfonci. That's Sharon with a Y by the way S. H. A. R. Y. N

139
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Who is a completely the up-and-coming

140
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Personality on

141
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
the evening news

142
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,160
as

143
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,560
Some of the CBS staffers like to say

144
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,760
She's the up-and-coming girl that the grown-ups really like the grown-ups being the management

145
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Hold on a second

146
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,360
Is this uh I feel a little bit is it is it soft a little bit tonight the I mean the recording?

147
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Yes, not it seems pretty much the same

148
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,440
Well, what I like well, that's okay, and so so they're gonna interview me about podcasting

149
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,040
What was great is that everyone had done their homework that listened to podcasts

150
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,480
Definitely knew it had looked up and read up on you know the basics

151
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,440
And of course, you know the bear in mind that if you're creating two minutes, you know

152
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,760
There's there's just not a hell of a lot you're gonna get in there and of course it's all sound bites and

153
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,760
I've learned how to talk and sound bites and this obviously goes against everything that podcasting is because

154
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
well basically

155
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,600
In commercial television well in all television you have a time restriction you only have 24 hours in a day

156
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,360
And we've talked about this every minute is worth something every second every nanosecond is worth something so it's all you know it gets compressed and it gets

157
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:59,720
It gets harder and harder and harder to communicate something and so the only thing I can do if I want to communicate something is kind of work along

158
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,280
With the whole system and talk and sound bites which I did I'm good at that

159
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,520
I don't want to practice oh, but I remember one point MTV they had

160
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,560
They would bring in these new executives every oh, I don't seem like every three months for a while there

161
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm the very early 90s and at one point there was this big idea it was light switch and we're gonna switch everything

162
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,240
It's all gonna be different on Monday and I basically meant that we were sitting in

163
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,360
In front of blue screen and blue screen is what the weather the weather people use

164
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,400
The weathermen are weather with a girl with a woman so they can project a map behind you

165
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,920
Except MTV wasn't projecting blue screen some of the older source code listeners will remember that they you know

166
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,120
We weren't projecting weather maps obviously on the blue screen, but they had like a diner set

167
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,920
or some you know

168
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,120
Situation outside and then basically you'd be in the corner of the screen somewhere on a little television

169
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,040
Playing in a you know like at a new stand doing your segment which wasn't very nice because

170
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,280
Well, you know it's a small television a small screen you start off with but then to be a small screen on a small screen was like

171
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Thank you, but that wasn't even the worst part the worst part was that they brought in some radio consultants and

172
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,880
And they said well, you know, we've got to make sure that this is this is run like radio

173
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,360
We have some proven concepts and one of them is you shouldn't be talking longer than seven seconds per break

174
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,600
And they had like a 12 second break in a seven second break so literally you would have to talk about the next video

175
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,320
Or or tease what was coming up and then be someone next the camera counting down 12 seconds

176
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
You know it's almost impossible

177
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,200
But that is kind of what a lot of commercial television is

178
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,800
Not just commercial television any television any

179
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
traditional

180
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Linear broadcast

181
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,760
So that the radio or television has to deal with the time issue

182
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,000
So it was great that everyone was everyone was

183
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
prepared and

184
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Um

185
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Sharon actually wanted to do

186
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Well, she didn't really want to do a podcast, but she was she didn't want to see the whole process

187
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,120
So we did that a record that I totally got to plug the listivious bitties and I'm I think you know

188
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,640
If I if I did all the soundbites right and talked right and and of course

189
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,520
I was really working with these people with with Linden and Sharon

190
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,360
I think we're gonna get the a little piece of the bitties played on CBS even news

191
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,160
I got to say that's very cool that's gonna that's gonna that's gonna take on me if we pull that one off

192
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,960
And I think that by you know, it was in the in the whole song. I want to be famous

193
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,080
It it totally makes sense for the piece that that they're gonna make

194
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,360
They'd also heard my uh sound seeing tour

195
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,840
So they wanted me you know that well they want to get video of that which of course is

196
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,760
Impossible because it already happened so I kind of did the same thing you know walked on the street

197
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,920
I did walk down with more less you know the same

198
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,080
The same outfit the same gear you know so you can kind of see how I did that and I did say more or less the same

199
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Things and

200
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,920
If anything it'll probably be in there for like three seconds and they'll be a voice over saying curry sometimes

201
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Walks down the street while looking like any

202
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,280
Talk or do himself and people love it

203
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
um

204
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,440
So you know that's that's just to make it all kind of fit together

205
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,000
And so this took a long time they showed up at eleven which was the time that we agreed upon and you know

206
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,400
You're resetting stuff you're sitting down from the computer then when you're the over-the-shoulders to get the the close-ups of the computer

207
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,720
um

208
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
You know then

209
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,680
And it's nice because it wasn't really an interview. It was really just a conversation that we had which I totally love it when we when when you do that and not you know

210
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,920
Not have to

211
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,200
You know look at someone and answer their questions as they read off of piece of paper or whatever on you know

212
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,800
off to one side of the camera so it was like a real conversation and

213
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
and

214
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,280
Sharon is a really nice. She's uh was she's 32 years old

215
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,120
Think um just totally nice and very very smart and I might mention very cute

216
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Or certainly

217
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
Yeah, and there she was cute very cute

218
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,640
Can you tell that it's working this last one that I promised myself? I'm starting to slow down a little bit here

219
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:23,400
So that lasted until about oh say it's what time we've probably done around one 30 because you know we walked over to ocean drive

220
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,440
From the hotel to actually do that bit in the camera of course had to get set up blah blah blah

221
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,160
And then she had to do a couple of stand-ups which I was actually quite funny because they had a crew a local crew

222
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,040
They got you from the CBS affiliate or production facility whatever and so Linda the producer of course is making sure that the shot is you know

223
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,440
What she wants and that the what Sharon is saying is what what they need and she was basically doing a stand-up saying

224
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,600
Well, you know you can be

225
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,840
If you like broadcasts and you can be a podcaster and you can do it anywhere even walking down the street if you don't mind going through with

226
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,680
Fewer through steps

227
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,040
Through a few steps

228
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,640
I think that means you know or you have to learn how to do it or whatever

229
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:10,600
Hopefully it's not gonna come off as it's difficult because I tried to make it certainly look as easy as possible as to how to create a podcast and

230
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,480
Certainly how to receive one because that you know, don't have to be more than the click of a mouse on a web page or

231
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,920
If you have an iPod or subscribing to a feed so that it puts it on your MP3 player

232
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:29,240
But they didn't have someone to hold the elephant diaphragm as I call it which I guess Sharon had never heard because she left a budget or it wasn't really a joke

233
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,760
It's the basically it's that big round reflecting thing that you see

234
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,200
film sets photo shoots television

235
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:43,400
Stand-ups whatever and it's golden one side white on the other side typically and you can basically use it to bounce

236
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,960
The sun reflect off off of this this sheet and it does kind of look like a big-ass diaphragm and it's you know

237
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
It's kind of it's made of cloth and it has a

238
00:18:53,080 --> 00:19:00,840
The edges flexible so you can kind of collapse it down and fold it up over two times and it fits into a nice little bag and then you take it out of that bag and

239
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,560
It expands to this big elephant diaphragm look and thing. It's a reflector

240
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,360
So I was reflecting the light onto Sharon's face to make her and you know look pretty because they did basically were a hand short

241
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,600
And that was it was kind of fun. I hadn't done the diaphragm in a long time

242
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Boeing and

243
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,040
After that while the crew was packing up that we sat down had a had a coke

244
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,080
I'm sorry the girls had died cooks and

245
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,280
And then Linda who's been it at CBS as she says for I guess Zillian years

246
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,680
Yeah, I know that sounded like magic. I'll get to that in a second and

247
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,280
You know, of course there's some well actually how do we come about this?

248
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,520
I think during the interview at one point or to the conversation it was we were talking about

249
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,600
podcasting how it relates to web logs and and said well, you know web logs

250
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,840
You know they're starting to mean something you can just ask Dan Ra

251
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,840
I

252
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,640
Look at the camera said you know that shit. I'm getting nothing

253
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,680
And then like everyone's cracking up like no, I said that's so horrible. That's a restrictive the

254
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,920
There's so much you can't do because of corporate politics and of course I totally agreed and I know it's like because I've been in

255
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,520
A corporate political corporate political television broadcast situation. It's just the way it is

256
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,240
And then it can't fault it. That's just what it what is this way? It's grown and we don't have that those restrictions thank God

257
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,600
Because no one owns us if you don't want to be owned as a podcast, you don't have to be owned which makes it beautiful

258
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,280
If you want to be on radio or TV your ass is gonna be owned by somebody

259
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,880
So of course the conversation turned around or turned quickly to the memo who's it fault? What's happening?

260
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,720
You know, I said hey, you know this investigation is supposed to last only a few weeks. You know, hey

261
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,240
It's starting to look like a couple of months. You know, it's just taking a long time

262
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,240
And all of this was off the record and

263
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,240
Linear did tell me a few things and I promise not to talk about it

264
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,360
I won't talk about it, but she did give me a little tidbit that she said I could talk about on my podcast

265
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,040
And I think this is pretty much it's general knowledge within CBS

266
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,880
At least it seems so so it's not like this is coming from only one source, but I certainly had never heard it before

267
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,880
That the

268
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,080
evening or the

269
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,560
Was it the day after the the story broke about the Clinton memos when Dan went on the air

270
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
He was wearing his

271
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Very special shirt

272
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,320
And he has a shirt that has monogram cuffs that

273
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,480
Have the initials

274
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
F-E-A

275
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,160
Embrouidered on the cuffs and that stands for

276
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Fuck-a-Mall

277
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,920
So I thought that was a little interesting tidbit that you wouldn't get here on the source code

278
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,960
I'm probably nowhere else, but tells you a little bit about Dan rather as well and the CBS

279
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,120
Organization

280
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,560
Of course also couldn't really talk about Howard Stern, which is a bit unfortunate

281
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,960
because

282
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Howard Stern and CBS are

283
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,640
The same company and of course an embarrassment for the parent company of CBS

284
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,400
That Howard Stern is leading so therefore you can't talk about it, which and that's fucked up because I think Howard Stern

285
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Leaving for satellite radio

286
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,520
Is relevant to the story and to podcasting in some ways

287
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,560
It's not just a financial story. There's more to it

288
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,920
But they know that also is a show is literally a show stopper

289
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,720
So kind of interesting to know that you know that that's the stuff that you will never

290
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Here or see on CBS

291
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,120
Because it's embarrassing to the to the corporate parent

292
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,640
Second don't have me on my lighter broke

293
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,520
I have these what is this cafe med the heart of South Beach

294
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,680
These matches crack they're wet

295
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Which one more time

296
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Come on baby light

297
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,720
Got it oh

298
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
No go out. Oh

299
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,400
There goes on too high. Okay

300
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
There we go

301
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Good

302
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Okay

303
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
And

304
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,160
Got back. Oh, man. I was so tired after that

305
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Cultivation Christina

306
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,080
Yeah, because they were you know close to getting ready to go to bed actually by that time

307
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,400
Had a quick nap how to shower and then went out for for dinner. I like a none

308
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,800
A non-business talked dinner with my friend Ron Bloom his lovely wife Marta

309
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:46,520
And it was just nice. We went to actually cruise on a couple of the re i mean Marta knows that she's she's a model or was a model here in Miami

310
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,080
Know's everybody

311
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,480
All the beautiful people and so we went to some of these you know like the Ian Schrager restaurant and

312
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,840
God, I don't remember in the name of all these places, but it was just all you know beautiful people and white flowing curtains and

313
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
a cool breeze and

314
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,160
Food and the right music and you know totally

315
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:15,400
Well, like I walked into an episode of fucking Miami vise, you know except without the drug dealers or at least you know without the blatant drug dealer

316
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm sure lots of people are drug dealers who go to those places and you know hey they got to eat too

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,520
And they had her entitled to a nice evening out, but it was really absolutely just at the night the weather was nice

318
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,840
The food was excellent. I think this is Robert De Niro's place that we ate at which is ago agio ago ago

319
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
I think that's a pronounce it ago. I'd say

320
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
And just nice Italian food

321
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,360
I had those see what I have I had

322
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:51,000
Carpacho and then I had a grouper with black olives and hmm just outstanding outstanding

323
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Got back

324
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,560
And of course, you know, I decided that I'd do a podcast now

325
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,640
I did something that I do ever that I've been doing all week long all week long

326
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,480
between like 11 and one I would go to

327
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,080
My

328
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,040
iPodder

329
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Which of course really runs only once an hour and I do a manual scan

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,800
Because I want to see if there was another yeast radio if match wine scene it updated now

331
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,200
You probably heard about you know, oh the big controversy boy

332
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,720
Well, how to fund a

333
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,640
Leave comments everywhere on the on the web logs about magic gate

334
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,000
It's a little bit of confusion that crept into all of this

335
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,200
First of all, I just got to say right off the bat

336
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,640
That if anyone thinks that and I can only talk for myself here, so that's all I'm gonna do if anyone thinks that I did know that

337
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
A match wine scene wasn't a woman

338
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,880
Well, you know, did you really have been listening to anything? Of course, I didn't know that

339
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,320
You know, I I figured it was exactly what it sounded like like a 50 year old

340
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:06,120
Either trans sexual trans vestide trans gendered something person

341
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Probably Jewish

342
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,240
Who had a very outspoken mind and didn't mind, you know

343
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,200
Saying it with a whole bunch of nasty words or nasty words, you know

344
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,400
It cracks me up. Here someone say Americans

345
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
And

346
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,120
I'd become in a very short amount of time even though I only I guess

347
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:36,040
Yist radio has been around for at least a year maybe maybe even longer

348
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,440
Oh, I second can I check that didn't I think match

349
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Posted

350
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
an older

351
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
show I

352
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,200
God fire foxes like why is fire fox?

353
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Hosing out like this

354
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
I don't like it. Okay, hold on

355
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Let me just check real quick. Where's

356
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,200
He was he's radio. I think my mac is really sick

357
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Maybe tomorrow when I go to the apple store

358
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,840
Oh, I see if anyone any of the anyone the genius bar has a clue

359
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So what is this September now?

360
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:29,080
12 23 so I was before Christmas. I don't think I would was I listening then. No, okay, it doesn't matter

361
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
Here's what happened

362
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
So

363
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,440
I totally

364
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,200
Honest the god had that and we've talked about theater of the mind right I really had that image

365
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
of match-wine steam in my head

366
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,000
You hear the voice you hear a very mature person

367
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,120
Speaking about you know political

368
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:00,120
Issues it was yeah, blew me away. It was like to me this was this was what Howard Stern would want to

369
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,440
Would want to do

370
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,000
Particularly if he could speak his mind freely and

371
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,160
You know this got into such a frenzy. I just love this this podcast so much

372
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,800
That I you know I did something I've never done before on the source goes

373
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:22,120
It let me let me call this person up and just say hey I'm a big fan and and keep it up and

374
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
This phone call

375
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,880
The person I was

376
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,400
Talking to

377
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,040
Sounded to me very much like a real person

378
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,520
Not with you know all the pissed off magic is a little bit of that which of course made me laugh

379
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,440
But because it there was nothing really funny intended and and it was a phone conversation

380
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,800
It was not an interview although Madge may have thought it was an interview

381
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,000
You heard basically the whole thing right I called up and say hey you know we're recording it

382
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,640
We're recording now so you know that to me sounded like mad you asked that question in fact in in this conversation

383
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
It's how old you I'm 50 you know

384
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,400
So two things happen simultaneously

385
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,640
Two days later I guess when

386
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:21,480
There was not a regular yeast radio podcast but a podcast which was kind of like a scripted comedy bit and it completely broke down

387
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Everything that I had in my head it's shattered this image

388
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,200
It's I think I mentioned this before it's kind of my dad one said that you know when he was young

389
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,200
There was no television they listened to the radio and they had these plays on the radio

390
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,680
And these drama series and it was you know the green hornet and whatever and his dad my grandfather

391
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,760
Took him to a radio studio one day to see this and I guess my dad must have had a similar

392
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,240
Type of reaction where it totally blew the entire experience form

393
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,720
You know it's like never again could he listen to the green horn or the lone ranger god knows what it was

394
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,760
Without knowing that these like you know just you know

395
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,080
Guys who didn't look anything like superheroes or or you know people who could save your life

396
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,480
We you know with sound effects and reading scripts and and it ruins it

397
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,280
Or you know you know how that works that blew his his whole theater of the mind image that he had created and I had

398
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Totally created this this image of Madge Weinstein

399
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,160
Because when I heard Madge Weinstein talk about

400
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
politics and about

401
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,440
World issues

402
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,000
I said to myself yeah, it's obvious that's not scripted that's a real person saying real things

403
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:50,440
I don't care if your name is Richard bluestein or greenstein or yellowstein or Madge Weinstein that was a real person

404
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
And it

405
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
You know it hit home with me every single time

406
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
So what happened is first of all

407
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,640
There's this whole scripted thing which you know made me immediately think oh my god you know

408
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,760
How much of the person I spoke to

409
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,360
on the telephone was Madge Weinstein

410
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,480
Was it you know this person or not forget what the person is called and forget

411
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,840
Yeah, just forget what the person's called that that's irrelevant

412
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,480
At the same time and I hadn't gone searching you know Google

413
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,640
I don't typically go searching Google for people. I had a great image of what Madge Dean

414
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,880
Madge Weinstein looked like in my head and there was like

415
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,560
You know all I had was an an RSS 2.0 podcast feed. That's all I needed from Madge

416
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,360
And then I get all these pointers and that was pretty obvious pretty quickly that

417
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,200
Madge Weinstein certainly does not look like the 50 year old

418
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,360
Transgender trans sexual transvestite

419
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:57,240
Whatever person 50 years old ballding Jewish you know that I thought but a much younger guy

420
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,400
I'd say late 30s probably

421
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,920
Um, and so that that whole image was just like you know scrap and then you know on top of that this

422
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:19,160
This which you're boosting I believe is a performer and the Madge Weinstein character is a character

423
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,160
and

424
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,880
Here's what I heard I heard a

425
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Bit a skit and

426
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,400
The first few minutes were were actually pretty funny

427
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,760
But then it was kind of like I said one of those saturday night live bits where it just goes nowhere and you just kind of like hope like

428
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,200
You know, you know, maybe something brilliant will happen at the end or you know what I mean right? Sometimes it just doesn't work

429
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,400
Sometimes it does like you know when you have more cowbell

430
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
But it wasn't working and

431
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,680
And so a whole bunch of things started happening at the same time. I was like oh my god

432
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:53,800
You know

433
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,840
Here I was I thought very vulnerable because I was totally open and honest

434
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
with Madge Weinstein

435
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Who I thought I had on the phone

436
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:12,680
Saying you know, I really dig your stuff, you know, and I didn't mean your act or your bit. I mean what you were saying about political issues

437
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,880
So it was very confusing very confusing, you know, so who would I talk to how much was an act and?

438
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
I probably

439
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,920
Both probably should have waited before responding to that

440
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,400
Probably

441
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,800
But doesn't matter because you know, hey, you know, Madge Weinstein says fuck you to people

442
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,600
I get to say fuck you to people and it can also be to her it doesn't matter because you know

443
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That's just digs and stones

444
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,240
But I certainly meant it you fuck you, you know, the fuck is all that about

445
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,320
I was it's like little syvees bitty, you know if that would turn out to be

446
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:58,920
Someone completely different than than than who I know and been talking about and you know turns out to be

447
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,080
Like the bangles who tried to secretly reinvent themselves, you know, I I'd feel shitty too

448
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,640
And it's not a bad that's not a good comparison forget about that anyway, so

449
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,360
The next day or maybe was that evening

450
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
Madge

451
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,280
Replayed a podcast from December that was a December 23rd

452
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,040
I didn't listen to it. I didn't want to hear anything old. I know you know

453
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,600
I got it if if if you if you disclose to you are then I missed it

454
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
And I apologize then if that was

455
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:42,120
On it was just unclear to me and I was as we say in the lowlands. I was on it put on the wrong foot

456
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,160
Basically on my back foot. Is that what yeah? What's that what the saying is here? I put in my back foot and like whoa, you know

457
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm not quite sure where I'm out here and you know, did I just get used here or

458
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,360
Of course, I had nothing to do with it and in fact they've actually talked about this

459
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:02,920
He said you know, did you ask if you know if she's like transsexual or transgender? You know, can you imagine how embarrassed?

460
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
I would have been

461
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,760
If I'd actually ask the question, you know

462
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,080
Where's it's I think it's pretty clear that this is just a guy doing this

463
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,560
Madge Weinstein character and also that kind of then comes around to the cancer comment where I thought

464
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:27,320
I just really thought when when and if you haven't listened to all of you know all of these things in the podcast and you don't know what the hell I'm talking about but

465
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
a lot of you have I know so

466
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:41,480
You know, I figured Madge Weinstein really is serious about this yeast business and I probably just don't know enough about yeast and I still don't know if that's serious or not

467
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,960
But I guess not I really thought that you know, there's a serious problem with yeast. Hey, I'm gullible. What can I tell you? You know

468
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,280
There's all kinds of crappy sicknesses

469
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,080
I don't know and you know you've been talked about that on the source code

470
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,400
So I guess I just felt violated all around by

471
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,840
Some skit and you know, maybe

472
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,440
Madge had just just should have said before the phone call that we had hey, you know, by the way and I would have

473
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,680
You know, I would have done something with that. Maybe I would have disclosed or but

474
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:17,080
It just would have been better if I'd known a little bit more about it. So maybe that's my fault. Maybe I shouldn't call people up without knowing

475
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
more about them

476
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,640
bottom line. I listened to

477
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,960
Madge Weinstein not a regular yeast radio today

478
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,720
Which just came out because I still of course you know scan do a manual scan around this time

479
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:39,480
And it was the same person who I spoke to on the telephone. It was you know Madge Weinstein and

480
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,240
That's what this person called herself Madge Weinstein and

481
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
One thing I certainly know is that

482
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,320
Madge Weinstein certainly got certainly got them in my message and I think that

483
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
if we

484
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,120
We can probably just leave all that where it is and I'd love to hear

485
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
The Madge Weinstein that I

486
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
completely fell in love with

487
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,800
And I've been listening to every single time there's a new podcast

488
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,440
When it's about you know when it's the yeast radio

489
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,800
Madge Weinstein looking at the world talking about our job

490
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,640
That's what I I would love to hear and I certainly were made a big fan

491
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,200
If there's more a match like that that I can listen to the skits

492
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Not totally my deal

493
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,480
Nothing wrong with it do whatever you want and you know

494
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,520
Maybe they'll get better. I don't know but so that's just my input on all of that is that

495
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,120
I like the Madge Weinstein who was sitting there

496
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,880
Telling everyone off and going through the news and actually teaching me a little you know

497
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,160
Teach you me a few things about what's going on in the world in the United States. I don't certainly don't know

498
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
a lot about

499
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,520
Why don't I'm the element of different country you miss a lot of these cool things and insights and I think that

500
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:17,480
The Madge has a real good good eye for what's going on in the country so hope we get more of that and actually I guess what I should do now is

501
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,120
maybe just play a song

502
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
For y'all

503
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,120
Let me see what can I get anything nice that I can play here

504
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,680
Or should I just end it more like 40 minutes right that's pretty much it

505
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Oh

506
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
What shall I play

507
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Man

508
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,920
I don't think I have much in the way of

509
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,840
Something that'll fit I told you didn't have anything prepared

510
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Shoot

511
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
Okay

512
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,440
Yeah, oh oh wait a minute

513
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,400
I was gonna choose something but then I just saw another one of my play. That's a basic looking my eye tunes

514
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,800
to myself now hold on this is what I want to play hold on

515
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:23,080
I got patched this through from eye tunes man my Mac is so slow. I hope this doesn't affect the recording

516
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,600
Okay, and now we put the earphone in here. Let's see if we can

517
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Cut this

518
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
Yeah

519
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
This is 10cc

520
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
The things we do for love

521
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,800
Well, we do a lot here on your day in source code

522
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,120
But then you'll pay the price the things we do for love

523
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,680
I'm unication is the problem during our side

524
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,920
You got a number and a hand is on the wrong

525
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,960
The weather's time and all the lines are getting the things we do

526
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
The things we do

527
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,440
Like walking in the rain and snow

528
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:32,120
Wembers don't wear to go when you're feeling like a part of you is dying

529
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,360
Can you look at all the answer in the eyes

530
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,360
You think you're gonna break up and she says you want to make up

531
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
I

532
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,360
Walkin in the rain and snow

533
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,940
When there's nowhere to go

534
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,940
When you feel it like a part of you is tired

535
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,440
And you look it for all the answer in the right

536
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,440
You think you got to break out

537
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,440
That you said she wants to make up

538
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,440
I've got for miles with you all the time

539
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,440
I've got for miles with you all the time

540
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,440
The situation, a greedy, disciplined, and disciplined Lord

541
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,440
Well, after all, it's just a couple lines

542
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,440
Of the things we grew along, the things we grew along

543
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,440
The things we grew along, the things we grew along

544
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,440
The things we grew along, the things we grew along

545
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,440
The things we grew along, the things we grew along

546
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,440
The things we grew along, the things we grew along

547
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,440
The things we grew along, the things we grew along

548
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,440
The things we grew along, the things we grew along

549
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,440
Oh yeah, nothing like a little tendency scene

550
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,440
On what morning everybody?

551
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,440
The things we do for love

552
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,120
You may have been listening to this song on your Microsoft smartphone.

553
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,520
I'm not quite sure what a Microsoft smartphone is or what it looks like, but there's

554
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,720
a new iPod around linked into the directory, of course.

555
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,400
It's iPod here in that.

556
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Oh, shoot.

557
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Oh, crap.

558
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Sorry.

559
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
That's iTunes.

560
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,440
Of course you heard that iTunes continued to roll.

561
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:23,760
iPod or SP, this is the podcast and client for the MS smartphone.

562
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,240
And so basically, I guess the smartphone is kind of like a PDA with a phone and it

563
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,040
maybe that's what they call the XDA in Europe.

564
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,120
Well, guess what?

565
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,120
You can now receive podcasts on that.

566
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
It's cool.

567
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:43,040
I see that the iPod.org directory is integrated right into it.

568
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:50,600
I see in the screenshots that data source code is linked in, scripting, trade secrets

569
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,800
podcast and evil genius chronicles.

570
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,400
It has an progress bar.

571
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,400
OK, it says that it's still alpha quality.

572
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,680
But wow, this is great.

573
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,800
This is Andrew Davy, who I presume he did it.

574
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,600
He sent me the email.

575
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I'm pretty sure he created.

576
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,440
This is the, what, so this is version 0.2.

577
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:20,080
And you couldn't get it from equine.co.uk slash iPod or SP.

578
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,960
And I'll do this in aviation abbreviations, right?

579
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:32,000
So it's echo, Quebec, uniform, indian november.co.uk slash iPod or SP.

580
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,760
That's india poppa, Oscar Delta Delta, echo Romeo, sheriff poppa.

581
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,800
Oh boy, I can't wait to get those show notes up, I guess.

582
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,240
Maybe I shouldn't do any show notes, just write it down.

583
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,800
You know, rewind it, write it down if you want to know what that is.

584
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm too tired for, I'm too tired to do show notes.

585
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,560
So it looks really cool.

586
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,280
And now I guess I gotta go see if I can find a Microsoft smartphone.

587
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,640
Or is that only one model?

588
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,280
I don't know if it's a range of phones or it's just one model.

589
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,480
Regardless, very cool.

590
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,920
Excellent, excellent job.

591
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,640
OK, well, that's it.

592
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,640
If you don't mind, I will, uh, leave you with, uh,

593
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
the power of your intelligence.

594
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Yeah, everybody.

595
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,240
Uh, what else, now that's it.

596
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,640
Adam McCurry.com, that's what we can leave comment.

597
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,640
Uh, you can send me, uh,

598
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,640
if you want, you can even send me an audio comment.

599
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,640
I'll do a little bit behind on the email.

600
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,640
So maybe we should hang off for a few tears too.

601
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,640
The power of the door is closed.

602
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,640
And by the way, I really wish you could do something about the latency,

603
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,640
or the delay that is still in built-in doll podcasting systems.

604
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,640
Pretty soon, I'm just going to have to get an external mixer and an external recording

605
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:55,640
device and do it all off the computer because it's almost not doing any more.

606
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,640
Of course, they add all the crap.

607
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,640
Hey, these are my own problems.

608
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,640
You know, trying to solve them for your past.

609
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,640
Tomorrow, there will be another daily source code.

610
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,640
I hope to see you then.

611
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,640
Take care, everybody.

612
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,640
Good night, Incarnate.
