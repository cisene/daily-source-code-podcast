00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta Shara Charlie 213. Hello everybody. Welcome to the daily source code coming to you from San Francisco, California.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The time now is 17. Actually, I watched a little fast. It was about 15 a.m.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I am at the, I can actually, I can tell you where I'm at. I'm at the Pan Pacific Hotel, which is right near Union Square in San Francisco.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And I can tell you that now because by the time you hear this, it's Sunday night and it'll be Monday morning when you probably hear this or Monday afternoon. I've been checked out. So no sense,

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It makes no sense to call the, to call the hotel in the middle of the night and wake up, which has happened the last couple of times, I've actually mentioned where I was staying.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Today's been a production day for me.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Been very busy working on a number of projects.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:09,000
One is the Spike Lee inside man podcast, which is this concept that we have of a shadow cast. We have a shadow cast or follow someone around in this case. It's Spike Lee.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
On the set of his new movie inside man.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So I had some production to do on that as you know, I produced a lot of that on the plane actually on the way over from from London.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And excuse me. Oh, a sense of a moment.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I just finished up cutting all the tracks and doing the pre-production or the secondary part of pre-production,

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because the pre-production of course is the selecting of the shows and the clips.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Man, it's actually quite a lot of work goes into the, into the pod finder podcast.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll tell you about that as I take you on a trip of, I don't know, just to walk around the neighborhood here near my hotel,

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
which as I said is right near Union Square, famous for its shopping extravaganza.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You kind of get everything all in one spot here in San Francisco.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can walk one block and be in a neighborhood you might not want to be in around 130 in the morning.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I don't know really. I've never walked around at 130 in the morning, so let's go.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll tell you about everything that I've been doing.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's a really shitty door.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I'm on the 15th floor. This is a great hotel. It has an atrium.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So all the rooms are, it's kind of like the, you know, that's the watered 15 floors.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We're actually 12 floors below because the reception is on the third floor and the entrance to the hotel is on the first.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There was an atrium where all the rooms are kind of surrounding a central spot.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And we're going to take the elevator down and go out. It's chilly.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I have a sweater on. I didn't bring a coat. So I borrowed Ron Bloom's jacket.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have a sweater on, but still it's, no, it's going to be pretty chilly.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I think it was Mark Twain who said the coldest winter I ever witnessed was Summer in San Francisco.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Everything is going like cloth work. It's almost like gets smart here.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So these are beautiful glass elevators. And as we whisk down, I can actually see the floors flying by.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And it's really funky and we hit that third floor because it's a solid floor.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And you actually go right through the floor, kind of like a fireman on a pole.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There we go, pass reception, hello reception. Good bye reception.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And we're down at the ground level.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay, we're going to walk out the front door here.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Evening.

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay, here we go.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Anyway, the pod finder podcast. I just want to tell you what kind of production goes into that.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because it's pretty cool. Particularly, that we can actually do these kinds of productions now.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It used to be unthinkable. Maybe even five years ago, mainly held back by bandwidth constraints.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You see, I'm walking right now on, what is this?

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think this is this power. I believe. Maybe it's post road on.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's post no bills. That's where I am right now.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Walking through some construction here.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Wow. It's a real funky.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm walking us. You can tell I'm working on board.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going on very much like a scaffolding. You might see in New York City that you walk underneath.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Actually, I think I want to be going the other way towards Union Square.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to walk up to the corner here.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Or is it Taylor? I'm going to cross over.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So we've got a good idea of the sounds of San Francisco.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm the streets of San Francisco.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So the pod finder, the way it works is we have an editorial team.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The first looks at different podcasts. I put in some suggestions.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We kind of have a little ad hoc group meeting about what we want to feature on the show.

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
New shows, exciting new things that have happened.

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then we have to pull some clips from each show.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And we always look at the description field in the RSS feed.

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So we know how people want to describe their own podcast.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, what a bunch of noise here.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We're holding that.

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Man, big 18 meter.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So once we have that, then I basically put it into an outline.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And, you know, come up with an order.

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A run down of what I want to be in what spot.

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And then I write little intros and altros to each piece.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sometimes it's, you know, it's real copy that I'll stick to.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Sometimes it's just bullet points kind of depends on the podcast and what I feel about doing.

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Then I cut all the tracks.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then I upload that, including the outline to a central server.

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We're our production engineer.

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Then grabs everything and puts it all together.

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, as I said, there's just no way that this could have been done.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A couple of years ago, mainly because of the bandwidth constraints,

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
forget processor speed and great microphones and ways to record stuff on location

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
without slipping along entire studios.

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I may basically just have my Mac and my microphone combo.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The same one I'm using right now for the sound seeing tour of the streets of San Francisco.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And then Dave will put it all together.

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then he'll upload, you know, almost kind of like a final mix and we'll listen to it.

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then, of course, we still have to put the images in for the enhanced version of the podcast.

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
From the corner now of Mason and Post.

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So I cut the corner into the hotel.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm walking towards the Union Square.

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oops, a little wind here.

88
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Come on.

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And then the enhanced podcast is made.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And then we shoot it all up to the server, create the RSS feed,

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and notify Apple so that they can feature it in iTunes.

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So as I said, kind of chilly.

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What's interesting about San Francisco and I guess California in general

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
is that homeless people are everywhere.

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's not like New York City where homeless people are in certain areas.

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Here you can find homeless people anywhere, which areas for areas.

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Anyway, you can imagine.

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And what's kind of weird and really takes them getting used to.

99
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I'm still getting used to it.

100
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's how people just step over them.

101
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You know, just pass them by as if they don't exist.

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And they really are everywhere.

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In this time of night.

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Especially.

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like here at the corner.

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He's got a cup. You probably want some cash. He looks hammered.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What's up?

108
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm your last hope.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He's treating so good.

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm so glad I met a nice guy named.

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What's your name?

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My name is Will.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Will.

115
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's up, Will?

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Can I help you out there, brother?

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There you go, man.

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
One more for the stop there.

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
All right, buddy.

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Take care of yourself.

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
All right, buddy.

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So I was smart enough to come out and bring some singles.

125
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Now, I could do this all night long.

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You could be giving money to people that's really outrageous.

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Every single street corner.

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's someone asking for cash.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So, I don't have any policy about that.

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's probably not even a good thing to be handing it out.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But, you know, if someone has a nice approach

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and someone says, I'm the last hope.

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, what can you say is a good scenario?

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You know, you just got to do it.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I know walking has the same Francis,

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
famous hotel.

137
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Right across from Union Square,

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
which is packed.

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, there's some guys playing guitar over there.

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Maybe I'll, uh, maybe I'll head over.

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's see what they're doing.

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hey, listen to what they're playing.

143
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let me go check.

144
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That could be fun, all night.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm trying to sell these things. I can't find anything cash.

146
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I need $10 if you know anybody.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is one.

148
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's the start.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
One is all I got for now.

150
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh yeah.

151
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Can I have a listen?

152
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Can I have a listen in?

153
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No, no problem.

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What are you guys from?

155
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Rush it.

156
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm recording this. Is that okay?

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, no, no.

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay.

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's see what they're playing.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's play.

161
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Calm down.

162
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Calm down.

163
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't feel the same.

164
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Done.

165
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The sound sounded a little.

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Bony,

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's not a long still morning, it's a long day

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a long day, it's a long day

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry, I hope it falls today

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sorry, I hope it's so good

171
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry, I hope it falls today

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I hope it falls today

173
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I hope it falls today

174
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I hope it falls today

175
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm sorry, I hope it falls today

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I hope it falls today

177
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,760
I'm not listening.

178
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,680
I'm the one pleading Thank you.

179
00:15:34,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's great. What's it about?

186
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
What are the words about?

187
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
All songs, of course, are about love.

188
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Are you guys on vacation or?

189
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Yeah, students.

190
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Are you going to school here?

191
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:11,480
No, I'm not. I'm just working here for a couple of days and I live in London.

192
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,480
You can tell from my accent.

193
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
And do you like them?

194
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Yeah, very much.

195
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Yeah, it's great.

196
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
It's beautiful.

197
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Yeah, definitely.

198
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
What do you mean?

199
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Where have I?

200
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Cold.

201
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
At night.

202
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
It's very cold.

203
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Yeah.

204
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Where are you from in Russia?

205
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm from Europe.

206
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Where are you from?

207
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,480
It's between the European nation and something.

208
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Okay.

209
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Sorry.

210
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Moscow?

211
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Yeah.

212
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
I've been to Moscow.

213
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,480
In 1989,

214
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Was the Moscow Music Peace Festival.

215
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Remember at the Lenin Stadium?

216
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Yeah, yeah.

217
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Yeah.

218
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
I've been to Moscow.

219
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
I was the Osbourne,

220
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
and Motley Crew,

221
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,480
and I see Gorky Park.

222
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Those guys still around.

223
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Gorky Park?

224
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah.

225
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Do they still play the band?

226
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Yeah.

227
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Yeah.

228
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
It's just...

229
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Yeah.

230
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah.

231
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Cool.

232
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
You guys just...

233
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
You put out records or you make your own CDs or anything?

234
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
No.

235
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Just for fun.

236
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Just for fun.

237
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Everybody in Russia can play like this.

238
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Really?

239
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Yeah.

240
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
I don't love you.

241
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Well, it's only three chords.

242
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Four.

243
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Four chords.

244
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
That is beautiful.

245
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
It's beautiful.

246
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
All right, guys.

247
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
We'll have a good summer.

248
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Thank you.

249
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
All right.

250
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Take it easy.

251
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
All right.

252
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Bye-bye.

253
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
All right.

254
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,480
I guess that's a pod save, then.

255
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I didn't even ask him if it was there, so I guess it's there, I'm so.

256
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,480
So walking past Union Square,

257
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
only just do a little time check here.

258
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Okay.

259
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
We've been at it for about 20 minutes.

260
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Good.

261
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
That actually filled up some time.

262
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
I didn't even expect it.

263
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
And it was sound a pretty good.

264
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
It was guys, you know, all young.

265
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,480
I'd say they were in their early 20s.

266
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
leather jackets.

267
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Banged up guitars, pretty cool.

268
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Man, and while I was standing there, like three homeless people came up and

269
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,480
begging for money.

270
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,480
It really ruins your walk.

271
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,480
But then again, if you're homeless, you have no house.

272
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,480
That could fucking ruin your whole vibe, too.

273
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
It's just, it seems like something could be done, you know.

274
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Weird.

275
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Oh, looking at the signs here.

276
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Plenty of billboards.

277
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Big sex if they have a new store.

278
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Nike town.

279
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Sky, vodka.

280
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Please.

281
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,480
No comparison to absolute.

282
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,480
You know, the pod save music network is flavored by absolute all summer long.

283
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Came in across over here.

284
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,480
This is Stockton.

285
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,480
So I'll go from Stockton over to Gary.

286
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm sure I don't get run over.

287
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Let's see.

288
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Or does that a fire truck or police?

289
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I can't sell.

290
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,480
I got a green light, so I'm growing.

291
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Okay.

292
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,480
This is the corner of Gary and Stockton.

293
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,480
I'll walk down and then we'll do a big circle back up to the hotel and see what else

294
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,480
we encounter on our.

295
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Sound seeing two of the streets of San Francisco.

296
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
You know, I was talking to Brian.

297
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
He's our director of operations on the show.

298
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,480
And you said, you know, it's, you feel so safe in San Francisco.

299
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,480
And I said, have you ever watched the streets of San Francisco?

300
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
And he's 32, I think.

301
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,480
And I realized, yeah, I'm an old-fucker.

302
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,480
That was a series that had the.

303
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Michael Douglas starred in that.

304
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,480
It was a cop series called the streets of San Francisco.

305
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Solving crimes.

306
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Hainest crimes.

307
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,480
I'm at Macy's now.

308
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
I'm going to.

309
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Turn right here.

310
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
The corner of Macy's.

311
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,480
On the side of the corner is Creighton Barrel.

312
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
I'm wondering if I should.

313
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I walked down one more.

314
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Big 18 wheeler.

315
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Hey, I'm going to.

316
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,480
It says don't walk or it has the red hand, but.

317
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
I think it's pretty safe to cross.

318
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,480
And walk down towards if you know San Francisco, the kind of know where I am.

319
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,480
So I'm still on the Stockton.

320
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,480
I'm going to walk down to, I think, that's market.

321
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Yeah.

322
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
The market.

323
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
My goodness.

324
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I already know my way around.

325
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Hey, it looks like I might have found an apartment here.

326
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
For.

327
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
For when I'm staying.

328
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Isn't we spending a lot of time in San Francisco.

329
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
And really excited.

330
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
We put an offer in.

331
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Hopefully it'll be accepted.

332
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Um.

333
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Actually, I posted a picture of the view from the living room on my weblog.

334
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
And people thought it was a hotel.

335
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,480
It's an apartment that I really hope I could.

336
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I can get.

337
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Hi, is the apple store here?

338
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
It's a guy in the apple store.

339
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
I'm sitting there reading the book.

340
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Okay.

341
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Now we're going to.

342
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
What do we do?

343
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
This is Ellis.

344
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
So what I'll do is I'll.

345
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
One more.

346
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Go to market.

347
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,480
The sidewalk is being sprayed clean here.

348
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,480
It's one of California's savings.

349
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
I don't want to get wet.

350
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,480
So I'll cross over past market.

351
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Across the trolley tracks.

352
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Right in front of the good old Navy store.

353
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,480
It's deserted.

354
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Completely fricking deserted.

355
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,480
No one on the street, but.

356
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Almost people.

357
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Me.

358
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,480
And you guys along for the ride.

359
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Maybe we'll find some more interesting people to talk to.

360
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
You notice how I asked those Russian kids.

361
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
It was okay that I was recording.

362
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Kind of learned my lesson from the yeah.

363
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Elevator sound seeing tour in the wall to restore it.

364
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Oh, I got so much flag.

365
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
True.

366
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
I guess I should.

367
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Related.

368
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Maybe we still need some kind of.

369
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm podcasting.

370
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Blinking light.

371
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Next to the lapel microphone.

372
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Oh, man.

373
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
Had a late dinner.

374
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
So this walking is.

375
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Reminding me that I had that.

376
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Give me many sense.

377
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Let's see.

378
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Shall we do?

379
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Shall we go?

380
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,480
There's a walking past a bus stop.

381
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,480
Person sleeping in there with a shopping cart.

382
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,480
It really is sad.

383
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,480
And it's something to do with the policy of California that this.

384
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Isn't dealt with.

385
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
It's also the policy of the United States I guess.

386
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,480
You don't see many homeless people in.

387
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
What even in London?

388
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Just don't see it that much.

389
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
Let me see.

390
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,480
I'm going to cross back over here.

391
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm going to cross market again going back towards the hotel general direction.

392
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Can you hear 21?

393
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,480
No.

394
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Oh, this is the place where the cable cars turn around.

395
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,480
And they don't really turn around, but they hit a plateau.

396
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,480
And it's kind of like a lazy Susan.

397
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:52,480
And it twists around and spins them back in the direction they came from.

398
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,480
I'm sorry to say there's just not a lot going on right now.

399
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,480
This would be power, I guess.

400
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,480
So we'll walk up power.

401
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,480
And see.

402
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
What else are we talking about?

403
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,480
What else is going on?

404
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Well, I'll be going back Tuesday afternoon.

405
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,480
So it'll have been exactly a week, which I think is pretty much going to be my schedule

406
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,480
for the foreseeable future.

407
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
It'll be kind of like a working on an oil rig.

408
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
You know, one week on three weeks off.

409
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Although, of course, it won't really be off.

410
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,480
It'll be, you know, source codes and all kinds of stuff.

411
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Lots of production and we're ramping up with even more.

412
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Okay.

413
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
Where am I now?

414
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Power.

415
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,480
So if this is power, then post is going to...

416
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
No, power is what my hotel is on.

417
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
I think.

418
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
I think that's what it is.

419
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Yeah.

420
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Okay.

421
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Hope my battery holds out.

422
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I did so much recording today that the transmitter battery

423
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Counted out on me.

424
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,480
I think I was another guy.

425
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,480
How you doing?

426
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Oh, my goodness.

427
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Just doesn't stop.

428
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:43,480
People going through garbage cans.

429
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Unbelievable.

430
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,480
It's not that you don't feel safe for anything.

431
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,480
It's just like weird.

432
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Okay.

433
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Coming up to...

434
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Oh, yeah.

435
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
People screaming up here.

436
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Always find the check that out.

437
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Let me see.

438
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Oh, you don't want to go that way.

439
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Doing a total J walk.

440
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Okay.

441
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
We'll continue up.

442
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Power.

443
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Man, everyone's closed down.

444
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,480
All kinds of cultures.

445
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,480
All kinds of people out on the street at night.

446
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
It's trash night.

447
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
That's for sure.

448
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Well, maybe this is just your regular trash.

449
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Man, he wouldn't kind produces a load of crap.

450
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Bags and bags piled high here.

451
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Okay.

452
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Let's see what we are.

453
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
This is Gary.

454
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Okay.

455
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
I got my bearings now.

456
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
So...

457
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Oh, what am I getting here?

458
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,480
My MBA is talking to me.

459
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,480
That's something pretty interesting.

460
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I've noticed.

461
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Let me see.

462
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
What should I do?

463
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Go up one.

464
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Something I noticed is that San Francisco is without a doubt.

465
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,480
One of the most wired cities.

466
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Got the MBA, which has Wi-Fi built right into it.

467
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,480
A little pocket PC, phone, combo.

468
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,480
It has GPRS.

469
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,480
But you walk around the streets here and has an auto discovery mode for Wi-Fi.

470
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,480
And you just turn it on.

471
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
And it just...

472
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
You know, I'll do it now.

473
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
The networks just start appearing.

474
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
It's outrageous.

475
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,480
It's going to turn on to...

476
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Wireless manager.

477
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Okay.

478
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Let's see.

479
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Scanning the network.

480
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Now it should just start popping up with all different kinds of access points.

481
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I hope at least.

482
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Sometimes you have to...

483
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Like all good pocket PCs.

484
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Sometimes you have to reset it.

485
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,480
But it actually works properly.

486
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Don't see.

487
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Don't see anything coming through, which immediately makes me think that I have to reset it.

488
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,480
So let me do that now.

489
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Okay.

490
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Okay.

491
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Okay, it's reset.

492
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,480
There's the theater.

493
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Two big 18 wheelers up there.

494
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
One for Lemis.

495
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Lemis are ably.

496
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
They're unloading.

497
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I'll walk over there for a sec.

498
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
And listen to some of the unloading going on.

499
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
It might be something interesting.

500
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,480
We continue to scan for Wi-Fi.

501
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Oh, they're loading in.

502
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
What are they loading in?

503
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Looks like they're loading in.

504
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Ringing.

505
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Yeah.

506
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Okay, I'm scanning for Wi-Fi again.

507
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Big pieces of set are going into the trucks.

508
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:32,480
I wonder if the run is over on the pack and it is.

509
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Okay, let me check my wireless manager here.

510
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,480
If you in the pocket PC boots up,

511
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,480
takes a while for it to figure out what it has to do

512
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,480
and what it has to display.

513
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,480
It's not a very rewarding process.

514
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Okay, so I've got the Wi-Fi manager running.

515
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
It's scanning for networks.

516
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
See if we can find something.

517
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,480
Okay, nothing going on with a loaded.

518
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:28,480
There we go.

519
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Airpath, Union Square Wireless, Wayport Access.

520
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,480
And I'm sure I can connect to at least one of those three.

521
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:50,480
A lot of free Wi-Fi here in San Francisco, which is extremely cool.

522
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,480
So I'm going to keep watching the MBA.

523
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Now I can hear the phone park clicking.

524
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:14,480
That's pretty dead out here.

525
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,480
It's a nice folks.

526
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I'm actually not that cold.

527
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,480
It was cold or a couple of nights ago.

528
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,480
It's quite nice.

529
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:34,480
A little bit of wind just puts the chill in the air.

530
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,480
There you get something here.

531
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Still waiting to see if we can get a hit on the Wi-Fi.

532
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Probably if I go to Union Square that Union Square Wireless will pop up again.

533
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,480
But it works, you know.

534
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,480
I have been using it quite successfully.

535
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Just about everywhere you go.

536
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Within a 50 foot radius.

537
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:14,480
You're able to find an access point that is very usable.

538
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,480
We are now passing B.C.A.B.J.

539
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
A high-fession.

540
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,480
Rounding the corner back on Powell.

541
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Moving back up past St. Francis.

542
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,480
I'm going to put the MBA back in my pocket.

543
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,480
Wait, Google Wi-Fi?

544
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
It just doesn't stop.

545
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,480
I wonder if there's a Google office here somewhere.

546
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,480
One of these days.

547
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:57,480
We'll do a full sound scene tour where we stop at each Wi-Fi access point.

548
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:04,480
See if we can get a little bit of war walking instead of war driving.

549
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Up to the corner.

550
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Now bum no fucking cigarette off we do.

551
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Okay, Disney store here at the corner.

552
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,480
And we're going to go back towards the hotel.

553
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Which I can see up in the distance.

554
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Another quick Wi-Fi check.

555
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Just for the heck of it.

556
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,480
That's beeping at me, which means you've found something.

557
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,480
But it's cool how it'll show you a list of sometimes five access points just sitting there,

558
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,480
waiting to be used.

559
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:06,480
And I've noticed there's a lot of access points named net gear and linksis.

560
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Which is just the standard names.

561
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,480
That's why they're all on secure.

562
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Your heart always leaps of joy when you see some access point called linksis or net gear.

563
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,480
It's guaranteed I'm on.

564
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Okay.

565
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Right there may not be anything to receive here.

566
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Okay, back in the pocket.

567
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:43,480
The MDA goes through back at the corner of Mason and Post at the Pam Pacific hotel.

568
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,480
And we've been at it for probably about, what is it?

569
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,480
About 30 minutes now? 40 minutes.

570
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
So.

571
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Perfect time.

572
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
I'll take you back up to my room.

573
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Hey, baby.

574
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Want to come up to my room.

575
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Take you back to my room.

576
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,480
And then we'll turn it off.

577
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Compress this sucker into an MP3 and get it up.

578
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:22,480
I'm cleaning off the signage here at the Pam Pacific.

579
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Here we go.

580
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
We're back.

581
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Unstave.

582
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,480
No harm.

583
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,480
And a nice little evening walk.

584
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Which is good.

585
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,480
It's really good to get out.

586
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,480
After sitting in the room for so long.

587
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,480
Come on.

588
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,480
Here we go.

589
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Back up to the 15th floor.

590
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,480
You can hear the acoustics change immediately.

591
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,480
Up we go.

592
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Count the floors with me now.

593
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Here the beats.

594
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Not very audible, actually.

595
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Okay.

596
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:31,480
And we'll have my stuff.

597
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,480
The hotel is officially asleep.

598
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Nothing going on.

599
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Two AM.

600
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,480
And we're almost done.

601
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Get my key card.

602
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Someone has a nice little cup of decaf.

603
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,480
While I check the show for any errors.

604
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Well, it's compressing.

605
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,480
We've got to open up the window.

606
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
A little stuffy.

607
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Air condition is not a big thing here.

608
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,480
There's some kind of cooling unit here on the wall.

609
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Let me see if I can, yeah, 71.

610
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
You want to be a little bit cooler than that.

611
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Okay.

612
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,480
Well, once again, thank you very much for joining me on the sound seeing tour on the streets

613
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,480
of San Francisco.

614
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Tuesday.

615
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
We'll be tomorrow.

616
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,480
We'll bring you yet another daily source code.

617
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
And feedback.

618
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Always appreciated.

619
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Adam at curie.com.

620
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
DailySourceCode.com is the website.

621
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,480
We can pick up the podcast feed, the archives, the new show.

622
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,480
And of course, you can also subscribe through iTunes to get to this show.

623
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
42 minutes.

624
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Almost on the nose.

625
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
I'll talk to you tomorrow, everybody.

626
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Bye-bye.
