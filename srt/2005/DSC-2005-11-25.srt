00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta Sierra Charney 2-8-6

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Timmy, you see that?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Holy information you don't yet have!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Adam Curry!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
$16 million worth of airplane trapped to my ass!

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We don't need no speaking gritty!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future!

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I guess it is Adam Curry!

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One, two, three!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm counting on you!

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm counting on you!

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm counting on you!

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, sure!

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Maybe it was Thanksgiving, but that doesn't mean that we're going to skip our Friday celebrations now, doesn't it?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't want to!

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't want to!

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Stop down, drive it around from Gilford, the Curry Cottage!

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is the Daddy Source Code, it is Friday, kick it off with Josh Woodward!

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Incoherent!

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How you doing?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This illusion broken but you know it's intense!

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Holy truth!

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You hear like an explosion!

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And the smiles on all the faces of the children

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
of just a moment that we lost in the police!

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Are you trying to keep it falling tacky with the number of it's wine?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Will it bounce or break?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There's some on the sidewalk!

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And a sticky hushes weasel dim in the corner of the brain!

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now it's time to live away and look for me here!

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, it's clear it's not nearly twice as big!

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's out of reaching heavy as a brick!

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, it's quick to make a noise and no,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you'll rub our gun and all the elements!

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Getting so much water and the tea!

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, it's clear it's not nearly twice as big!

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000

It's not nearly twice as big!

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

It's not nearly twice as big!

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not nearly twice as big!

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
It's not nearly twice as big!

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:34,680
What you say I don't want to say to me

86
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:43,680
What you say I want you to say to me

87
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:52,680
What you say I want you to say to me

88
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,680
What you say I want you to say to me

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:11,680
I can't be your world I can't be your world

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
I can't be your world

91
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Joshua would work in co-harons founded on the ultimate mix podcast

92
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,680
And shuttle went over to the podcast piece of network and picked up a copy

93
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Excellent song kick off today's source code

94
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Okay, so the power was off earlier, hold on a second

95
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Everything sounds like shit now

96
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Oh man

97
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Hold on, let me see if I can get some boost back

98
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Does this help?

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I have no idea what I'm doing

100
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Okay, well, it sounds a little bit

101
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,680
I don't know if it's my voice or if it's just nasal and general or whatever's going on

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Doesn't matter

103
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,680
How you doing? Hope you had a great Thanksgiving

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Oh man, it's really, it sounds crappy

105
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Damn

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
I don't know if I can get over this

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Hold on, let me try, let me try doing that a little

108
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Put a little bit of low end, a little more

109
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm missing something in the mid-range somewhere

110
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Oh wait a minute, maybe that's it

111
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
No, that's down

112
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,680
It's so hard to listen to your own voice

113
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,680
And then think if you see if you can get the settings right

114
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
So it sounds right

115
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Okay, I don't think I have much more to do

116
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,680
And now the secondary headphones aren't working

117
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
That's nice

118
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,680
I was in gun invite Patricia up to talk about some TV stuff

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Oh man, the reverb is all over the place

120
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Ah

121
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Okay, never you mind

122
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
It'll all work out in the end

123
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,680
So we didn't celebrate Thanksgiving yesterday

124
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
In the United Kingdom

125
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
In fact, I think it's as Aaron Hastings email

126
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
The US Independence Day is when the Brits celebrate Thanksgiving

127
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,680
It's funny because people called me from the States and said

128
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Hey, happy Thanksgiving, are you celebrating?

129
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
You got your family

130
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Well, we don't have any family that lives here

131
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
And I said, you know, it's not really like a holiday over here

132
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
People don't really celebrate Thanksgiving

133
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
They said really why

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
So we'll do you know the story of Thanksgiving?

135
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Yeah, you know the pilgrims and we sat down

136
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Uh-huh, but do you know the whole story?

137
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Like, you know, the year before that

138
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,680
At the pilgrims, it basically shot the bird at the UK

139
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
At Britain and left

140
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Oh yeah, yeah, that doesn't make a lot of sense

141
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Exactly

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
So amongst all of this crap, what I did figure out

143
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Because it what happened as the electrician came over

144
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
And finally fixed all the lights and all the stuff that's wrong here

145
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
And I discovered where that mysterious hum was coming from

146
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
God, this sounds so horrible

147
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
I don't know what to do about it

148
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
I really don't

149
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,680
I wish I could make myself sound more just better

150
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Um, the horrible hum was coming from Patricia's jewelry cabinet

151
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Which has built in dimmed lighting

152
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,680
And I really only discovered it by accident

153
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
I was sitting in the studio the other night

154
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
And Patricia was ready to go to bed

155
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
So she turned off the dimmer and also like, wow

156
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
The hum just went away because I had the speaker still on

157
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
But there was nothing playing

158
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
And that's how we figured it out

159
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
And so that's the one thing he didn't fix

160
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Fix everything else

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
So the washing machine works the lights in the bathroom

162
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
We're working

163
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,680
And except for my entire mixer being a deprogrammed

164
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Everything else is pretty cool

165
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Help this is from Matthew Kneeble

166
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Hey Adam, this is Matthew Eble

167
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Podsafe musician and self-abound stone or super geek

168
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Hey, a while back you would mention something along the lines

169
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Of a podshow polusa

170
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Some kind of concert or tour with a bunch of podsafe artists

171
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Like me and the brother love chance

172
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,680
And all the other people that have been popping up on the podsafe music network

173
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Is there any truth to rumors that something like that is in the works

174
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,680
Because you know I've already got my bags pack and the posters printed up

175
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,680
And I'm waiting for the tour of us to roll up to my house

176
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,680
My roommates are starting to get annoyed that I have all my internet on the front lawn

177
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,680
So let's get rolling with this

178
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,680
Anyway, something else

179
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,680
My roommates mentioned to me recently that she had been hearing your name

180
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Obviously because I play the daily source code a lot

181
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,680
She'd been hearing Adam Curry hit Adam Curry this and the podfather that and Adam Curry

182
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
And she knew you were on MTV back in the day

183
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
And that kind of thing

184
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
She recently admitted to me that every time she heard your name

185
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
She pictured Kurt Loader

186
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Yeah, is that a bad thing?

187
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Get back to us on that

188
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Anyway, that was a good idea

189
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,680
It's a kickass show and I'm looking forward to the next episode

190
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Thanks a lot

191
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Oh yeah, and don't forget to check out my new album, Beer & Coffee

192
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Oh yeah

193
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh yeah

194
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
You see how quickly I snuck that in there

195
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
You see it's the old slam and plug trick

196
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
That's what it is

197
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
No, that's not okay

198
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Of course not

199
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Are you crazy?

200
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Are you nuts?

201
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Go slap her around for me, will ya?

202
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Let me see

203
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
The Curry Cruiser

204
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,680
We're supposed to pick that up yesterday

205
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Actually Eric came over yesterday on the Thanksgiving celebrations

206
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,680
To pick up the A8 driving back to Holland

207
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Actually he came over the day before he slept over

208
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,680
And we're supposed to pick up the Curry Cruiser yesterday

209
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,680
But international bank transfers

210
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Since you know my money is in other countries

211
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Take up to four days

212
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,680
And that's what's happening in the UK

213
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
And if you do it from the States no problem

214
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
But if it comes from any other country then the United States

215
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
You can take up to four days

216
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,680
I don't know maybe the screen to see if I have al-Qaeda ties or something like that

217
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
But it really sucks because we have no car

218
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Patricia got caught yesterday in a hailstorm

219
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Oh man

220
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,680
It started hailing and I'm sitting here in my big green chair

221
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
And the minute I thought to myself oh man

222
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
I hope Patricia doesn't get caught

223
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
And that because she'd walked to the hairdresser

224
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
She was walking back

225
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,680
And three seconds later my phone rings

226
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
I can hear this

227
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Oh my goodness

228
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
So we have no car

229
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,680
But Louis from the Jack dealer apparently is going to help me up

230
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
And hook us up with some car for the weekend

231
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
If the money doesn't show up today

232
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
And I guess then by Monday it'll be in

233
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Ah, that was

234
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Let's see

235
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
I'll tell you why

236
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Why don't I roll out a boatload of promos here

237
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
I invited Patricia to come and talk about some television stuff

238
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
We've been watching

239
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
So hopefully she'll have a nice cup of tea ready

240
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
And even though the headphones don't work

241
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
I've got a proper mic set up for

242
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
So let's see if we can get her on the show

243
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Stay tuned

244
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680

Hey Adam

312
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Is this the sound of vegetarianism?

313
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
I just wish that we could all be peaceful

314
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,680
And harmonious like the little bunnies in the field

315
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Or is this the sound of vegetarianism?

316
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Yes

317
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Neither Adam

318
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,680

That's a bit much

332
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,680
The world is in a flaming whole of real

333
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,680
But I'm here to ask you all to listen to my podcast

334
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
If the world is up, the world is up

335

If the story is still true, now come the place to share your love

336
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Ciao

337
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
Okay, Curry, good cue and way to go, dude

338
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
Let me see if I can hear Patricia Holna

339
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
I'll open up the other microphone

340
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
I think she's still talking on the phone

341
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Damn it

342
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
She doesn't care about the show, man

343
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
She just doesn't care

344
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,680
You know, all this pod safe music stuff that's been going on

345
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,680
And just the whole creation of the pod safe music network

346
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,680
And all the fantastic energy that's taking place in and around it

347
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Has why does it sound like I'm talking out of my ass?

348
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Uh, uh, one, two, one, two

349
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
God damn it, this sounds like shit

350
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,680
Hello, hello, hello, hello

351
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,680
It sounds horrible, what is going on?

352
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Why doesn't it one, two, one, two, three, one, two, three

353
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
I don't know, leave it something like that

354
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Okay

355
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
So with all this pod safe music stuff that's going on

356
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
I've discovered something

357
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,680
Actually, I'm able to now finally rediscover music

358
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,680
I'm learning things about music that I didn't know before

359
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,680
I have a whole new appreciation

360
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,680
I used to be, um, I wouldn't even back in the day

361
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
When I was just in encased by the hits

362
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Which would be during the day at MTV

363
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,680
And then on weekends I'd do a shift at Z100

364
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
And you know, that's really, you've got the hits

365
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
And you're head then man, let me tell you

366
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Um, then, you know, just it was hits all around me

367
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Continuously

368
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,680
And for some reason, you lock off portions of your brain

369
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
They become numb to new stimuli

370
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
And if it isn't, you know, if it isn't something that

371
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,680
I don't know, it's very, very hard to explain

372
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
It's taken me years at this point to get out of that

373
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
And it actually was like a whole deep programming process

374
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
It's so hard to explain

375
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,680
But finally, now I feel that I'm so liberated in just my listening

376
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Forget what I can do with podcasting

377
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,680
And, you know, I could go on about that forever

378
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Obviously, but just as a listener enjoying music

379
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Listening to other people talk about music

380
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,680
And then hearing that music and being able to go and download it myself

381
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm going to play it on my own show

382
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
And I don't know

383
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,680
And also Patricia keeps walking into my, into the office here

384
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
More and more frequently saying, hey, that sounds pretty cool

385
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
You know, it's just something is going on

386
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
There's a real excitement in the air

387
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
There's just something tingling

388
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,680
You can feel it in your fingertips, you know

389
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,680
So, as well, for the, the pod save Christmas song

390
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Which now I'm going to call pod save for peace

391
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
I don't know why, but

392
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
That's catchy, isn't it?

393
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Pod save for peace

394
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,680
And proceeds go to UNICEF

395
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Music for UNICEF, pod save for UNICEF is better

396
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Pod save for peace sounds so good though

397
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Okay, well, you know, help me out the side there

398
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Maybe we'll come up with a new one as we go along

399
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,680
So now I'm hearing different pod save artists who have podcasts

400
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
All over the place

401
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,680
Talking about the vocals that they're doing for the song

402
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Here's a piece from, uh, what is this?

403
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,680
This is from a Derek Miller, I used from his pod

404
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Kind of like the backing track that's loud provided us

405
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
To sing along with

406
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
That's not what the final version is going to sound like

407
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
It's just me with a backing track with some guide vocals

408
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,680
So here you can give a listen to my high, my low, together

409
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
And then the backing track

410
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Uh, hope you enjoy it, sounds kind of weird to start with

411
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
But here we go

412
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,680
What if every day

413
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,680
We're Christmas

414
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,680
What I wonder for well

415
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,680
This would be

416
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,680
We would never feel blue

417
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,680
We'd make all our dreams come true

418
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
If Christmas

419
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,680
We're every day

420
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,680
The low part

421
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,680
The member Patricia was saying about how it

422
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,680
It was not the right key for her

423
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Listen how low Derek has to go to hit the notes

424
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
He's really hurt

425
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,680
We would never feel blue

426
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,680
We'd make all our dreams come true

427
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
If Christmas

428
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
We're every day

429
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
All right, together

430
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,680
What if every day

431
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
We're Christmas

432
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,680
What I wonder for well

433
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,680
This would be

434
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,680
We would never feel blue

435
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,680
We'd make all our dreams come true

436
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
If Christmas

437
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
And if you're ready for it

438
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Here's the music

439
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Here we go

440
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
All right

441
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Everybody know

442
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Christmas

443
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Excellent

444
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
All right, so I can't wait to hear this

445
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,680
I finally got the proper tracks into slow

446
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,680
The ones without the reverbs

447
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
He could actually do something with them

448
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
With the tracks that Patricia did

449
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
And I think his cutoff date is today

450
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,680
That everything is supposed to be pretty much done

451
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Oh man, I cannot wait to hear the final product

452
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
I think December 1st

453
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
It was like his drop dead date that

454
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Brother Love told me that

455
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Really looking forward to it

456
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
All right, let's play some

457
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Some other pod safe music here for a second

458
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
This is

459
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I don't even know where I heard this one

460
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
But

461
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Even though it's long

462
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Which of course means you can skip over

463
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
But I suggest you listen to the whole thing

464
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Because it really builds in a nice way

465
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Patricia walked in on this song

466
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,680
And she said, hey, sounds a bit like Bowie

467
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Well, she could know

468
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
This is beggars town

469
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,680
If we come

470
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,680
What am I supposed to spice

471
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Even I believed

472
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,680
All my lives

473
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,680
But I found no one

474
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Now I'm biting my own tongue

475
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I'm not off to rights

476
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,680
But once again I'm wrong

477
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,680
So brought the blame on me

478
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,680
It doesn't matter anymore

479
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,680
You say the damage has been done

480
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:30,680
I see I love what's already flow

481
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,680
In beggars town

482
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Now I'm dismatized

483
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,680
In beggars town

484
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:52,680
In beggars town

485
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,680
In beggars town

486
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,680
In beggars town

487
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,680
In beggars town

488
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Everything I know

489
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
And love

490
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,680
I was hoping I could forget

491
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,680
You are a new list to me now

492
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,680
There's no cure and I'm addicted to you yet

493
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Who can have depend upon

494
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,680
To get me out of this

495
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,680
You've got the sweetest smile

496
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,680
There's such a poison's kiss

497
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,680
My hands are shaking with rage

498
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,680
It's too late now to negotiate

499
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,680
For all the love has turned to hate

500
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,680
And it seems without a trace

501
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,680
For the blame on me

502
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,680
It doesn't matter anymore

503
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,680
You say the damage has been done

504
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,680
I see I love what's already flow

505
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,680
In beggars town

506
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Now I'm dismatized

507
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,680
In beggars town

508
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,680
In beggars town

509
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,680
In beggars town

510
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,680
In beggars town

511
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,680
In beggars town

512
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,680
So this is what we are

513
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,680
And this is what we've been through

514
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,680
I've been nothing left to give

515
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,680
I give everything ahead to you

516
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:18,680
There's no cure and I'm addicted to you

517
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:26,680
There's such a poison's kiss

518
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,680
In beggars town

519
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,680
In beggars town

520
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,680
In beggars town

521
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,680
In beggars town

522
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,680
I can just hear Jason Kelcanus yelling now at his iPod

523
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
I want to hear only the talking bits on the daily source code

524
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
I don't want to hear all the mash up

525
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Ten on all the bonsai he think he and the promo

526
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
I want to hear all that

527
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Dude

528
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,680
It's called advertising

529
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm forcing you to listen

530
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Get through all the crap to listen to the good bits

531
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,680
That was a hollow horse from the pod save music network beggars town

532
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Music.podshow.com

533
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,680
I was talking actually not talking but I was emailing with Chris Rockwell

534
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
From the daily download

535
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
Dude when you get another poop cast

536
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Yes, so many poop cast fans who just can't believe that he hasn't posted a new show

537
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
And such a long time

538
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,680
So he's leading the charge on the development of the pod save music network

539
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,680
And I said, you know, when do we think we're going to have a lot of these pieces up

540
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,680
We've been talking about and he said, I'm thinking Christmas

541
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Wow

542
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,680
So I sure hope so dude

543
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,680
That would be awesome if we could have it by the new year even

544
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
I'd be extremely happy

545
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Speaking of pod save music networks and feedback here from Ken Irman

546
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Yo Adam

547
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,680
I've been spinning the power steppers from the pod save music network

548
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,680
And Colin from the van sent me an email to say thanks for the spins

549
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,680
You know how that works right?

550
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
If you're a pod cast when you sign up of the pod save music network

551
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Then you report that you played the song

552
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,680
And then the pod save music artist receives an email that you played it

553
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
So we had exchanged a couple emails

554
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Then I got an email from him to which he attached to station identification piece

555
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,680
He recorded for me with a sweet singer and everything

556
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I didn't ask him to

557
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
How freaking cool is that you can hear it in the promo?

558
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Actually the promo was really long

559
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
No way it wasn't that long

560
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Is this the right promo?

561
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Am I thinking of the right thing?

562
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Hold on

563
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Oh

564
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Oops

565
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
That didn't work

566
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
I just clicked on the

567
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
No, that's not what I wanted

568
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Hold on a second

569
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Is this the promo?

570
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Yo, it's Ken Irman for the bragging job I'm showing

571
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
By the name of staff, I groggy job with that TV

572
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Where you can check out some of my TV shows that I've been producing

573
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Some of my photo shop work on my thicker photo stream

574
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
And of course my pod cast

575
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Or I play a light back track

576
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Because I'm a laid back cat

577
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
The coffee's always fresh in the music's always pod save

578
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,680
I'm doing my best to make pod cast that I want to listen to

579
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Interesting and real enough to enjoy with rich sounding music

580
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Like I can listen to while I'm thinking out in cold monkey mode

581
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
A sort of iris spied me long

582
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Should music to generate a single single review

583
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
Yeah

584
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,680
Yo, I've been spending power stuff for his baby long cow voice

585
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
Danger to the shut-ups

586
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Danger stronger just getting a shield

587
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
And you know what?

588
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
And it's one of the things to be judged right

589
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Sound good you

590
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Come on by the groggy job at dot TV's website

591
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Check out a couple episodes to the groggy job show

592
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,680
And by the way, I know I got to finish the squirrel 100 TV series

593
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Everyone's been bugging me

594
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
The very second I had two hours to spare

595
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
I will get the next episode out of the door

596
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Yo, got her run, talks in

597
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
Bad

598
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
So it goes on to say

599
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
The pod cast community is freaking cool

600
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,680
Two months into it, I've already been meeting so many really nice people

601
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,680
I really feel like I've joined the community

602
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
You bet buddy

603
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Thank you so much for being point man and lightning rod

604
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
I don't know if that's good

605
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Alright, peace shot

606
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
AKA

607
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Croggie Java

608
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Lots of feedback about

609
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
We were talking about with

610
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Yeah, I was talking about Christina

611
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
How she's so forgetful and

612
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Doesn't seem to respect a lot of from mom's stuff

613
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Neil Gorman sent me a beautiful email

614
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,680
He said he heard some of the

615
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
What's the right word?

616
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,680
I'll say issues you're having with your 15 year old child

617
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
I wanted to take a moment and send you a thought

618
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
I went through my head as I listened

619
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Even though I don't have any kids in my own because of my job

620
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm around lots of teenagers on a regular basis

621
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
I work with lots of troubled teens

622
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Who come mainly from the west side of Chicago

623
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Many of them have been gang involved

624
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Abused, participated in violent crime

625
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
Or lost control over the lies because they

626
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Became dependent on drugs and alcohol

627
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
To feel normal

628
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Quote

629
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
To function

630
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,680
I'm not talking about smoking a little bit of weed

631
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
I'm talking about much more serious stuff

632
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Anyway, I just wanted to say that if the main problems

633
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
You're having arc Christina being forgetful

634
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
Or absent minded

635
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Hey baby

636
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Thank you

637
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
Hey

638
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Hey

639
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Hello

640
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Hop in front of the mic

641
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
I was just reading that email

642
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
You know what?

643
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
I'll tell you

644
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Hey

645
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
No, despite the way you have a microphone

646
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
I do

647
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
I do

648
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
You have headphones that work

649
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
You knew I was coming

650
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
I told you

651
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Yeah

652
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
I was invited for tea

653
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Yes

654
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
I was just reading that email

655
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
The guy I said

656
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
You said

657
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
The main problems

658
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,680
You are having with Christina being forgetful or absent minded

659
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
But where she put stuff

660
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,680
You put your shark clearly doing a great job of being parents

661
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Christina is very lucky kid to have you both

662
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Wow

663
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Yeah, that's nice

664
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,680
And we are because last night we went to the parent teacher conference

665
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Yes

666
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
And

667
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Didn't we actually one point say

668
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Are you talking about the same girl?

669
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Don't touch your breasts

670
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,680
No, I was itching on the nipple

671
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Uh-huh

672
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Yeah

673
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Uh-huh

674
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
No, we actually

675
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
A curry

676
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
See you

677
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
Yeah, I see you

678
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
All right

679
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Same curry

680
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
And they said yes

681
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
She's just lovely girl

682
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
She's delightful

683
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
She always has a whole more done

684
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Her coursework is great

685
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
I said you said

686
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
When is she doing that?

687
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
She seems to be on the computer

688
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
The whole time

689
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
No, she's doing both

690
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
My microphone sounds like ass

691
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
I don't know what happened

692
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
When they did the power

693
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Everything

694
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Yeah, it was a big nasal

695
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Is it nasal?

696
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Hold on

697
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680

You sounded over modulated. All right

Anyway, so that was really nice. Yeah, we were all kind of around like big talk. Yeah, and you know what what I really liked

Yeah, wasn't he involved in it was he involved in some scandal

727
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,560
He was always a football scandal

728
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
Yeah, because it's the drink. I

729
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,880
Yeah, it's the drink. Hey, and the the pubs are not open 24 hours a day here in the UK

730
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,400
So they're expecting a huge binge attack like the I don't think so I don't think that's it's gonna make them that much difference

731
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,440
He's like I don't get it because I don't get drinking at all. No, no, we don't get it at all

732
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,840
But but like we were um we grew up with Amsterdam and the brown cafes and everything and

733
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,400
I remember that of course there were people, you know sitting in a cafe

734
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,200
We call it the brown cafe. It's a pub

735
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,480
The father said need to like go get your father, you know

736
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,200
I kind of go get him from the pub. Yeah, so you always had those people, but

737
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:53,040
I don't know I we never had that problem of I never heard about the word binge drinking in Holland

738
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Did you ever hear about that? No, and especially not the kids

739
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,280
I don't think the kids are interested in Holland no in in in

740
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,520
Maybe split but not no, I think but not even that no

741
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,560
You never hear those things. No, no

742
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Anyway, geez, I need a lot of cheese cheese. They're in the cheese cheese in the pothots

746
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640

750
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,440
I think it was the right out. I was just telling I was some talking to Rob

751
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000

752
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,320
Gossip journalist in Holland. He was friend of ours. Who's a friend of mine? I don't want him writing anything

753
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
No, no, he's not writing at the moment

754
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
There are no good magazines. He wants to work for

755
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
But I was telling him that I enjoyed

756
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,520
English TV so much that we had

757
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,080
I'm a celebrity you get me out of here. Dude now hold on a second

758
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
This is a national

759
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,960
It's a national happening everyone's talking about this and I must say when television is good

760
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
It's really

761
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,640
You know it works because everyone's sitting at home there so that's it's I'm a celebrity

762
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,200
Get me out of here. They throw all these well, you know

763

00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,240
In English I think in Holland

769
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,960

784
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,640
Not depends on what you think it's cute. Okay. He's not my idea of a cute guy. All right, so

785
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,680
But it was fantastic, that it wasn't it really was because first of all this heralthatcher

786
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,680
Because they were you know they record continuously and somewhere in the middle of the night

787

Which which does get broadcast on on sky at least. I don't know have a channel that's all night

788
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
There's a couple tonight. Second night. They were there. They were there. Carol Thatcher

789
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,800
Had to take a pee in the night. So she rolls out of her bed which is like a sleeping bag kind of on the ground

790
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,200
Yeah, and she just squats there where they're humongous boys, but and she doesn't she didn't even

791
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,800
Wipe or dry off anything and she's called back in the bed with the same white butt

792
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,160
And so it's back. That of course is when you talk imagine all over the papers

793
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:16,480
So yesterday and quite a spread it is but she is she is really an iron daughter or something because

794
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Yeah, she is absolutely not the freight. I had the bushwacker trial and the other girl other woman

795
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,920
I don't know her name. What is she like a theater actress or something? She seems like that. Yeah, I don't know. Oh, she is she is

She was an emeraldale. Oh, so guys. She was in yeah another so there's something yeah

797
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,720
So they both had to do the bushwacker trial where you have to eat stuff and it started off with what they started off

798
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
I can't remember what they started off with

799
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:55,520
What was the first thing nasty oh worms? No, it was no worms no that was later on. I can't remember what was first or something like that. Well amongst the delicacies which they ate

800
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,080
We're fish eyes, which okay that that's all right. That was not too bad. What are milder

801
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
Come out of dead bodies

802
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Oh

803
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
I don't know what it's called

804
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,440
maggots maggots maggots handful of maggots one of these humongous caterpillar type things. It was alive

805
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,240
Oh, they had to eat a cockroach cockroach

806
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,920
Yeah, yeah, they had cockroaches and then kangaroo penis

807
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,560
Yes, and kangaroo testicles

808
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,920
That was that I couldn't even test them. They get points for that and then they do and then they

809
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,800
Anyone who eats kangaroo dead stars and every star is a meal because they're starving

810
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,720
There's so hungry that you're kangaroo dead

811
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,760
So two of them were sitting there and I have to say that Carol was now she was great she was so brave

812
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
She just picks shit up and just ate it, man

813
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,320
And you could hear a crunch a cockroach

814
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Like that a couple times she almost puked

815
00:38:53,360 --> 00:39:01,360
Yeah, she gags a little bit but then what what was so funny was and then the other woman had to eat a the kangaroo penis

816
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,800
Just a tip yeah, just a tip and she was very tough and

817
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
So she to a piece of and she said

818
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,200
But when she was done she said can I have a sip of water? I have to get that penis

819
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Taste out of my mouth

820
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,000
It was very funny. No, it's almost said what does it taste like yeah, and she said like ass

821
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,280
And then someone else then say how does she know what else taste like

822
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Yeah, we wonder

823
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,760
What would you be in the the kangaroo penis? No, no way no, I would have eaten that I would have eaten the penis

824
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
Yeah, I can't even eat a blue cheese

825
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,200
Really, no, no, no, but it's fantastic you know how I I don't like that you don't there's the you don't put anything in your mouth

826
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,240
No, because we were listening to the two ladies on the internet

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,880
But I had it a six-day beard

884
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,400
He said it doesn't matter if we're not interested you weren't interested in my beard

885
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,640
Okay, yeah, well, so I

886
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,280
Said can I touch it?

887
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,560
Yeah, and I let you touch it and

888
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,120
Yeah, but then you said

889
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,280
What is this?

890
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Not good right anyway, so something something to suggest I said oh, honey, please can I can I exchange it for

891
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You coming on the show? Yeah, I gave it up for the show. Yes, you did

892
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,120
Yeah, yeah, but I said it's not like I'm giving it up because I can still cash in on it

893
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,640
I can cash on later

894
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,160
But we're talking about these some vintage

895
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,360
Yeah, okay, and

896
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
They are a little bit

897
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,000
Very saturating about this think I was happening with myself

898
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,600
There's a noise gate on it and when you don't talk then it cuts out

899
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
What's happening with my sound down it

900
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,680
So yeah, okay. Oh, you want to hear the magic sent in this thing that I wanted

901
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
Did you hear this yesterday?

902
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,040
I heard it. It was loud enough. Yeah, oh my second

903
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,120
I want to share it. It was funny though. Well funny. It's kind of you know, she's really angry

904
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,240
It's so Adam it's mad listen while you're

905
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,040
busy kissing Apple's ass and licking Steve Jobs balls talking about how wonderful

906
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,840
Enjoy as it is to pay a dollar 99 for a song for a television show you can watch for free

907
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,280
I'm telling you he's talking about lost. I I watch it again this morning

908
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,040
I love it. I love that you can download that for a nine nine. You can't get it here

909
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,120
That was so good. There's still an episode is one. I'm totally hooked. Yeah. That's like a works vision

910
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,160
I've been very upset with Apple actually and I as some of my discussions with you about

911
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:33,760
Apple have been tongue-to-cheek talking about Steve Jobs's high pants others have been less tongue-to-cheek talking about how

912
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,280
Steve Jobs doesn't care about gay people because he doesn't seem to concern himself at all

913
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,240
with putting a gay category gay lesbian kind of let me just say one thing about that

914
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,120
I mean he needs love no, but I mean it's like if you do a game lesbian category

915
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,520
Doing a directory of anything what happens if if all of a sudden you saw an iTunes again

916
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
Lesbian category and you're a transsexual

917
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,200
You know then what do we need we need a transsexual category? Yeah, I think this should have a sexuality

918
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,680
category. I don't know if they have that in iTunes

919
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,640
It's maybe yeah, I mean

920
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,880
Add a gory on the iTunes music store now

921
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,640
My beef with you with Apple today my video website and same films.com

922
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Which was the first

923
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,280
video blog to be some scribble via RSS

924
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:36,720
Has been removed from the iTunes music store with no explanation whatsoever Apple did not answer in queries asking for an explanation

925
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,280
This is ridiculous and

926
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:47,560
Unexceptible completely my video blogs have been very very politically oriented there is some

927
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,520
There is some nudity no, but it is marked explicit as

928
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,880
Instructed and has always been marked explicit

929
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:03,480
So what's the problem and why is there an explicit tag if it doesn't matter and if any right wing Christian crazy

930
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,720
Person who doesn't like freedom of speech complaints about it. They remove it. Is that what happens? Where's the explanation at a minimum?

931
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,720
I should get an explanation

932
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,080
But anyway

933
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:19,880
The moral of this story is that the iTunes music store for podcasts has in my mind become irrelevant

934
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:25,960
Particularly for video blogs first of all. I would encourage anybody who's been screwed over by the music store to send

935
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,000
Adam at curry.com and email so he understands

936
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,240
These are numbers of people that have been removed and and

937
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,880
Basically fucked over by Steve Jobs and his highways did pants

938
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,160
Now secondly, I would like to recommend to

939
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,120
Comprehensive

940
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,080
Video blog directories that do not censor that I enjoy very much number one is me fedia

941
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,560
me fedia that's M E F E E D I A and vlogger

942
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,400
V L O G D I R these are both comprehensive directories that do not censor

943
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:10,440
Political or artistic content. I've had it with the iTunes music store only presenting network garbage

944
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:19,880
That's not what podcasting is about that's not why we started this podcasting movement and the apple can go fuck themselves and Steve Jobs too with your high pants

945
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:27,640
Go bet make your belt one notch tighter mother fucker you're dealing with match wine steam and get used to the fact that we consumers can speak out now

946
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,080
You

947
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,880
Look, oops, look match, match

948
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,560
Calm down. Yeah, really calm first of all calm down

949
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,160
You know

950
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,120
Don't you undone? Don't you see what's happening? Don't you see that this is

951
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,040
That apple is not interested and that if you're all about you know, oh, this is podcasting

952
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,680
This is no restarted for this stop relying on fucking apple

953
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,680
That's what I don't understand. You know, it's like look we're building an entire listener and viewer interface

954
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,920
Over at Pod Show, you know, let's get some of your ideas so we can make it better. You know, don't rely on that

955
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:10,440
Jesus and by the way, this is not people always think that some big evil plan that apple is out to fuck everybody

956
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,400
It's not it's like the shit doesn't breaks doesn't work

957
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,320
It's fucking technology and they've got three people working on it

958
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:25,240
You know to handle all of this stuff or maybe they have a couple more, but not very many and then people people this is same thing with with with Pod Show

959
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,880
They think that we're evil

960
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,880
Yeah, of course because you know, we don't we you know, yeah, we do think yeah, all right, and I do stuff

961
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,560
We don't do the traditional way of all as do a crush release. Let's do a crush tour

962
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,880
You know, we like to build shit get it out there and make it work

963
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,520
I think that that and then I think there's more behind it. Yeah. Oh well, there is of course

964
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,120
I mean

965
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,760
Yeah

966
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,520
So so that you know, so imagine like yelling at Steve John did I hear that yesterday

967
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,520
Yeah, it was through out of the house

968
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,520
Fuck you

969
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:09,480
But it's not so unnecessary. You know, it's so unnecessary. Fuck him. It doesn't matter

970
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,880
It's like everyone is like you know without iTunes podcasting won't exist all of a sudden

971
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,960
You know as if if you if you wanted to find a podcast about a particular topic. What would you do

972
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,320
When you just go to Google and say find podcast about

973
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,240
What would you want to hear a podcast about me? Yeah

974
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,440
Oh everything actually it's just people talking about everything

975
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,680
Okay, yeah, but be anything right so you're dealing give a shit of it's a particular topic

976
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,000
No, so maybe you'd say I want to

977
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,280
I always want to learn something right, but there's something that I don't know so

978
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,920
So what would you do if you wanted to go find a podcast where would you go?

979
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,000
Why would I go? Yeah, would you come ask me? Yeah, yeah, that's exactly how it works. That's the whole point

980
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,920
I'll ask and I'd say try it. Yeah, you're a department fan. Thank you, baby. Yeah, yeah, of course

981
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,200
Of course, of course that's how it works and not like oh let me go to a fucking director. Yeah

982
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah, you know, it's like oh, I don't I don't believe that's not the way I don't do that when you want to find what's on TV

983
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,400
Well, good show. How do you do that? You ask me yeah, exactly see

984
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,560

988
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,760

Because we bikes in Belgium and in Holland and

Which is not possible here because it's too too steep into

998
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,800
How it's it's possible?

999
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,000
