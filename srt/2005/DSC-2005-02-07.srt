Daily source code February 7th 2005 transmitters we don't need no

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,160
Stinking transmitters autistic it's Adam Curry. Hey everybody thank God it's a

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:21,000
Monday. It's a daily source code coming to you from what was actually a very

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,120
cloudy and misty and overcast day here in Guilford and Surrey in

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,040
the Kingdom of Curry Cottage actually it's a nice day so the birds are

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,640
out they're singing and it's time for your source code for the 7th of February

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:41,920
2005. So as long as it was yesterday I'm gonna cut it just a little bit

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,800
shorter today do it well I'm gonna try and keep it at the at the 40

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,760
minute mark as you used to maybe just a little bit shorter because we're

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,880
gonna talk for a little while with a special guest on the show about a topic

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,360
that came up yesterday on the source code that is getting a lot of comments

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:05,720
of getting a lot of email particularly about the EU the European Union and so

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,160
apparently I'm not that well informed and maybe you aren't either but I

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,360
think it's interesting stuff we should talk about.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,760
But first of course some pod save music although I'm not quite sure well this

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,120
yeah I think this is pretty pod safe it's it was sent to me in reference to

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,080
the Michael Jackson comments yesterday actually I did see that Haraldo interview

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,840
and I was not disappointed Haraldo indeed thinks Michael Jackson is being

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,400
framed and the problem with that interview is that Michael is so nice and so

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,840
clean cut you just wanted to say fuck you motherfucker you know that would

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,760
if you just said that you know then I would feel much better it's so clean but

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,800
believe me this guy is you know he was he's been raised to be very polite very

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,320
nice and I think he's probably getting getting jerked around don't take that

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,560
too literally please so anyway here's a tune sure

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,560
do you want to buy a backwards and a sec when she's having it even if he is

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:33,240
bad we might fear we'd blame we'd give him fame and we could make him

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,680
to subpeer things people here they can't help it it just goes along with being

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:49,840
a star we need a star to be a little star only to remind us how normal we are

29
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:59,200
when smear it we're out to it it's year when the clear to live it first

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:08,800
alive the hair of the world mean things people wear

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,780
so i feel she's your woman

32
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,300
we'll come back with Michael Jackson because I never had a chance to be in the

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,860
Neither would you, if parents had you up, they're singing in dance and when you

34
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,280
younger than the drum and from handson, you probably turned out like Marilyn

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,060
Manson, friends, and I'm stage without any pants on, even if the

36
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:56,540
night's strange, they're here, we believe everything we hear, I've brought

37
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,580
about rich and kids just keep in mind, before you sneer, we'll give them the

38
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:11,540
Korean-based people a weird, can't help it, it just controls a lot of things to our

39
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:18,660
friends, people who are weird, they can't help it, it just controls a lot of things to our

40
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,340
neighbors, people who are weird, it's like the mean, the president, the start of hitting you

41
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:32,340
the matter, they're bunching around, they're weird, it's like the mean, the president, the start of hitting you

42
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,500
the way they're out of your mind, the way they're out of your mind, the way they're

43
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:47,100
weird, it's like the mean, the people who are weird, they're weird, it's like the

44
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,720
girls who are weird, they're weird, there you go, the same as people who are weird,

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
they're just trying to be a weird, you know what, otherwise they wouldn't be

46
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,200
interested to look at, to listen to, that's why we like famous people, they become famous

47
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,600
because they're different weird, artistic, or whatever, yeah, Dr. Demento from his basement

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,600
tapes, volume 12, famous people is the title of that, and you know what February is, don't you?

49
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,560
Shame on you if you don't

50
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm a little bit worried about you, yeah, I'm PW Fenton here, as you well know, here in the

51
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,600
United States we set aside the month of February is black history month, last weekend I spent

52
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,920
a day at a street festival honoring Zora Neal Hurston in Eatonville, Florida, the oldest

53
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,960
incorporated black city in the United States, and that inspired me to turn this week's

54
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,920
digital flat some into my black history month edition, it's a little different, but that's

55
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:24,600
what I try to make every show, I hope you can check it out, yeah, I am so into this podcast

56
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,240
digital flat some, PW Fenton has a great job, he's been doing a lot of blue stuff recently

57
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,400
and just a whole vibe, there's something about this podcast that, you know, I keep thinking

58
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,280
this has got to be on, it's like some repurpose show that's already on radio, but no,

59
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,680
this is a podcast, and as you just heard, the digital flat some podcast is a highlighting black

60
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,840
history month and I'm looking forward to it, because it's going to be some really, really cool podcast.

61
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,200
Again, we've got a special guest coming up who I'm going to Skype in, but first it's time for

62
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,000
the little segment we do every single day.

63
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:20,520
Hi Adam, I'm Paulette here again with another hit test, it's number six already and I'll try

64
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,920
to make one every day for you, like I told you, I don't know for sure if that is possible,

65
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,200
but I'll do my best, let me tell you that opening a Gmail account was really a great move

66
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:39,800
because now I'm also getting lots of feedback and I really enjoy that, lots of people telling me

67
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,600
it's a great test and they're having lots of fun playing in with you, that's also one of the

68
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,160
biggest problems for me, because many people have been asking me when I will be starting my own podcast,

69
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,480
well there are two things I really like about this thing, the first thing is putting it together,

70
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,200
editing and recording it, and the second thing is hearing you taking the test,

71
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,680
hearing me suck, if I make it into its own podcast, I won't be hearing you take the test,

72
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,600
so hold it right there, yeah, it's cool, you can make a podcast, it could be the same thing,

73
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,160
you know, whatever you want, that's the cool thing, I don't think one has to exclude the other,

74
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,240
it would be shame, so I'm thinking about what to do about it, if you have some tips or suggestions

75
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,960
please let me know, and if there are other people that have suggestions please send them to hittest at

76
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:41,720
gmail.com, any feedback is welcome, hittest at gmail.com, by the way the sounds you're hearing right now,

77
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:49,800
that's the trick that was used, that you played actually in 1991, I think, it's from the second

78
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,840
air check, I played a few days ago, and you're right, it's not a great song, it's not a great

79
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,120
production, but the rhythm track is awesome, so I turn it into a filler, all righty, it's dry,

80
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,960
let's go, I think it's time for the test, right? I'm just a play, are you ready, this is number one,

81
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,440
all right, oh yeah, of course, Robbie Neville, say la b, ever bobbing now,

82
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:31,160
I love this song, number two, yeah, I certainly recognize it, is this a,

83
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,880
it sounds like a pet child boy's production,

84
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,800
and pet child boy is very good, he really was in the news, stuck with you, man, I must have played this song

85
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:58,600
a million times, and at least 10 different radio stations, okay, two out of three, not bad for a

86
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,560
Monday morning, what do you say? The answers, and here are the answers, this is number one,

87
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,600
that was Robbie Neville, right? Not a difficult, I think, it's Robbie Neville, with sale of

88
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
the y'all American pronunciation of sale of the show on the, yeah, I'm out of that,

89
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,640
great song, you know, this Robbie Neville actually,

90
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:32,760
Patricia recorded a song called Danger, which I'll play for you one of these days, which he wrote,

91
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
it's great, he's a great song, right?

92
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,440
Well Adam, I sincerely hope you had the second one, right? Okay, because I, I hate to find out tomorrow

93
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,000
that today the source code has been cancelled, due to the tragic death of the host,

94
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,120
can you buy his wife? Oh shit, this is an excursion for you, but I buy yourself,

95
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:22,200
Saturday night, I can't. Oh man, oh man, if Patricia finds out, she's gonna kill me, that's right, I knew I

96
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
recognized it.

97
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
That's all.

98
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,120
Of course, I was 12 when this was released, right?

99
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:54,040
There did not, I'd must have been 1970, there he goes, I feel like that.

100
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,120
Oh, well, I hope you're still around tomorrow, I might not be, this is number three.

101
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,920
Yeah, here we go. That is you, we lose, and the new stuff, and stuck with you.

102
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Oh man, I can't believe unless the, you're good,

103
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,880
but I've been down that rock, you alone, we're here, we have the same a chance.

104
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,440
Yes, it's true. Yes, it's true. I don't happen to be stuck with you.

105
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,280
Yes, it's true. Yes, it's true. But I'm so happy to be stuck with you.

106
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:54,280
You will lose in the news, and stuck with you. Oh man, I'm also very happy to be stuck with you on the daily source code.

107
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:03,080
I don't know if I will be starting podcasts of my own. Please keep sending feedback to

Adam's Web Law. Well, Adam, see you next time for the next edition of the hittest. Bye bye.

113
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:47,160
Oh, yeah, man, I'm going to be in so much trouble when Patricia finds out that I messed that up.

114
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,800
Oh my goodness. And you know Saturday night, I literally was like 12 or 13 when that song was released.

115
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,040
You know, I hope she gives me a little bit of leeway. That was trick, man. You tricked me.

116
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,880
I've played some 80 stuff that I really, oh, but it did sound like the Pet Shop Boys,

117
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,760
which I guess is a compliment for the production values. That was when she was disco queen,

118
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,240
everybody. Oh, man. It's time to get Patricia back on the show.

119
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,640
Alrighty, okay. So indeed, hopefully there will be a source code tomorrow after this snafu.

120
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,640
Time now to talk about the European Union. Yesterday, I had a long talk with you about my

121
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,240
feelings about the EU and boy, to that sparks some interesting conversation in the comments on

122
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,240
both curie dot com and on daily source code dot com. We had a podcast Paul actually who was

123
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,600
a student of the EU and the history has really been feeding some fantastic information. I've also

124
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:46,360
received privately many, many emails talking about the history of the EU and it's like it's unbelievable

125
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,800
that we're at the on the brink of signing a constitution, bringing all these as they call them

126
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,000
member states. You know, they don't call member countries. Members states bring them together into

127
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,720
into one union that shares not just money, but laws as well. And I think there's a lot of confusion.

128
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,560
And I'm certainly not well informed. I thought I was, but when I read through all these emails

129
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,120
and all the information I've been receiving. I've been finding it's just very confusing. Maybe

130
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,760
that's something that we can work on. And I received an email this morning. It's about 430

131
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,240
in the afternoon. Actually, I'm doing this on Monday from Raymond Port. And if you think that

132
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,760
name rings a bell, it does because way back when I just started doing the source code. Now,

133
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,440
I was doing one in Holland driving in studio A8 from Holland down to Belgium. You remember there was

134
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,280
a guy holding an iPod up and honking the horn and traffic at me saying, I'm listening to the

135
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,280
source code and was early on. And that was Raymond. And Raymond sent me a long email about

136
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,720
the European Union. And he certainly is well much more versed than I am. So I thought it would be

137
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,640
a perfect opportunity to see if we can get the old Skype system working and have a little chat

138
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,880
with him. So I'm calling him now. I think he's at work. So let's see if we can get Raymond in here.

139
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Let me crank this up a little bit. Make it a little bit louder.

140
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:22,760
Hello, Raymond. Hello. You're on the source code. Can you hear me? Raymond? Hello? Well, it's not the

141
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,840
first time. Yeah. Well, yeah, I know. I know it's not the first time. I don't know. We know it's not

142
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:37,240
the first time. That's for sure. Yeah, that's true. So how are you? Yeah, I'm doing pretty great actually.

143
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,480
A lot of things on my mind about the working working very hard. And are you at the office right

144
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,760
now Raymond? Am I calling you at work? Yeah, you're calling me at the work. So I will not let my

145
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,800
boss live here. It is. Okay. Well, I really appreciate you taking it. Well, again, one hour break at a

146
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,600
day. So it's pretty okay. Okay. So this is this is your break then clearly. Yeah, this is my 15 minutes break.

147
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,680
Excellent. Well, I appreciate it. On behalf of the source code listeners, we really appreciate

148
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,520
you hopping on the the Skype. And by the way, kind of just comment on your picture on Skype,

149
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,280
it is very becoming. It's just beautiful. That hell. Hell is on your head, man. What is that?

150
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:24,280
Yeah, it's a punch ball pad. Oh, that's bad. It was taken in Universal Studios last year.

151
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,480
So Raymond, you were, I was just explaining to the listeners that you were one of the people who sent

152
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,920
me a very eloquent email about the European Union. And maybe you could just reiterate a bit

153
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,760
because you heard my podcast yesterday, obviously. And you had some things to say about the history

154
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,400
where it's coming from. And just what the hell is going on? What is happening in Europe? Are we

155
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,960
trying to create the United States of Europe? Yeah, it's well, it seems like it. Actually, I was

156
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,720
listening to the source code this morning in the car, of course. Of course. And yeah, the thing

157
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,480
you said about Europe at this moment, I think it's really true. People at least in an Netherlands,

158
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,520
they don't, they don't really seem to care if there are elections or anything. Not many people are

159
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,120
voting. And we don't know. We don't know what's going on. On the other end, I cannot really say too many

160
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,440
negative things about Europe because actually European Commission is a customer of mine.

161
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,800
Well, that sucks. Well, but let me understand something here. Because what,

162
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,480
okay, so this is actually interesting. People don't know a lot about the European Union,

163
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,880
which I think is worse than agreeing or disagree. And if you don't know what's going on, that's horrible.

164
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,840
What is there actually is power shifting from the individual countries to Brussels and to

165
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,640
Strasbourg? Will laws be made there that will apply to all of the member states?

166
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:02,680
Actually, yeah, that is what is happening. And not many people know of it. And it goes pretty far.

167
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:10,200
I don't know the insight that I've heard. It goes pretty far. And it could be threatening as well.

168
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:18,520
On the other end, each country is trying to, well, let's say, save its own culture.

169
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:27,720
Right. So, yeah, it's just very delicate and complex thing, obviously, because every country

170
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,080
and borders France, there is volume. We all know how France is with its own culture.

171
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,600
Yeah, they're very protective of it. Difficulties.

172
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,800
Yeah, you can say that. If you don't speak French, you have a big problem.

173
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,920
Well, so this is one of the reasons, well, that everything is bilingual.

174
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,480
Well, isn't it even so that the European, that the Parliament,

175
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,000
that they, which is, I guess it's all supposed to be in Brussels, but the French,

176
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,280
and this is the way I've heard it. The French complain so much that they set up this other

177
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,440
center in Strasbourg, and now the entire European government, if we can call it that,

178
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,600
literally goes from Strasbourg back and forth to Brussels to make everybody happy, is that what's happening?

179
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,720
What could very well be, actually, I'm not 100% sure, whether it kind of strange that there are two centers.

180
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,800
And people really day, one half of the week there in Strasbourg and the other half there in Brussels.

181
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,040
Even going on commute every day. It's just crazy.

182
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,680
And then they also have to go back to their own country. So they often have to spend that time there,

183
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,880
as well, I presume, right?

184
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,520
Yeah, and it's all paid by the man.

185
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,560
No, no, that would be you and I, dude, we are the man in that case. We're paying for it.

186
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:52,360
Oh, I don't mean it's all our money. But it was a kind of fun, what you said, and the source,

187
00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:00,600
I guess, that actually it's going back on control now. Europe is all about control and

188
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,280
new laws are being done. The history of Europe, and that's something that's not really much

189
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:15,960
or many people know, started off with control. The very basic reason for building one big

190
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:24,840
Europe was actually the wish for some countries to have no more war in Europe.

191
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:32,280
Okay. Obviously, the middle ages and the 80th century, even Napoleon and the first world war,

192
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:39,400
which started with Germany and France and the second world war again in Europe, many countries

193
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,280
had to be feeling no more war in Europe and how can we prevent that while we can prevent that by

194
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:53,720
introducing the euro. And then everything was bright and clear. Yeah, and then it was all

195
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,200
sat and we were all happy. No, but we're not happy. I mean, it just, it makes no sense.

196
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,400
I mean, the fact that people don't know what the hell is going on, that tells me enough.

197
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,720
I mean, I'm American. So the Constitution of the United States is the document that the entire

198
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,040
country and its government, everything was built around. It's a document that every American

199
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,920
oops, I think I just lost Raymond there. Hold on, let me see if I can get him back.

200
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,680
You all continue on my, um, on my rant there. Let me just see if I can get Raymond back. I hate it

201
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,760
when Skype does that. That's so unfair in the middle of me talking. You know, cut him off. Okay,

202
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,960
but shoot. Don't tell me this is not going to work. Come on, Raymond, come back to me.

203
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:50,760
Hmm. Maybe we'll have to play a song, uh, failed unknown error. Yeah. All righty. We love that.

204
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,440
Let's try it one more time here. Hold on. Maybe that's a connectivity thing on his end. Okay.

205
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,400
Meanwhile, we're about 22 minutes into your daily source code for Monday, February 7, 2005.

206
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,920
Now it says, user not on law. I'll tell you what, we're going to play a little song. See, we can pick

207
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,920
Raymond up, uh, in a, in a minute or two. This is, uh, for my buddy, Sid, Sid happens. He said,

208
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,520
me this wonderful mashup. See if you can recognize it.

209
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,880
It's a funny thing for me to try it. It's playing. I don't feel any more pride. I don't want to blame.

210
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,200
There's no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

212
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,880
