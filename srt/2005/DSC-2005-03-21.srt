00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
This is the Daily Source Code for March 21st, 2005.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But it's still the 21st summer at the Universe, right?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's the Daily Source Code for Monday, everybody.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Man, I gotta tell you, I'm completely wrecked from today's activities, which, too.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Actually, the first daughter of the day was kind of nice.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It was outside for most of the day, but after about three o'clock,

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've been on Skype nonstop.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm telling you, you can build an entire business with Skype.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's actually pretty outrageous.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, family is asleep right now, and I'm up here.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Excuse me.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In the office, slash studio, because, well, I gotta do a show every day.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's kind of my commitment.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So, I apologize upfront.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If the energy is just a little bit low, but I just can't punch out what I normally do.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Not only because I want to sleep, but I'm just totally, completely wrecked.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But I got a great show.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Can you tell I've been smoking some cigars?

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Man, it's been an interesting weekend, too.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
To start off with, Sunday night was the big good Charlotte show.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
As you know, that's Christina's favorite, favorite band.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They were playing at Brickston Academy.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, that's to the south of...

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's actually...

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I guess it's south of the West London.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not a very nice neighborhood. I'll tell you that.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, boy.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I haven't actually talked about this during the week,

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but Christina, of course, had been looking forward to this for quite a while.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But, well, you know, you know how when kids are basically,

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
they've got a big mouth and they're, you know,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
mouthing off at mom and even a dad and doing things that shouldn't do

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and forgetting things they should do and you get into that mode where you say,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
like, hey, look, you know, if you don't straighten up, it'll be no good Charlotte.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, at a certain point, you've got to make good on the threat.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And it's the most horrible, hurtful things I've ever had to do.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And, of course, it hurt me more than it hurt her, but it came down to where we said,

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry, you can't go.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So, that totally sucks.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I really was bad, especially because she had her friend coming over

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to stay with her and that when it go to the concert together,

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I was going to take him.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And, of course, her friend had already made the plans and so she, you know,

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
basically, she showed up, couldn't do anything about that.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And it was not really fair to punish her, so I wound up taking her friend to the concert.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, it was just a major league, painful parenting moment, let me tell you.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But I think it really worked out for the good, you know, to really,

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
sometimes you've got to go all the way through, you know, the threat is just not enough.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You've got to actually do it.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And it certainly is made a difference in a real big attitude adjustment,

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
but that sucks to have to do that.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I really did not enjoy that at all.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Particularly because my buddy James had set up passes for the after show party.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It was just sucks.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, so that was kind of, you know, what we witnessed from Thursday Friday Saturday.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And so that's why there was no PPP podcast, yes, they either.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And I see today, I got up, well, of course, a ticker student at the school.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She's just, she's a wonderful child now.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It totally worked.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, no matter how much it hurt.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And after that, you know, I did my email stuff and did my aggregator scans.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's do a couple podcasts.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And then I went off to purchase a aviation map of the UK,

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
because I'm starting to get really starting to do some training.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wind commander William and I will be flying on a Wednesday.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And he'll be training me in the assessment of 182 RG,

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
which stands for retractable gear.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And we're really going to hit it hard.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And if, if it all possible, whether permitting and, well, et cetera, et cetera,

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
we'll actually fly home or fly here in, in the assessment.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And then he'll fly it back.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So I'm really looking forward to that all a part of the training.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But I talked about for, um, for my fixed wing, uh, PPL,

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
private pilot's license.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Excuse me.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Ah, I wasn't going to behind the desk.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know what it is.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You know, if I'm sitting, uh, in back of the big green easy chair,

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
then I don't get all this gas.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't burp whenever I'm leaning forward into the microphone.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You by the way, I've been on the computer so long today.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can actually hear the fan pumping away.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Listen, I'll see here a little bit of that.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I have no patience right now to figure out where the hum is coming from.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But, uh, everything's been, uh, been rolling nonstop.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
As soon as we've been, uh, oh, man, talking a whole bunch of people, uh,

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
really, uh, getting pretty exciting.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No damn announcements today.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm too tired to do anything.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But, uh, we're getting pretty close to be able to talk about some, uh,

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
some of the cool stuff that's going on with, uh, with pod show and with, uh,

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
with Boku and podcasting in general.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Now, if, um, I got a lot of great comments on the, uh,

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
sound scene tour from Friday, um, the trip to the BBC.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you all very much.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm glad you liked it.

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I thought it was, it was so long.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I had to, uh, head it down four and almost four and a half hours

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
down to, but I tried to get it, you know, to less than an hour,

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
but wasn't able to do less than like an hour and 20.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Um, and there was one, uh, particular piece from, uh,

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
uh, from that show that I only played a very little bit of that,

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it's a, it's a mashup, um, that came from, uh,

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
digitalinterference.org.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I really wanted to play it because there was so much work

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
that went into it and it really didn't, uh, get its props, uh,

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
being played through the speaker, being picked up on my,

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
on my wireless microphone, uh, while I was, uh,

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
uh, why played it for the, uh, for the BBC piece.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's, um, it's all about the TSA and, uh,

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
my issues with airport security, which I'll be, um,

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
witnessing again pretty soon as we're going on vacation, uh,

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
to Florida in just, uh, well, uh, what is it, uh,

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
less than a week now, uh, east of vacation, of course,

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and looking forward to some nice fun in the sun,

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but I did want to play this one.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's the drop system versus Adam Curry.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He went in two, three, two, three, four, five.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is the individual interference.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Take that one.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Take that one.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Take that one.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Give us all the answers.

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Homeland security.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's not protecting us.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's not making your flight any safe for you.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's really slowing everybody down.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's not protecting us.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not making your flight any safe for you.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's really slowing everybody down.

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The citizens of the United States,

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the Americans who are putting up with Homeland security.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Homeland security.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Homeland security.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Homeland security.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Homeland security.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The robotic voice is talking,

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
it'll all be really convinced that we're safe,

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and you can sniff,

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and then nothing can explode,

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
or dangerous, or pointy, or whatever,

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and look inside of you,

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to be in danger, brain.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And we're soaked into the wounded process,

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
we pay for the flying attach...

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
NASA's...

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
One checkpoint.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Another checkpoint.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Another checkpoint.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Another checkpoint.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Another checkpoint.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Another checkpoint.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:12,800
We're gonna do this for safety and against terrorism.

154
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Terrorism.

155
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Terrorism.

156
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Terrorism.

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Terrorism.

158
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Terrorism.

159
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Terrorism.

160
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,640
That there my friends is the drop system versus Adam Curry in airport security.

161
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,640
You can find more drop system tracks at www.thedropsystem.com.

162
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,120
I don't have much more to say today other than that.

163
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,200
I like that mix a lot better than the other mix that was featured on the daily source

164
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
code.

165
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,960
I like this one very, very much.

166
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Thank you very much.

167
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,160
Digitalinterfearance.org and actually I've got a whole bunch of promos and stuff lined up

168
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
for today.

169
00:09:51,160 --> 00:10:00,320
And a lot of promos have also since my Gmail account started to fill up on MP3 feedback.

170
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,280
So whatever is ordered to do now is just send me a link to the MP3 file and a lot of people

171
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,680
am doing that and I really appreciate it.

172
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,160
So I've got some promos lined up and by the way and all the conversations and stuff

173
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,920
that we've been doing and working on some investments in podcasting talent.

174
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,920
That's not just for people who make podcasts by the way.

175
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,800
Also for there's lots of opportunity for developers and for producers.

176
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,680
There's just a minute so much.

177
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,360
I think we finally got into the point where it's about the content.

178
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,200
I remember it's about 10 years ago to the day almost.

179
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,680
We were saying content is king and this is where it's going to go.

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,640
And finally I think we've gotten there where it's not just about the podcast showing up

181
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,920
on your iPod or MP3 player.

182
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,280
It's actually about the show.

183
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,600
People are totally day in these shows and I think that's what's really got me jazzed

184
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,480
about all the stuff that's going on.

185
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,720
Also I wanted to mention that the tests that I've been doing with basically selling stuff

186
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,840
talking about stuff in the podcast or stuff that we've already talked about and then putting

187
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,960
an Amazon link on in the show notes or on my weblog at curie.com.

188
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:19,160
Once I started doing that, which I think was, let me see, how long have I had the

189
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,720
Sensei O'Coffee machine up?

190
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,840
A couple of weeks, six weeks, maybe something like that.

191
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,200
I checked today and I have sold over $4,000 worth of goods.

192
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,520
Of course that's not, I mean, I just get a percentage of that but my goodness, over $4,000

193
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
worth.

194
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,080
This is amazing.

195
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,760
And I was supposed to cue, let me try that again, $4,000 worth.

196
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:54,400
That's just amazing.

197
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,680
Hi, I'm Georgia and the group you're hearing in the background is 3K now.

198
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,760
One of the great Caribbean artists, as you can experience, if you tune into a podcast,

199
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Caribbean Free Radio.

200
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,520
You'll also hear me, and they're the more interesting voices and vibes from the Caribbean region,

201
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,640
plus lots of birds, frogs, and any other creature that happens to form part of the backdrop

202
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,680
in this fascinating crossroads where we live, work and play.

203
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,840
Caribbean Free Radio, the podcast.

204
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,680
Check us out at www.caribbeanfreeradio.com.

205
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,520
That's actually, definitely one of my favorite podcasts, the Caribbean.

206
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,760
I was always Caribbean, but I guess it's Caribbean Free Radio, so you're far.

207
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,160
It's short, it's like 15, 20 minutes, it's always got some great music in there, and

208
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,000
if you ever been to the Caribbean, I'm a big Jamaica fan of, oh man, I think I've been

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,120
to Jamaica 15 times.

210
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
I love it there.

211
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,040
It's actually, we should go back again, oh man, it's just such a pain and

212
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,240
ass pain in the ass to actually get there, it's no direct flight.

213
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,560
I think actually, but I just think corrected, there was the used to be no direct flight.

214
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,680
There is from London, I guess, maybe, hey, that's something we could look into.

215
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,080
Need to go back to Jamaica, desperately.

216
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,840
Funny, I was a Patricia's been talking about getting a tattoo, and not just any

217
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:20,520
old tattoo or for any reason, as a part of her heart medicine, instead of taking pills,

218
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,480
she has kind of like a sticker that she puts on her arm every day, and it dispenses

219
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,400
like this three milligrams or whatever of this blood thinner and heart healthy stuff into

220
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
her bloodstream.

221
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,920
It kind of does that gradually throughout the day, and what she wants to do is, it's

222
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,080
kind of like a little oval sticker, and she hates the whole fact that she has to have

223
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,560
it, and she's bummed out about it, so she wants to do some kind of really cool tattoo

224
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,920
that incorporates the sticker, so to be around the sticker, I have no idea what she's

225
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
going to come up with, but I guess she's working on something.

226
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,800
So there's been a lot of discussion about tattoos in the Curry Cottage.

227
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,560
Of course, Christina, I immediately jumped into, oh yeah, I want to tattoo as well, I don't

228
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,280
think, oh man, I've never had any drive for anything like that, but now that I think

229
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,480
about it, maybe a nice little marijuana leaf on the shoulder there, maybe it's just

230
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
experienced.

231
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,680
Download the new edition of the digital experience podcast, Available Now, only at

232
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,680
the lab.teethville.com.

233
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,920
That was like quick to the point.

234
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,920
So tomorrow, I will be doing a podcast, not quite sure what time that one will be up.

235
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,000
In fact, I'm even going to try and do a podcast with Ken Clark doing MTV Chronicles.

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
That may be what we'll be doing tomorrow.

237
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm traveling to, I got to go visit some lawyers basically tomorrow, so real fun day, that's

238
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,200
why I'm staying overnight, strap on some practice with the wing commander right after that.

239
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,640
So look forward to hopefully MTV Chronicles.

240
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,760
Ken has been actually, he pulled out some of the old memos.

241
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,280
He's such a hamster man, he's got the infamous Michael Jackson King of Pop memo.

242
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,320
I think I've told that story before, I won't spoil it if you haven't, because it's

243
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,240
absolutely excellent.

244
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,280
And there's a couple more in there, I think, that'll, that'll ticker your fancy.

245
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,880
Again, today's pretty much a promo podcast, and it's got to kind of keep it down and

246
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
can't be yelling throughout the cottage, because, you know, it's not quite the castle anymore.

247
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,800
You know, I don't have that bar area that I can just yell all night, no one hears me.

248
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,720
So let's check out what we got here.

249
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,920
Hi Adam and daily source code listeners, I'm Anna, and I'm Jason from the Delta Park Project.

250
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,680
We don't know anything about sports, but we went to a Myrlic hockey game here in Portland.

251
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,120
I made a sound seeing tour of it.

252
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
Adam, you would have liked it.

253
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,760
The soundtrack to the game was pretty much a CDC in Scorpions.

254
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,720
Here's a clip.

255
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Here comes our first fight.

256
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Oh, yeah.

257
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
That breath I'm breaking them up.

258
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
Oh, is that blood?

259
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,760
Yeah, there's blood.

260
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,880
That's really loud in here, and there's this old lady over to our right, and she's got

261
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,840
like these industrial strength, sound protection, and then she's reading a book.

262
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,280
Oh, they're making a ranting run!

263
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Yeah!

264
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,920
Woo!

265
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Half of the door, half of the door!

266
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,520
Oh, the credit goes, wow!

267
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,120
If you want to check out the full show, head over to Adam's sound scene director.

268
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,320
Just go to our site, DeltaParkProject.com, where you can also find our most recent show where

269
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,480
we visit Portland's only nude beach and go looking for Kirk Cameron's career.

270
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Oh, Kirk Cameron's a nice guy.

271
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't be so mean.

272
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,200
I just did some sound seeing at the good Charlotte concert last night.

273
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,600
And I actually recorded it on my phone.

274
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,480
I was just wondering, maybe I couldn't have Bluetooth this over right now.

275
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,160
Let me see if this is, okay, yeah, that's the one, hold on a second.

276
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,800
Let me see if I could, oh, this would be kind of cool.

277
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,400
Let me see if I can send it now.

278
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,160
Here we go, send it via Bluetooth.

279
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,600
So I just recorded on the phone's internal recording device that you can also

280
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
record phone calls with.

281
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,560
So now what I've done, I'm actually trying to send this file,

282
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,800
straight from the phone over to my laptop, which is what I'm using for playback.

283
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,840
There it goes, it's connected, oh, this is so cool.

284
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,440
Oh, man, okay, so it's, how much longer does it have to go?

285
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,720
It's, uh, what is this, uh, 275 kilobytes.

286
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
Oops, I got to kind of keep the phone near the computer.

287
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,160
Because these damn G4 laptops are so much titanium and metal or whatever the hell it is.

288
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,920
Oh, it's like that, uh, it doesn't really receive, uh, Bluetooth very well.

289
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,160
Okay, cool, now this is going to rock.

290
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,400
So it's received it.

291
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,040
Now I can just click it, click on the little, uh, search thing there.

292
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,400
It should bring up the file in a finder window.

293
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,440
Yep, did that and I can open it and it should open it up in a quick time and I should be able to

294
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:22,560
Okay, um, uh, right outside the, uh, uh, kind of, right outside of the auditorium,

295
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,200
and it sounds like the name is about to come on names.

296
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,160
It's like some kind of new opening of the cast, uh, and selling it like this out.

297
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,200
I get it like three seconds before, then I'm starting to raise up and start to bring up.

298
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,760
Oh, there you go.

299
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,280
Stand, aye.

300
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,680
I'll have to go in in a few minutes and go check it out.

301
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,640
That's right, my for brick and the cattle is good sharp.

302
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,400
Obviously.

303
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:23,760
So clearly not edited down. Let me see if on the kick out.

304
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,720
Just fast for a little quick.

305
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,520
There you go.

306
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
Okay, so let's establish that that sound really sucks.

307
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,520
Oh, by the way, um, people are asking me about the sound that I, um, that I actually was able to create with the, um,

308
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,800
with the I river for the sound seeing tour of, I mean, a lot of the, of the beauty of that sound is because,

309
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,960
I'm using this wireless microphone set. Now I know that, you know, we've discussed this before and people

310
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,680
keep asking me what kind of microphone you're using. I'm using a electro LECTRO or Lima echo Charlie

311
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:09,360
Tango Romeo Oscar. Uh, it's a wireless transmitter and receiver. And I think what, that it's all

312
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,040
really in the, in the, in the, in the preamp that's in those, uh, in those two boxes. I'm not sure if

313
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,160
it's on the receiving sender, a side or the on the, on the transmitting side. But that's really where

314
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
all that great sound comes from, you know, it's just, you know, kind of goes to show that,

315
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,600
you know, it's, you still need some kind of equipment. If you really want to get the sound out of the,

316
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,400
I mean, you can't compare it to the internal mic, it probably can't compare it to a microphone.

317
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,920
You just plug into the I river. Um, it's, uh, I mean, that's just really, really good sound. And I,

318
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm curious to know, uh, I think, um, actually Madge Weinstein uses some kind of microphone on the

319
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:53,520
I river, which is also a love microphone. Maybe, uh, she can post, uh, the, the details of what she's

320
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,640
using because that's, I mean, it's really, uh, that sounds pretty good too. And what I like about the

321
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,600
I river, which we've talked about is that you can actually choose between a line in or a microphone in.

322
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,800
So it does have some form of preamp in there. Um, and, you know, so it's, it's kind of working on

323
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,440
the, on the right combination. So if anyone else has any experience, let me know because I definitely

324
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,360
want to try and, uh, and codify some of these setups, what, uh, what works best for people.

325
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,800
Um, you might have seen or heard about the, uh, announcement about Nomdex 5.0. I'll be, uh, doing, uh,

326
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,680
I don't know if it's the keynote or one of the keynote's really excited about that. I remember when,

327
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,200
uh, we were in Guilford and Patricia and I were, I think was that, was that Nomdex was that web

328
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,760
2.0. I think it was Nomdex, wasn't it? Um, pretty sure it was. I think that's when we were in the hotel

329
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,640
and, uh, we were listening, uh, via the Wi-Fi. Um, Chris Perilla puts that show on. I'm, uh, pretty excited

330
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,160
about going out there. I mean, it's way out on, uh, it's in Seattle, basically, but, uh, and it's, uh,

331
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,960
I think it's sort of the July 25th or something like that. Let me just check for a second here for

332
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:19,040
your hold on. Might as well do that while we're at it. Okay. Uh, it's Nomdex.com. GNOMEDEX. It is, uh, June,

333
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:26,240
not July of course. June 23rd through the 25th, 2005, which is great because, um, on my way back,

334
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,240
I'll go through Portland and that's where I'll actually do my, uh, test for, uh, for my ticket for my,

335
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,280
for my fixed way. Trying to combine things, you're on a daily source code, boss. Hey,

336
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,800
Adam, it's the E-Man from Podheads Radio. Just dropping into let you know what's going on

337
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,240
with the Podheads. This week, we completed show number six of our weekly series. And with this show,

338
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,640
each of the Podheads has had an opportunity to host their own little corner of our world.

339
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,960
What do we do on Podheads Radio? Well, we talk about radio. If you were going to pick a

340
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,360
commercial radio station anywhere, that was podcast worthy. I think it would be these guys because

341
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,840
I hear people doing podcasts. I hear what they're talking about and, and that is,

342
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,400
essentially what real radio is about.

343
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,600
Oh, and old stuff was hot. And no one better exemplified the movement. That raw angry funk.

344
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,520
Slice still.

345
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,720
We even plug a little fun at ourselves and the world. This whole steroid thing in baseball is

346
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,040
the inspiration behind this show. You know, I figure if it helps a baseball player hit a ball

347
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,160
farther or a pitcher through the ball harder, I'm going to do it to see if it'll make me a,

348
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,120
uh, a big voice guy. You see these big voice guys, they make a ton of money. All they do is

349
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,040
sit around a microphone and talk into a microphone for a living. With syringe in hand, I am going to

350
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,240
administer, I think I'm saying that correctly administer. Anyway, uh, here goes.

351
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,800
There, all set. Now we'll just wait and see if it takes and I become a big voice guy.

352
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:18,000
You see what they're doing now? Have you seen these people? I mean, I love them all. You know,

353
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:26,000
members, I'll turn out low. But when you who tell me that Malcolm's mom orders trying to sell

354
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
you, uh, attempting to sleep or see, I invite itself out.

355
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,360
He bought heads radio, check us out online at podheadsradio.com. That's pod.headsradio.com. Thanks for the

356
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,000
plug-time Adam. We're now returning you to the daily source code. I got to tell you, I love it when

357
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,720
people put cool promos together. That makes my job so much easier on the source code. So melt

358
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,440
coming up this week. In fact, I want to do, I want to talk about it today because, um, well, you

359
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,080
in the, the whole nature of podcasting is that you probably are listening to this show on Tuesday

363
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:22,080

373
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,560
to be one of the presenters on the skinny's, the skinny on sports. Skinny on sports.com.

374
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,240
And remember, I told the well, of course, the U.S. trip, I went up to Microsoft,

375
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,000
really on invitation from Erika Hers. Good buddy, but well, good buddy. I know him for a number

376
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,120
of years, Dutch guy, but we actually hung out. We never really done a business, but we have met

377
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,280
professionally a number of times in Netherlands, then he went off to Italy to Rome, I think, and now

378
00:26:51,280 --> 00:27:00,480
he's running Windows Media Center, Player, who how building number 43 or whatever it is on the

379
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,080
campus, and we met with a whole bunch of really, really fun people. That's actually was, it was so

380
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,720
different from, oh man, was I last there, like in 96 or something. It was, you know, like a totally

381
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,760
different company, at least that division in that building was just, yeah, I was kind of rocking

382
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:26,480
and rolling, and there were a couple of the MSN people there, and you know, we were talking a lot

383
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,200
about, obviously some of some of this is under the no-dam announcements rule, right? But we talked

384
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:42,160
about a lot about podcasting, also video podcasting, I actually had some video, cut some cool video

385
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,920
to show them kind of deliver the vision that I had on, on where podcasting is going and what we

386
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,760
can do, and also to help educate them a little bit, and they were very open about that, you know,

387
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,840
saying hey, we don't, we don't really know everything, and we want to learn, so it was a really

388
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,440
good experience, and today, DHL showed up. I just got to get up for a second, hold on.

389
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:15,680
That's what I grabbed this. Actually, it wasn't, I wasn't going to talk about this, but it's so

390
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:25,200
freaking cool. So this box shows up from DHL, and in it is a little mini flight case, you know,

391
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,760
a little metal case with actually more like a briefcase flight case, but totally protective case,

392
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,800
and in it is something I've never, and you're on a big fan of the Samsung, yep, you know,

393
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:44,880
I used to record the show on it, and in it is this little, it's like, what is it? 10 centimeters

394
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:53,840
by 10 centimeters, let's say, it's the Samsung portable media center, and essentially what this

395
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:02,480
device is, it's, it's pretty cool. I'll turn it on here for a second. It's like, it's a portable,

396
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,360
when those media players, it's the whole center, and you turn it on, looks very much like the media

397
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,840
center, you might buy for your living room, and it has a menu, my TV, my music, my pictures, my

398
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,800
video, and then the settings. Basically what it does is it has a really nice screen, you can plug

399
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,320
in headphones, you can sync it up with Windows Media Player, which of course I immediately did downstairs

400
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,880
on Christina's machine, and I was like, well, I mean, this is like Jesus Christ, this is what

401
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,240
what a beautiful thing to send, and I didn't quite get it until I turned it on, and of course,

402
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,720
I can't show this to you, but you know what, maybe I'll just, let me think what I can do,

403
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,000
maybe I just plug the plug the headphones, and I can at least play the first bit for you,

404
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,160
because it totally blew me away. These guys basically put together a 17-minute video, the MSN

405
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:01,120
guys, just for me, so I mean, receiving a gift like this, which they did say I could keep,

406
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:12,880
actually has Brent from not just Brent, but the portable media center team, Microsoft Studios,

407
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,640
MSN, everyone pulled together, and they probably stole this from someone, and we're saying

408
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,720
this to Adam, but it wasn't, it's not even that, I mean, that was really nice, but what they did,

409
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:32,400
the work that went into the 17-minute video, and I can't play it all for you, but I do want to

410
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,320
play just at the beginning. What I'll do is let me just, sorry, that was me pulling the plug out of my

411
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,280
out of my computer, out of my powerboard, now plug that into the, uh, into this portable media player.

412
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,960
There you go, okay, here it is, for Adam Curry, play from beginning, this is going to trip you out,

413
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,640
let me just turn it down a bit, in case it's too loud, this will trip you out, listen to this,

414
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,040
here we go, okay, it starts off with a little animation there, now listen to the first thing

415
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,360
that you hear, here it comes, this is going to, this is going to trip you out, it trip me, this is video.

416
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,880
Hey Adam, it's John Taylor, this is Nick Rhodes, we remember you Adam, whatever

417
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,440
I have, what is this podcasting thing about, and why haven't you sent us something because we're

418
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,960
sending this to you, so basically that's John Taylor, uh, a Nick Rhodes,

419
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,680
from Durand, sitting there talking shit about me, and I was like, it gave me a gimmick goose bumps,

420
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,160
I was like, wow, you know, that was very, very cool, of course they're totally schmoozing me, but

421
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,240
fuck it, I love it, and then, uh, and here comes Brent with a little bit of a hole, podcasting for

422
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,280
dummies, you know, it can't be that far, I mean Adam Curry is getting ready, that's it,

423
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,400
let me go, maybe you want to watch Adam, it's a cool dude, so, um, totally totally, I mean these guys,

424
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:09,840
they got a going on man, I'm gonna plug that, so, oops, I will, uh, obviously be bringing you

425
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:18,160
a more information about this, and this is exciting, yeah, this exciting development, you know,

426
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,160
I've never thought that I'd really be interested in handheld video, and I've had this conversation

427
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,640
with a lot of people, in fact, with the, uh, with the blogcast folks, they were walking around with

428
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:37,280
what is it the, uh, is it the, uh, uh, what is it, or, I can't remember the name of it.

429
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,040
Archio, whatever it is, is that the, uh, the video player, um, I have to take some of that back,

430
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,280
I really, I didn't think that it would be interesting, you know, and who's gonna watch this mobile video,

431
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:55,600
but when you get this device that basically can play MP3s, and we know media files and, uh,

432
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:02,560
odd forbos and wave and you name it and MPGs, yeah, so it kind of starts to hit home, it really does,

433
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:08,160
no, anyway, uh, we'll be talking more about that in weeks to come undoubtedly, okay,

434
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,200
what time are we at now, like 33 minutes, perfect, oh, you know what it's time for,

435
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,440
I'm gonna turn it down a little bit, because people complain about how loud this always is,

436
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:25,280
oh yeah, all you casting with Adam Curry, three, two, one, it's time for the internet with y'all,

437
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,640
pull it, hey y'all, how you doing? Hi Adam, y'all pull it here again with another hit test,

438
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,720
right on, and again, there's always three intros for you to identify, and here's number one,

439
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,680
I'm ready.

440
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,000
Sound of time like human league in the beginning here, but that's, that's not human games,

441
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,880
this isn't a little bit of a name, I gotta say, I think I'm stunned, here's number two,

442
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:10,640
I know that one is, that's uh, my tie with female intuition, I think, Dutch band, Dutch trio,

443
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,360
and the final one, number three,

444
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,040
is that the SOS band?

445
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,360
I think it's the SOS band. Sounded like that little kind of like half cowbell thing going on there,

446
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:37,280
times up, and you're already answered, and so number one in today's in test, is Fox the Fox.

447
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,280
I never would have pressed this little diamond. Oh, it's a title of the song.

448
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,680
Actually, it should have known that.

449
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,080
Now I've got my breath. All right, I recognize the hook now.

450
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,360
Sounds like a time band, right?

451
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,040
Okay, we're all for one.

452
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,600
On to the next one.

453
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:23,040
And then to number two, and number two is a Dutch band called My Tie, and they had a

454
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
really big hit with this song, female intuition.

455
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,520
One for two.

456
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,200
That's the final answer.

457
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,720
It's orange juice. Oh, standing in the rain. The song excites the rain.

458
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,520
Damn, I should have known that.

459
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,160
What a great song, is it?

460
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,680
I can't hear the rain.

461
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,320
Orange juice, Jones, and the rain. Kind of a set song.

462
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,840
I'm going to touch it. You can always have up beats on. That's true. And up tempo song. That's all right.

463
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,080
Well, that's it for today. You know what you have to do with it.

464
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,440
Hit test at gmail.com, and young polette.nl, this is JNPLAT.nl.

465

And Adam, see you next time for the next week.

466
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,640

469
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,600
The finest blues you've never heard. The roadhouse.

470
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:12,960
Hey, Adam Tony Stygler, Denison from the roadhouse podcast. The roadhouse is a weekly podcast.

471
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,760
Featuring the finest blues you've never heard. Every week, I go out and mine the depths of

472
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,520
GarageBand.com. Looking for the best in the pin of blues bands. Now, the roadhouse just

473
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,640
celebrated its fifth edition this week on March 19th. And if you haven't been listening,

474
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,320
here's what you've been missing.

475
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Tell your legacy that I heard and heard and heard you said.

476
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,000
Talkin' in your dream home, and I heard everywhere you said.

477
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,560
Very good.

478
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,000
I started learning.

479
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,760
When I was four years old, I've made it for you and this ride.

480
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,760
Let's go.

481
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,200
I gotta tell you, man. I'm a sucker for some blues. I love it.

482
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,400
Definitely subscribe it to that. I just wonder if it's podcasts.

483
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:36,880
Hey, baby. If I was single, I'd take you home. Treat you right.

484
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,000
Wouldn't be no sleep for the whole day and night.

485
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,000
Get up in the morning with a smile. It's wide and I just sit down a bit off.

486
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,560
It's all over the crowd, but I'm a married man.

487
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,240
Don't blow the past right off.

488
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,040
I mean, that's a long skip the end.

489
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,760
I'm a pro mom.

490
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,800
It's just a success.

491
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,120
Yeah, kicking up our heels and we've been doing it without you. So, come on out and join us.

494
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,360
Come on out. I'm step away from the hits of the 80s for a little bit and enjoy that time once.

495
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,120
Classics are the blues. We'll look for you. And thanks for all you do.

496
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,240
Technically, even though it is for the 21st, something that Patricia and I were talking about

497
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,400
during what the PPP podcast. Remember the days when you would buy an album and the band would

498
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,280
actually put an instrumental on it. You know, these days seems like everything has to be a

499
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,680
freaking single, right? So there's never an instrumental anymore. And Patricia was actually joking.

500
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,400
I think that was in the podcast. Maybe it was just some random conversation we had, but she said,

501
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,280
oh yeah, I know we used to have to do an instrumental or two just to fill up the album because you

502
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:26,240
didn't have enough songs with lyrics. And then I run across this show. And really, my love for

503
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,920
instrumental music is just flow on back and I hope it does for you too. It's not April 1st yet.

504
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
But here's a taste of speeches.

505
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,720
It's speechless. We try and bring you the best of new instrumental music.

506
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,240
For the next few minutes, I hope you enjoy a few samples and selections of our upcoming shows.

507
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:34,640
We are a style independent here at Spichthus. There's as many styles as there are ears to hear it.

508
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,200
And we certainly aren't afraid to leave the planet.

509
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
You

510
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,200
After floating through the void, Spichthus will set you down on the back porch and take you home.

511
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:28,720
And if you're back porch is nothing like mine. Maybe you want something a little bit more

512
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,240
south and west. Spichthus can accommodate you too.

513
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:56,000
Maybe that style's not for you, but yeah, some days we're just going to sit back and chill.

514
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:14,000
I'm where young Homer might be by steam or might be a little bit of that.

515
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:22,080
There's just a ton of fantastic instrumental guitar music out there. Some of it's fairly acoustic.

516
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:36,640
It's some of it ain't.

517
00:43:36,640 --> 00:44:00,000

All righty, sorry this was so late in coming tonight and as I said tomorrow I'm traveling, but

523
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,680
maybe then TV Chronicles with Connecticut, get the time and work out. He's only eight hours

524
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,760
time difference between he was in Portland and actually the nine hours since he was in the

525
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,880
vicinity of my lawyers. Always add an hour when you're near your lawyers. All righty,

526
00:44:48,880 --> 00:45:07,680
everybody helps you to tomorrow take care. Bye, bye.
