1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is the daily source code, episode 186.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is the daily source code coming from San Francisco.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh boy, lots of new stuff in the setup here.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
First of all, I have new headphones.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Not like in the headphones, that much has to do with the setup there.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And I'm messing around with Audio Hygiene Pro.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Can you tell?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The power of the audio is coming.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Today is Sunday.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It is the 20 or the 29th of May 2005 actually according to my watch.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You know what?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It will actually sound better if I have the microphone clip done.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What do you say?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh yes.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is what happens when you do podcasts at quarter to 12, almost midnight.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's okay.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Got some promos, got some pod save music, got a mashup and some stuff to talk about.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Line up on the day's source code.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, to start right off, I'm having a real time monitoring what I'm doing.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Went to the Apple Store in Los Angeles, which is, I forget even what the address is.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They're just giving that shit away at the Apple Store unbelievable.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The lines.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There's so many people buying stuff.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's just outrageous.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I needed new iPod headphones for my iPod obviously, which I also use in the eye river.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I decided to go for what they call the in-ear phone.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And the in-ear stuff.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But it's like, unless you really jam it into your ear, it just doesn't sound right.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It sounds like really light and kind of tinny.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Maybe just don't have the right ears for this stuff.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Maybe, that's the problem.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not liking it too much.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm almost ready to find different set of headphones to use.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Never, never you matter.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Welcome everybody.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is the daily source code.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My name is Adam Curry.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I am at the Hotel Vitale, which is a brand new hotel.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They opened up, I think, just two months ago.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Vitale is spilled, spilled Victor, India, Tango, Alpha, Lima, Echo.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's another one of those wood and metal and glass kind of,

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's kind of a, it's obviously contemporary.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a rather modern hotel.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Not bad though.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I like it.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We just spent the past three days in the Beverly Hills hotel

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in Beverly Hills obviously in California.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And let me say something.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm not staying there again.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Memo to self.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No more staying at the Beverly Hills hotel.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now, is it a beautifully decorated, you know,

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
there's my wires or scraping against my microphone.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm on the live microphone as you can tell.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't have the big mic with me.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it a beautiful hotel that has impeccable service?

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Does it have great food?

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes, yes, yes, to all of the above.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Does it have consistent internet connectivity?

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It seemed like every evening.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And it usually kicked in around,

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'd have to say around 9 p.m.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The bandwidth was just fucking crushed.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There was nothing left.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Nothing worked.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It was dripping in at like 1 or 2k a second and forget uploads.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It was just, it was shit.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And so I called around engineering.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And of course, the outsourced all of this.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So it couldn't get anyone on the phone.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No, it could help.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And it was every single day.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It was the same thing.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It was almost as if someone had like some huge, you know,

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
install of limewire or or kaza or god knows what.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And it was just turning on the porn pipe.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And just leaving it for hours and hours and hours.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And I tried to explain to them.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I said, look, this is the same.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's actually worse.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But let me just give you an analogy.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The same as if you had no hot water.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You know, can I live without it?

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, I can live without hot water.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But do I want to live without hot water?

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's one of the basic essentials of a hotel.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So, you know, until they can absolutely guarantee me that it's going to work.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And by the way, there's no real danger.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going to go back to the Beverly Hills hotel.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The reason we checked in is because we've been on the road.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And we've been in real douchebag, fleebag, dives of hotels.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Which just isn't entirely true.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because the network connection was good.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And that's really all I want.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I just want a television.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And that's really just for background for loneliness.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Please make sure it has spanked television.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I want my internet connection.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know, that's all I want.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And so, if the vitale hotel, it's nice.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They have a wired connection.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They give you a nice ethernet jack.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And on every other floor, they also have a wireless connection.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Which I haven't tried yet.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And see, they have one.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me just check.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll take a look at my thing here.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hotel vitale 7 floor access.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, they have one on my floor, actually.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And it's great.

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's given me great throughput.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And, you know, I could really care less about the hotel to be quite honest.

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh, and hey, go heat.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You know, now that my kind of my second home is South Beach,

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
where we're on less, we're on a vacation.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And the Miami Heat are in the playoffs.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And this is the playoffs.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I guess the playoffs.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Or is this the Eastern Conference?

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Whatever it is.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The kick-and-ass.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
10 points.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They won today.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And I'm not a big sports fan.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And really, I get my sports from the skinny on sports.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I live it vicariously through season ticket holders on Bloom.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And let's roll out a mashup right now.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is a pretty cool one that I found.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, you recognize that.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You recognize that the Kira song anywhere, right?

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is a little different though, it's from DJ Tripp.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Dr. Dre versus the champs.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Then the next to P-Li.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I'll get everybody.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know the way to come back, ball, you beat the ball.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Lock the ball.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The foot's up in the air.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What an air.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Got no time to fight them all.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're burning me dumb.

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Deep deep deep.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Deep deep.

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Deep deep.

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Deep deep.

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Deep deep.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Deep deep.

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Deep deep.

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Deep deep.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Deep deep.

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Deep deep.

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Deep deep.

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Deep deep.

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Deep deep.

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Deep deep.

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Deep deep.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Deep deep.

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Deep deep.

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Deep deep.

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Deep deep.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Deep deep.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Deep deep.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Deep deep.

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Deep deep.

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Deep deep.

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Deep deep.

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Deep deep.

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Deep deep.

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Deep deep.

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Deep deep.

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Deep deep deep.

176
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Deep deep.

177
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Deep deep.

178
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Deep deep.

179
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Deep deep.

180
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Deep deep.

181
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Deep deep.

182
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Deep deep.

183
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Deep deep.

184
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Deep deep.

185
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Deep deep dead.

186
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Deep deep.

187
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Break off the kill and release a C.P.G.

188
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Pick up the beach right door and get ready

189
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Who's the real rolling on door?

190
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Are you crazy looking?

191
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
What?

192
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Brains who didn't come to sin the night

193
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
We're docking the back sip and don't ya?

194
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Cliping all the ants to fit through the water

195
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Calm then you don't be king or woman

196
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Sops and slops to the website

197
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Gotta pour your love

198
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Scallop on your butt

199
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Gotta pour your king or pro

200
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm gonna ruin the might better

201
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Than the city glow

202
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
With my jeans on

203
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
And my jeans roll

204
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Get my drink on

205
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
And my smoke on

206
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
And my smoke on

207
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
And go home with

208
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Some of the folks on

209
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
They're like a stone

210
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
But it's too short for long

211
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Come to real

Roll

217
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500

219
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500

I can't control

221
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Take up

222
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
C.P.

223
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I'll be ready for the next episode

The next episode of the song

309
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:56,500
A person who ineschin Logan

310
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,200
to put like exhaust corrosion on it.

311
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
So it really looked like something

312
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,800
that somebody wrote around like a hot rod.

313
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,800
If you look at Han Solo, he's a bootlegger.

314
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,300
You know, he is the band.

315
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,500
And the Death Star is a biggest smokey cruiser of the mall.

316
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,700
Sports editor Josh Barnett on where fans are with the Phillies.

317
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,000
We sort of passed the in the stages of grief, if you will.

318
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,500
We're really into the anger stage in a significant way right now.

319
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,500
And Ronnie Polleneski on her radical idea for Mother's Day fundraising.

320
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
I am all for racing for a cure.

321
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
I'll walk for a cure.

322
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I'll do anything for a cure, but not on Mother's Day.

323
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Unless it's nothing for a cure.

324
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,500
You'll also hear music you've never heard before by local bands and artists come in the town.

325
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
What you'll never hear on Philly feed is podcasting from an elevator

326
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
and sound seen from a cockpit of a small plane.

327
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
We think you have those areas completely covered.

328
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
So we're going to stick to what we do best.

329
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
A fun, informative, entertaining podcast.

330
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
This shockfully attitude.

331
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
To download Philly feed, go to www.phillyfeed.com.

332
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Philly feed.

333
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
It's the People Paper Podcast.

334
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Very cool.

335
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Philly.

336
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I've been to Philly before when I was going to school in West Virginia.

337
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
It was, oh, what was her name?

338
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
She's a great girl.

339
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
She was really sweet.

340
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
E.D.

341
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
E.D. was her name.

342
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
And she was from Philadelphia.

343
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
And one point, she got me so nuts.

344
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
She said, you know what?

345
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Let's drive from West Virginia to Philadelphia and back.

346
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
And one night, we did this.

347
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
To go see the Flyers play.

348
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
That was the one and only hockey game I've ever seen in my life.

349
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
And quite honestly, I was so tired from driving

350
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
at a Chevy Nova at the time.

351
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Two doors Chevy.

352
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
No, wait.

353
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Four doors Chevy Nova.

354
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
I'm sorry.

355
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Straight six Chevy Nova.

356
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
And I was like an E.D. too.

357
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
So probably that's why I didn't pay much attention to the, to the game.

358
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Never got anything going on with her though.

359
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
But Philadelphia.

360
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Yeah, nice time.

361
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Definitely.

362
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Thanks for the promo guys.

363
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Really appreciate it.

364
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
See what else to have on my notes here.

365
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Oh, yeah.

366
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Hey, I went to the Apple Store because I needed to edit some video.

367
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:13,500
And my drive, I've been basically nursing and nurturing my G4 along

368
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,500
on about anywhere from one to two gigs left of drive space.

369
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
And I've tried to delete stuff.

370
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
You know, and really, it's my iTunes musical libraries.

371
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Really what it is.

372
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
And then you just take into account all the applications and stuff.

373
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
And what is the, what's the total drive size of this puppy?

374
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
It's probably what like 50, 60 gigs I think is what,

375
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
what this G4 has built in.

376
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
So I said, you know, since I'm going to do some editing.

377
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I need do some importing, which would take me well over the gig I had.

378
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Left, I bought myself a little fire wire drive.

379
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,500
This is the fire light smart disk.

380
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
It's really thin.

381
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
It looks like it looks.

382
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
It's probably about the size that the communicators are on Star Trek.

383
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
And it has actually some similar lights.

384
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Really nice power through the fire wire cord itself.

385
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
And it's got a hundred gigabytes on it.

386
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
So that's just perfect.

387
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
And I'm storing shit on that.

388
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
And it's actually something I'm just carry with me.

389
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
And it's not really a real chore to plug that in.

390
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,500
You know, so I can basically use some space.

391
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
We'll keep the space available for podcasts.

392
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I was able to free up some space because while I was at it,

393
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I bought Tiger, which is the new version of OS 10,

394
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
which is what is it.

395
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I guess I should take a look at that here.

396
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I'll say about this Mac.

397
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
It'll tell me I guess.

398
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Oops.

399
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
There we go.

400
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
10.4.

401
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Okay.

402
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
That's what it is.

403
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Nice.

404
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Very interesting.

405
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,500
It seems a little snappier than 10.3.

406
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
So that's good.

407
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I like these.

408
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Was it a call?

409
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
It's Spotlight.

410
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Searchlight.

411
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
What does it call?

412
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Here.

413
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
What was this thing called?

414
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Hold on.

415
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Let me just check.

416
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Spotlight.

417
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,500
So you basically, you type in a couple words.

418
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
And it, I don't know if it's free.

419
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
It must do some pre-indexing.

420
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
But then it goes through your entire drive through your email through PDFs.

421
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Into any file.

422
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,500
And it brings up a list of options categorized by file type that you can then select.

423
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,500
So it's a hell of a lot better than navigating through file folder structures.

424
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I like that.

425
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Also the Automator.

426
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Man.

427
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
The Automator is.

428
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
It's kind of like an abstraction of Apple script.

429
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,500
So if, of course, I know a little bit about Apple script having,

430
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,500
use it to create the iPod or the original iPod or.

431
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Um, it basically has all the commands that you could script in Apple script for applications,

432
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,500
kind of as a set and ready to go block.

433
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
And you can build up a workflow.

434
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
So within five minutes.

435
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
And this impressed the shit out of me.

436
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Within five minutes, I was able to create an application.

437
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
We double click on it.

438
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
It starts recording.

439
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,500
It brings up a dialogue box that says, click stop when you're done.

440
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
So when you're done talking and I just did practice.

441
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,500
This for this test application did it into the built-in microphone on the G4 power book.

442
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
You hit stop.

443
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
It then saves it.

444
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Renames it.

445
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
So of course, I did like daily source code test.

446
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
And then it will put a date stamp behind it.

447
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Turns it into an MP3 and FTP did right up to the server.

448
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
It was like a built it like a five minutes.

449
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I created a podcast application.

450
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
It was really fucking cool.

451
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
So I'm going to delve into that a little bit more like that.

452
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
The widgets are okay.

453
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
I mean, I've been using widgets.

454
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Ever since widgets first came out, which were not done by Apple.

455
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
So yeah.

456
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
All right.

457
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I don't know if I find great use for them.

458
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
It's kind of like a dashboard.

459
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
It's an overlay that flies over.

460
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
What do you have?

461
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
What do we have?

462
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Open on your desktop currently.

463
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,500
And you know, and I have like the calculator and the weather and a couple other things.

464
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
So that's, that's all right.

465
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Of course, I got I like 05.

466
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
So I got the new I movie.

467
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
The upgraded iTunes already came with it.

468
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
The new iPhone.

469
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, it's looking good.

470
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
It's I'm quite happy.

471
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I'm quite happy.

472
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
And I think I've actually convinced Ron to move our to a Mac now.

473
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,500
He's been struggling so much lately with his windows machine.

474
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
It's just.

475
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Sometimes it's a little bit tiring.

476
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Okay.

477
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
I think that's what we do now.

478
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I want to hear some music.

479
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Of course we do.

480
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Let's do another promo because this is a pot.

481
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
This is like this was synchronicity man.

482
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I was looking through some some categories in the directory.

483
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Someone actually said to me, well, what kind of podcast I listen to?

484
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
And I said, well, what do you interested in?

485
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
What are your interests?

486
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
And she said, well, I have a three month old baby.

487
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,500
And so I went into the family note of the iPod.org directory and came across the

488
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Mommy cast.

489
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,500
And one day later, I kid you not without me having said anyone to anything.

490
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
This promo shows up.

491
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,500
The online community radio show dedicated to moms in every country who are holding the

492
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,500
world together one child at a time at www.mommycast.com.

493
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
She moves like she don't care.

494
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Smooth that till.

495
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Cool you out there.

496
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I had him this is page and Gretchen from Mommycast.com.

497
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Our podcast is four moms by mom.

498
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
We've got tips and advice and some really cool interviews.

499
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Adam, we've got seven kids between us.

500
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Oh, yeah.

501
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
We're talking about.

502
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
We love your show and we think other moms will love podcasting too.

503
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
It's convenient and mobile for moms on the run.

504
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
So give us a listen and thanks for introducing us to your audience.

505
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Hey, guys.

506
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Tell your wives about Mommycast.com.

507
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:49,500
The most recent episode.

508
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,500
They interviewed the mom of the year and it's fun.

509
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,500
They got some great topics on there like sibling rivalry and kids hitting each other.

510
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,500
It's funny because I was talking to some people and say, well, what do moms talk about?

511
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
And I say, well, I've stood at the playground.

512
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I've been the designated mom more than once.

513
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
And we talk about kids, you know, talk about kids, whether they're doing.

514
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
And of course, you talk about your husband, right?

515
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
I would expect some of that on the Mommycast as well.

516
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,500
A mention here, the iPod or developers have been working very hard.

517
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
There's a, who is my battery running low here?

518
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Hold on.

519
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I thought I heard my crap out for a second.

520
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
I just checked.

521
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
No, we're good.

522
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,500
iPod or lemon has a new release out with some very cool features.

523
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:44,500
And iPod Rex has released their 3.0 version of the application, getting a lot of great feedback on the new iPod Rex.

524
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Those guys, I think, are doing something very interesting.

525
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:54,500
They're moving much more towards really becoming an aggregator for RSS feeds with enclosure.

526
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:03,500
So it's not just for MP3s, but they can handle PDFs and, well, basically, almost anything you throw at it.

527
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,500
And they're really seeing a world where there's going to be a subscription to all types of media content.

528
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
And I think that's very smart that they're looking at that.

529
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,500
And, you know, next, of course, they should do Windows release and then can really clean up the market when it comes to RSS.

530
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,500
They've also become more of an RSS text news reader and something very interesting.

531
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I'm sure that's only going to be on the Macintosh for a while is they can, you can create a newscast.

532
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:46,500
So you can subscribe to a weblog and it'll bring in the most recent post and it will use the internal Apple speech synthesis text the speech to actually create a voice version of the new updates of those weblogs.

533
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Now, I use Bruce and we're using that voice is actually it's doable, you know.

534
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm not a big text to speech fan because I think sometimes I just can't understand what the hell is being said.

535
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Particularly if slang is used, et cetera, but very cool.

536
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,500
So congratulations to the iPod and developers for all the great work that they're doing.

537
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
All right, now I want to play some pod save music.

538
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
This is something really good.

539
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
You're going to like it.

540
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
It's called push.

541
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
It's on the daily source code.

542
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Push.

543
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,500
To walk away, let me stay, let me reach out.

544
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Search me.

545
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
So slowly.

546
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
I get years.

547
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Yeah, I'm thinking now.

548
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I'm running out.

549
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
I get in there.

550
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
You're logging out.

551
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
You're making so hard.

552
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Yeah, tell me now.

553
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
I have to go.

554
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Yeah.

555
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
You're pushing my hands down in my lips.

556
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
I can't take care of you.

557
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Yeah.

558
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
You're so afraid.

559
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I'm afraid.

560
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm playing you.

561
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
I'm the better.

562
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Who's always messing with your heads and now.

563
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Push.

564
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Let me stay.

565
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
You want to play.

566
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
You want to be with you.

567
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
But you're behaving.

568
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Yeah.

569
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Push.

570
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Don't walk away, let me stay, let me reach out.

571
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Don't let it in this way.

572
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
I have a body roof for the girl.

573
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Who will they walk away?

574
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Play.

575
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
What about the better, girl?

576
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
I don't think they'll hide your words.

577
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I used to go.

578
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Right now I know you.

579
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Yeah.

580
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,500
We get so sexy when we make it dance and snow.

581
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm going to stay.

582
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Yeah.

583
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm not playing you.

584
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
You're just not used to.

585
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Guys, not messing with your heads and now.

586
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Push.

587
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Let me stay.

588
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
You want to play.

589
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
You want to be with you.

590
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
You're behaving.

591
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Don't let it in this way.

592
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Don't walk away, let me stay, let me reach out.

593
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Don't let it in this way.

594
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500
I think you wish I was a different person.

595
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
All together.

596
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
I do believe I am the right one.

597
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
You're running down.

598
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500
If you don't know what I put up with.

599
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Which I'm crazy.

600
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Yeah.

601
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
You're going to regret that day.

602
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
You let me get away.

603
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Yeah.

604
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
You're just not used to.

605
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
You're just not used to.

606
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
You want to play.

607
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
You want to be with you.

608
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
You're all a thing here for you.

609
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Yeah.

610
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
You're just not used to.

611
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
I ever stayed.

612
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
You want to play.

613
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
You want to be with you.

614
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
And be with you.

615
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
You're behaving.

616
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Don't walk away.

617
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
You're just not used to.

618
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
I don't want to play.

619
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
You're just not used to.

620
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
You're just not used to.

621
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
You're just not used to.

622
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
You're just not used to.

623
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
You're just not used to.

624
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Brother Love, push on the Daily Source Code.

625
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,500

626

627
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
He knows how to find it.

628
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500

629
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,500

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,600
to today's Daily Source Code.

632
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,240
We're recorded at Studio483.

633
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,500
We're listening to Urban Family and I am a leader.

634
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,300
Are you sick and tired of listening to the radio station?

635
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,500
Listen to the U.F.N. show, first content delivered weekly.

636
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,300
Listen to a straight couple, a gay couple, and the British homo,

637
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,500
as we discuss life, liberty, and the pursuit of horniness.

638
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,500
You can listen to our show that U.F.N. show.com.

639
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,000
And remember, gay or straight, all men want low jobs.

640
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If the company didn't arrive, we'll set up a lot.

641
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
We'll wait a minute.

642
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We'll just rewind that a little bit.

643
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,500
Oh, no second.

644
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Wait a minute, what was wrong?

645
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
You can listen to our show that U.F.N. show.com.

646
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,000
And remember, gay or straight, all men want low jobs.

647
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,500
If the company didn't arrive, we'll set up a lot.

648
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Okay, U.F.N. podcast.

649
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
All righty.

650
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Let's see.

651
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Oh, it seems like so long ago, but it really was only a week ago that I was in San Diego.

652
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
And got the iTunes demo from Steve Jobs.

653
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,500
And, of course, he announced that the D conference that iTunes is going to be supporting podcasts.

654
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,500
So, I call home twice a day.

655
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
I went on the West Coast.

656
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,500
It's kind of tough because sometimes I'll call like 11 at night and then it's basically

657
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
7 a.m.

658
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
at the cottage.

659
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
And Christine had school last week.

660
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
She's off this week.

661
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
So, I'm not calling this week.

662
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
We're not calling tonight.

663
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,500
And then, you know, I usually call around 11 or 12 noon, which is around 8 p.m.

664
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Or sometimes a little bit later, just before they all go to bed.

665
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
So, and I talked to Patricia.

666
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
You know, she tells me about her day.

667
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,500
And I tell her about how I slept for the past six hours or whatever.

668
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
But with Christina, she's always online.

669
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
She's on the computer.

670
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
She's on a lot.

671
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
You know, and so I can see her.

672
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
She's got Skype and she's got to MSN.

673
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
So, we chat back and forth, just aimlessly.

674
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
And so, she heard about the Steve Jobs thing.

675
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
And she said, that's really cool, Dad.

676
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
But when you get to meet Bill Gates, because I got some shit here that ain't working

677
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
that he's got to fix.

678
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
And I was like, yeah, you go, bro.

679
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,500
He's fantastic with Adam Curry.

680
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
He's back.

681
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
It's time for the hit to go.

682
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
With Yarn Pollet.

683
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Hey Yarn.

684
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Hey Adam, I'm back.

685
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm connected to the internet again.

686
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,500
I hope to be creating hit tests and hit test podcasts in the coming week.

687
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
So, be ready for them.

688
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,500
This is number 39, and this is intro number one.

689
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Pure energy.

690
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
And this is number two.

691
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Okay.

692
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Well, Steve leads with kill me if I didn't know that one.

693
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,500
That's a white room by Creen.

694
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
And the final one for today, this is number three.

695
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Oh, I pointed it.

696
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
We're probably all clapping songs.

697
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Okay.

698
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
That's, uh, cocaine.

699
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Okay.

700
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
Then the first one isn't pure energy.

701
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
And times up, these are the answers.

702
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
This is number one.

703
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
It's the Despant.

704
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Oh, right.

705
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
This is let it all blow.

706
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Oh, good one.

707
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
How did great video, too.

708
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Oh, good one, good one.

709
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Oh, good one.

710
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Sounds a bit like pure energy.

711
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:21,500
The Despant from vinyl is answer number one.

712
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
And this is answer number two.

713
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,500
It's an only from 1968.

714
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,500
It's Creen with a song titled White Room.

715
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:39,500
In the white room with black curtains in the station.

716
00:29:42,500 --> 00:30:06,500
And white room with answer number two in today's hip test.

717
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,500
And this is answer number three.

718
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
It's J.J.K.

719
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
It's all J.J.K.

720
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Oh, and the song is titled Cocaine.

721
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
What the hell?

722
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:30,500
You got to take a round, cocaine.

723
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,500
She know lies, she know lies in her life.

724
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Cocaine.

725
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
The third and final answer in today's hip test.

726
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
J.J.K. Oh, and Cocaine.

727
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Well, that's it for today's hip test.

728
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Adam, there is also a new hip test podcast.

729
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Number 10 is finally released.

730
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Oh, cool.

731
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
So check it out.

732
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Let me warn you that it's different.

733
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
It's more personal than the others.

734
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
It's much longer than the others.

735
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
And it's also a bit scary for me.

736
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
So please let me know what you think about that.

737
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
So check it out at young polette.nl.

738

See you next time.

747
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Bye-bye.

748
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Thank you very much.

749
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Young polette.

750
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Good to have you back, buddy.

751
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,500
And I'm downloading your long personal podcast as we speak.

752
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Young's been going through some health issues right now.

753
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
And I suggest you check out his podcast.

754
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
It's a great podcast.

755
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
It really is.

756
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Because if you want to get to know the guy behind the format that is sweeping the nation.

757
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
And that's going to do it for me.

758
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I am going to upload and hit the head.

759
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Yeah.

760
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Tomorrow will be Monday, of course.

761
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
The actuality is Monday.

762
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
It's Memorial Day.

763
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
So everyone is kind of hanging out.

764
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Hope you actually have time to listen to the show.

765
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,500
And on Tuesday, one last meeting then it's home to the cottage.

766
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:16,500
I have to tell you, I miss my girls, something fierce.

767
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Really good.

768
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,500
You know, even though we get to talk on Skype, email, and some message.

769
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
I miss it.

770
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I really do.

771
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
So these damn hotel rooms.

772
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
Talk into the walls with microphones, strap to my book.

773
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Maybe it's the hardships that make the best art in.

774
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Alright, as always, we'll be back with a podcast.

775
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Almost every day this week.

776
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,500
We're probably doing on the flight back home Tuesday night to Wednesday.

777
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
That will might be posted a little bit later.

778
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
I'll probably report me the report when I'm on the plane or whatever happens.

779
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
We're safe.

780
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500

784

We'll need more mashups.

785
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Where are you guys?

786
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Mashup at podshow.com.

787
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,500

I'm out of here.

00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Take care.

791
