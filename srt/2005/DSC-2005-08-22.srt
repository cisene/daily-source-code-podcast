2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it is your daily source code for Monday, August 22, 2005.

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We have a new week back at the cottage and a whole new setup.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're not going to believe where I am right now.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Actually, you might believe it.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm in the garage in the new setup since it's too freaking heavy to carry upstairs.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will definitely take a picture of this because it's just unbelievable.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You know, my father-in-law built me this podcast table, which he built in the garage where we were in the states on vacation.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And he made it out of MDF so that's really heavy thick wood.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And the thing is just absolutely beautiful.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Of course, I've posted a couple of pictures about it or of it on my weblog, on my flicker page.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When we got back, but this thing is so cool.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I've got new equipment to go with it.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Which of course means that this show may actually not even be recording or it could screw something up.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, let me explain what I have here.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I've got the big setup and today we went to the music store.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We're going to go see if we can get some 19-inch rack rails so that I could put my compressor limiter and all my outboard gear in.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then we started talking to the guy at the music store.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And he showed me this Yamaha Professional Audio Workstation, which is just beautiful.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And it does everything all in one.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's got your effects.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's got your faders.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's got to hard disk recording built right in.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So we're going to give it a shot and see if we can make it work.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Might as well.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a Monday.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So shit's going to break.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is the right data.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Have it break.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And let's get it all kicked off with a mashup.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This was a mashup town's mashup of the week.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We can trip in too.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Recognize the Beatles in there.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're going to date this one.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000

So we started talking to the guy at the music store.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And then we started talking to the guy at the music store.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So we started talking to the guy at the music store.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So we started talking to the guy at the music store.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And then we started talking to the guy at the music store.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, it was we talked to the guy at the music store,

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,360
So new set up, so it may sound a little bit different.

128
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,600
It may not sound a perfect yet.

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,560
In fact, let me just roll off a little bit of high in there.

130
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,040
So this new box that I got is something that I actually think I could take with me on

131
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,040
the road, because we were talking to the guy at the music store saying, look, I want

132
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,080
a little mixer, that I want a little compressor, that I need a microphone preamp.

133
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,480
And by the time we got done, if you look at all that kit, all put together, it's like

134
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:06,480
three boxes, one of which would probably have to be a 19-inch rack size, three power

135
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
supplies.

136
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,080
I mean, just all this stuff, and it's like, you know, that's not going to be very handy

137
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
to carry with me.

138
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,680
And then you show me this professional audio work station.

139
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,840
It's the AW 16G, 16 tracks.

140
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,360
And I spent, like, with my father and all, we spent, like, at least probably about an hour

141
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,960
and a half, just getting all the information from him, figuring out how to do it, how

142
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,800
you can patch channels, reroute stuff through buses, and then it has this hard disk

143
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
recorder.

144
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,280
And actually, you can burn stuff to a CD drive, it's just, it's an incredible machine,

145
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,000
and it has everything all built into it.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,880
Also got a new microphone.

147
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,200
This is, oh, let me see, it's an AKG microphone.

148
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,600
It's something that's very portable that I can take with me.

149
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:57,720
And I'm still using the computer for the sound output, for, you know, I'm using Megaseg,

150
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,360
and oh, by the way, I'm only, I've scrapped the, what I think was probably the trouble

151
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
some fire wire drive.

152
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,840
I'm only using this small portable fire wire drive that I have, where is it not actually?

153
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
It was around here somewhere.

154
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Oh, here it is.

155
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,080
It's the, let me see, the fire light, I think it is.

156
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,640
What is it called?

157
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,760
Yeah, it's a fire light drive.

158
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,600
So this incredible podcast desk that my, my father-in-law, John built for me, is still

159
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,240
on the garage because I have to clean up all my other crap first.

160
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,840
And I have to move desks around and have to move, actually, I think we have to take one

161
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,480
door off of the, of the cottage studio in order to get the, get this thing in.

162
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,200
And then when you'd like two extra guys to help me because it's so freaking heavy, but so far

163
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,960
just standing here and, you know, I put the equipment, just kind of in a temporary setup.

164
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,360
While the mashup was running, I took four pictures so I'll be sure to post those along

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,800
with the show notes.

166
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,520
It's working, I like it.

167
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
It's the right height.

168
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,320
It's, I mean, it's not adjustable, it's my height exactly.

169
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,280
And I've got the mixture in the middle, I've got the laptop on the right, I think this

170
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,200
is going to be a perfect setup.

171
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,400
And on the left, of course, I have my tea and other cool tomals that I need for the

172
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
show.

173
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:24,680
Hmm, we got back Saturday, had a nice trip once again, a fantastic voyage on Virgin

174
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Atlantic.

175
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,960
I actually slept for at least four hours.

176
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,720
The girls, well, Christina slept, Patricia couldn't sleep at all, so she's now completely

177
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
jet lag.

178
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,200
She's been up at all hours the night and sleep in during the day.

179
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,120
And feeling much better, it's too bad about the vacation.

180
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,600
It didn't quite work out the way we wanted it to with us being sick in New York for the

181
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
first week.

182
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,760
And then San Francisco, it being the coldest week in San Francisco ever.

183
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,960
And by the way, as far as I could tell, actually, I mean, look at my, my weather report

184
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
right here.

185
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,360
It looked to me like San Francisco was beautiful this week.

186
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Let me see, London and Amsterdam are going to be horrible.

187
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,920
It's going to be, yeah, San Francisco, they're looking at sunshine every single day.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,840
Oh my god, are you here that?

189
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,920
You can hear the, you can, that's my MDA, making little whining sound there.

190
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,440
So the only thing I don't have here in the garage is Wi-Fi.

191
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,760
I almost could pick up a signal and I'm sure that if I spun stuff around and really did my

192
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,960
best, I could pick it up.

193
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,880
So I won't be able to go through all of my email as usual to talk about stuff.

194
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,400
Actually, I have my Gmail page open here with all my daily source code stuff, you know,

195
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,480
reminders and I guess the, the a couple of things I can see right off the bat.

196
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,880
If, if you hadn't seen it already, the Catholic insider was interviewed on CNN, Father

197
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,280
Roderick, really fantastic.

198
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:01,240
He was at the, at the world youth day and that was in Germany where the pope was.

199
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,080
And he was, he was doing his thing and then he got a really good spot on CNN, which is

200
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,160
very, very cool.

201
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,920
And, uh, oh, man, there's just so much to do, so much to talk about.

202
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm pretty much pretty sure I'm going to be going back to San Francisco next Sunday.

203
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,600
And I'll be there for at least a week, maybe 10 days, just because there's so much going

204
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
on.

205
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,080
We've got the new podshow.com that's going to be launching and we've got a lot of stuff

206
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,280
that's going to go along with that.

207
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,960
I think Friday, this coming Friday, we're just going to do kind of like a soft launch of

208
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,280
some stuff.

209
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,120
And then we'll have, you know, we'll start adding on the bits, uh, yeah, bit by bit, literally

210
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,400
but we've got some amazing things that we're going to be doing there and we'll be talking

211
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
about that.

212
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,320
And, of course, since I'm back at the cottage and I've got everything all, uh, in close

213
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,920
proximity, I can roll out some of those promos again.

214
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:56,040
I say, boldly, God, yes, Ambrose, have you ever heard of Rusty Bandar or Rusty Bandar?

215
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,160
Not since I stopped drinking my shan out of a coffee can, but I have, remember, you

216
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,560
would lock your lock, it was yesterday, but I would scarce be so undelicated to bring it

217
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
up again.

218
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Thank you, Ambrose.

219
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,040
Not at all, but we got, so what is this Rusty Bandar?

220
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Not what?

221
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Who?

222
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Very nice man has himself a podcast, a podcast, whatever is there, well, I'm sure I haven't

223
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,080
finished idea, but I'm told that you listen to it, where the podcast, this is a podcast

224
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,840
called Strange Brain Radio, yes, I have heard of it really, how did you find it?

225
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,680
It was quite good, I would even recommend it, but bless his heart, well, but what ever

226
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:49,720
is the matter, he's just not from sound, well, we can all be perfect, how true, how true,

227
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,720
all the men, jula-fambros, well, absolutely, you know without proper medication, I become

228
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,720
quite nervous.

229
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:09,040
God, Joe, content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

230
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,360
Sing along with a zoo choir in South Africa, swing with sharks and the Galapagos, study

231
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,480
Buddhism in Cambodia.

232
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm here on Earth, we share stories that inspire and delight.

233
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,360
We don't just talk about the world, we bring you the world.

234
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,080
Here on Earth, from Wisconsin Public Radio, subscribe to our podcast at iTunesPodcastAlley.com

235
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,600
and here on Earth, our podcast is so much going on in podcast land, there is so much cool

236
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,400
stuff that's been coming out, we were at the office last week and I was just looking at

237
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,640
the ping page, that's ping.indepotter.org, which I think Marcus was also going to map

238
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,840
to podshow.com, so it'll be ping.podshow.com.

239
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:01,080
But there you can see the most recently updated podcast in the past three hours, ping.indepotter.org.

240
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,760
And yeah, we're just going through this stuff and I was making a whole list of incredible

241
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,200
podcast and I put it into an outliner and I want to feature those on the next podfinder,

242
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,280
which will be coming out tomorrow, also coming out tomorrow, a brand new episode, it was

243
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,480
going to be the fourth and final episode of Spike Lee's Shadowcast of his movie Inside

244
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Man.

245
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,440
But as you'll hear tomorrow on the podcast, Spike was so into it and by the way, we got full

246
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
access.

247
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,800
Human Newman is on the set while they're rolling, excuse me, oh yes, we're back and already

248
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,080
the sincere was hitting me.

249
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,000
As I said, full access, so you can hear what's going on on the set, you can hear Spike

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,640
directing, some of the actors, you have some, some mayhem that happens on the set.

251
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm not going to spoil it for you, but you definitely want to check that out that should

252
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,820
be coming out tomorrow and that'll be in iTunes exclusively, the Inside Man podcast, Spike

253
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
Lee.

254
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,520
And because, well, this I can tell you at the end of that podcast, he totally goes

255
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,720
off and says, you know, this is the last one, this can't be the last one, he's supposed

256
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,560
to do four episodes and then he says, please come back again next week, so it looks like

257
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,360
we're going to have five out of four episodes of Spike Lee's Inside Man podcast.

258
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,520
The online community radio show dedicated to moms in every country who are holding the

259
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,640
world together one child at a time at www.monicaest.com.

260
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:43,720
She moves like she don't care, smooth that film, cool that's it.

261
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,840
Hi Adam, this is Paige and Gretchen from MommyCast.com.

262
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,560
Our podcast is Four Moms, by moms, we've got tips and advice and some really cool interviews

263
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,360
and we even talk about technology with a woman's touch.

264
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,080
Adam, we've got seven kids between us, so we know what we're talking about.

265
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,280
We love your show and we think other moms will love podcasts too.

266
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,920
It's convenient and mobile for moms on the run.

267
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
So give us a listen and thanks for introducing us to your audience.

268
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,280
Hey guys, tell your wives about Monikaest.com.

269
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,240
Yousa, I play that promo before, but the Monikaest is a really kick and some major button

270
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,680
people are tuning in and they're even getting all kinds of attention from movie companies.

271
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,880
They do the, I think they did something about the Penguin movie and it's getting good.

272
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
It's getting really good.

273
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,440
I also, let me see if I can find that if I had to do my outline.

274
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,560
I came across a daddy cast, let me see if this is going to start out, but it's going

275
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,800
to give me problems here and hold on.

276
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:54,360
Here it is, what was it, was it, yeah, 101 uses for baby wipes.

277
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,840
I'll be sure to play that piece of that on tomorrow or maybe when's the source code.

278
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,200
It's really quite awesome.

279
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,480
So this whole parent cast thing is really catching on tomorrow.

280
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,280
By the way, be doing a little bit of flying.

281
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,440
The in-laws are going to go back and that means, yes, I get to fly him.

282
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,560
So wink Amanda Williams will be showing up bright and early and the weather's pretty crappy.

283
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,920
I mean, like really crappy.

284
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,720
It's raining and, as I said, rain is expected for the rest of the week.

285
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,380
So I'm not quite sure if I'll be able to go VFR, which is visual flying rules or

286
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,240
if I'll have to go IFR now, I'm not IFR certified, which means you fly an instruments.

287
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,240
But the wink Amanda, of course, is and he can certainly train me on the instrument.

288
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,600
So if we do go instrument flying, then that'll be some great experience for me.

289
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
So I'm looking forward to it.

290
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,480
I'm going to drop them off.

291
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,200
I haven't quite decided yet if I'm going to stay in an antwerp where the plane currently lives

292
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,960
and then come back on Wednesday morning or from to come back the same night.

293
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
That kind of depends on the weather.

294
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
But I will be taking my new setup.

295
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,880
So I'll be able to do all kinds of stuff on the road, taking the Yamaha Professional Audio

296
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,120
Workstation.

297
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,320
I got to figure out what kind of suitcase I'll have to be using now because if I use just

298
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,640
the overnight bag, I don't know, I don't know if I'll be able to fit my underwear.

299
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,520
But I'm really, really jazzed about this thing.

300
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
And it was cheap too.

301
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,320
It was like 400 bucks and it's got a 20 gig hard drive at anyway.

302
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,440
Enough about all that shit.

303
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,320
Let's see, what else is going on?

304
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,960
I got some pod save music, which I'll play for in a couple of minutes, pod save music

305
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
network also doing really well.

306
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,240
I'm just getting recituated.

307
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
It's good to be back.

308
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,680
It was good to be back in my own environment, good to have my own bandwidth back.

309
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,840
You kind of get used to the speeds that you have.

310
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,000
But at the same time, I'm gearing up for the next trip because I'll be in the apartment.

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,360
So that will be the Kurikondo in San Francisco.

312
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,600
And I guess I'll take the setup with me and be able to use it there.

313
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
So that's all coming up.

314
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,920
And this week, plenty of stuff to do, plenty of recording, plenty of production.

315
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Lots of pod show calls, of course.

316
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,360
Back to living the dual time life where I have my normal day here in the UK.

317
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:19,360
And then around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, people start to wake up, that's 8 a.m. in San Francisco.

318
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,360
And then I have a whole another day to deal with.

319
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:29,640
Comment a few of the world features me, Michael, an ordinary teenager, expressing his views

320
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,040
an audio format, I speak about issues in the world and what's on my mind.

321
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,120
On the proud founder of the teen podcasters network, if your interest did end during the teen

322
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:50,440
view, head on over to comercast.tk, don't miss out.

323
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,880
The multitudes went forth and cast their pods in the direction of all who would listen.

324
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,360
And casting their pods in this manner, they were henceforth known as podcasters.

325
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:22,400
January 1991, the US military goes to war with Iraq, using a media-planet system to control

326
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
information.

327
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:33,040
April, 2003, the US military invades Iraq, reporters volunteer to be embedded.

328
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:41,480
May 2005, a memo containing proof that the reasons for war were fabricated, is found.

329
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:48,040
The American Mask Media ignores it.

330
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,320
In that same year, from out of the ashes of journalism, in the tradition of Norman

331
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:03,760
Miller, Jack Newfield, Seymour Hirsch and Robert Fisk, a journalist appears, a podcaster

332
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,760
emerges.

333
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,240
Exiled in Amsterdam, both Portuguese and the American, he examines the world as the eternal

334
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
outsider.

335
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,240
Ignorant and intelligent, angry and amused, critical and open-minded.

336
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,960
He's everything, the mainstream isn't.

337
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:35,360
He is bicycle mark, and this is his audio-communicale.

338
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,560
Bicyclemark.org.

339
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,280
Bicycle mark, now is a good time to check him out and subscribe, fantastic podcasters.

340
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,320
He's also been known to do some really outrageous sound seeing tours.

341
00:21:49,320 --> 00:22:01,640
But I want to talk about the war on terror and about President Bush, Cindy Sheen.

342
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:10,680
Now Madge Weinstein went to Crawford, Texas, to get some experiential sights and sounds

343
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,640
from what's going on there, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I usually don't

344
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,240
try to get too political, but I don't have a political slant on this.

345
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:28,080
I think a very practical slant on what's going on, and actually having been to Iraq myself

346
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,720
about, was it February last year, so when things were definitely heating up over there,

347
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:45,200
I met with lots of Iraqis, went to six different towns, really got quite a taste of what

348
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,360
life is like there, and what the people are like.

349
00:22:49,360 --> 00:23:03,200
By the way, pre-Sidam Hussein Iraq really was quite a learned country, lots of great universities,

350
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,360
a lot of scholars came from universities in Iraq, and they say that civilization actually

351
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,960
started there, and I've been to the place where they say that that all began.

352
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:25,440
So I think that I have some insight into what's going on over there, and when I listen to

353
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,880
what Cindy Sheen is saying, I think that she is absolutely right, if she wants, and by the way,

354
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,800
anytime a mom tries to organize or organize a protest or a march, it's amillated, because women are

355
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,040
really by default, natural organizers. They're already organizing everything with the kids,

356
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:55,920
right? It's a ballet lesson, soccer, school, other after school activities, dinner,

357
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,120
house cleaning, this is if you're a state home mom, if you add to that, a working mom,

358
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,240
there's a whole another dimension that's going on. And also there's something so

359
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,680
pure about a mom and her child, that's something that no one can deny. Everyone has a mom,

360
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,800
you know, and everyone has that invisible bond with their mom. So when a mom wants to know

361
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:29,840
what the noble cause is that her son died for, then that really hits home, and you can't

362
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:37,840
deny it. You can't go around that, and I think that President Bush is making a large mistake

363
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,080
by not addressing this head-on, because he should be talking to her, and I'd like to actually

364
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,480
be able to hear the conversation, but here's what I think that he should be saying.

365
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:58,240
The war on terror, first of all, is real. And we really started witnessing it full on

366
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,560
on 9-11. That's when it hit home, so to speak. And boy, did it hit home. But the war on terror was

367
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:13,120
going on before that. Many, many years before that, we had embassy bombings, we had a failed attempt

368
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:22,240
at a bombing of the World Trade Center. We had a ship bombed in Yemen. There has been a continuous

369
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,000
and constant attack for years on the United States and the United States citizens, but it hasn't

370
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,560
happened at home. It was happening mainly overseas. And I think that you have to realize that

371
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:43,600
there, when something happens in Iraq, the news media always reports insurgents.

372
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,800
Well, just who are these insurgents? No one ever really stops to explain and take the time to

373
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,680
go through that. Insurgents are not necessarily Iraqi civilians who are pissed off that there

374
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:02,240
are armed forces from another country in their country. Insurgents are, in this case,

375
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,480
the same people who have been attacking the United States and other countries as well, by the

376
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,800
way, the so-called infidels for many, many years is just they've never done it at home.

377
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,520
For us at home, that is. But for them, home is Iraq, home is Saudi Arabia, home is,

378
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,040
well, it could be North Korea. I can't really speak about that because I've never been there.

379
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:38,880
But it is the large portions of the Middle East. And that's where these terrorists have been

380
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:48,560
attacking United States citizens and therefore the United States. What happened is they started to,

381
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,480
well, let's just step back one second. Why are they doing this? This is something that is being

382
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,440
programmed into very young minds from an early age that if you are essentially not Muslim.

383
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,920
And we're talking about radical Muslims here. Again, this is just my viewpoint, but I'm pretty

384
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,880
certain this is what's going down. They're programmed that the infidels must die.

385
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:20,960
And the reasons for that, hard for me to even start to grapple and grasp how that works,

386
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,840
but it is a fact and that's what's happening. So this war on terror, on September 11th,

387
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,360
really moved into the homeland and heartland of our country, the US. Even though there'd been

388
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,320
some previous attempts. So what the United States government has done because it's not just George

389
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,960
Bush who has sent our troops over there. It's the entire government. Everyone voted on this.

390
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,040
And if they want to change that, I'm sure that they can change that whenever they want.

391
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,240
They basically are protecting the United States and the United Kingdom and other

392
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,360
members of the coalition by moving the front of this war,

393
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:12,160
there where the warriors are, where the enemy is. Instead of having them come over here and fight

394
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:20,320
with us on our own turf. That's really, I think, the only practical situation that makes sense

395
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,360
for why we have 150,000 plus troops over there right now. And they are fighting these

396
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,600
extremists who want to kill us. So if you were to pull the troops out,

397
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:43,440
it is my view that then that front would subsequently move back to the United States. And the

398
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:51,760
only way to make sure that it would not hit home is by intensifying our borders, security,

399
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:59,040
which is almost impossible. Already, you know, I guess the best that can be done is being done.

400
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:09,520
And I don't think it's just a, it's not a workable situation because the extremists want

401
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:16,880
to come and kill Americans and right now the easiest place for them to fight and fight they will,

402
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,960
no matter what, is where the Americans are. In this case, they're heavily armed and well trained

403
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:32,480
servicemen and service women. So until we can get to the root of the problem and the root,

404
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,960
really, and I believe that that can only be solved through social awareness. So when you have,

405
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:48,720
like in the UK, you have imons and other religious leaders condemning any attacks,

406
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,240
explaining that the Muslim religion has nothing to do with violence and that these are

407
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:02,960
pure extremists that really are misusing religion for something cultural that they have

408
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,680
that has been programmed into their minds. That's a good thing because that's the only way you

409
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,080
can start to change some of that perspective in these young minds is getting that message out there.

410
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:22,800
And essentially, keeping all of these people that are dangerous, keeping them out of our shores.

411
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,480
So that's a really long-winded way of saying, I believe that that is why the troops are in Iraq.

412
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,000
It is not about oil. And I thought about it and I must say that it's easy to

413
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,600
slip into that thought. But if it really were about oil, then wouldn't we have lower prices?

414
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,000
Wouldn't we have more oil coming in? No, quite the opposite in fact is happening and here's a

415
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,960
little bit of perspective on the gasoline prices. Explain to me, if gasoline prices are now at

416
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,160
record highs, not historically if you translate today's dollar versus the dollar in the 80s or the

417
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,640
dollar in the 70s, but still it's unbelievably expensive by any standards. And now it's

418
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,920
really starting to hit the economy. What is it? I mean, we have these high prices, but then on the

419
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,600
other side of the fence, every single one of the oil companies has reported record profits.

420
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:33,360
Now profit is money that's left over. After you've already bought your raw materials and

421
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,840
you've got your machinery and your refineries running. So if it's costing us more and they're making

422
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,200
more profit, then the only thing that makes sense to me is that that is literally that money is going

423
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:52,960
from point A to point B. And it's not because there's a shortage of oil. There may be some kind of

424
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,720
superficial shortage or some make-believe shortage of refinery capacity. That's something I keep hearing.

425
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:10,480
But it's not because we're in Iraq and now we have this free flow of oil coming in. It makes no sense.

426
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,640
If anything, I think that the president should make a stand against these fuel companies,

427
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,600
because what they're doing is essentially price gouging. I don't know what the situation is that

428
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,400
they're taking advantage of other than just jacking up the price. To me, it smells of price fixing

429
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:35,680
and price gouging and lots of un-American activity. So that's the second part that President

430
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,920
Bush should be addressing. Now if we got those two out of the way, then maybe we can start to

431
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,960
have a constructive conversation on both sides of the fence, because after two weeks in the states,

432
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,000
this whole red state, blue state thing and they think and they don't know and these,

433
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,960
you know, it's like it's divided. It's a divided country and it's and that's the only thing

434
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:02,240
that is not, you know, America's great, but this is not right, this division. And I don't

435
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,280
think we should be looking at it black or white or red or blue, because it's just not that simple,

436
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,280
but we definitely need to have a re-explanation of what exactly is going on in Iraq. And the

437
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,160
news media have to start, particularly television news media, it really has to start explaining

438
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:29,280
better, you know, just saying, oh, there was an explosion, an IED was that improvised explosive

439
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,760
device set off by insurgents. Who were they? Okay, I want to know where they come from, what was

440
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,000
their background? You know, where's the reporting on that? I'm not seeing any of it, because I'm

441
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,720
pretty sure we're going to find out it's not Iraqi civilians. It's any crazy MF from anywhere in

442
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:53,040
the world, just wants to take pot shots at Americans. And, you know, they can go through very

443
00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:00,480
complicated, expensive procedures and try and get smuggled into into the West and do their damage

444
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,800
on our shores, or they can just go over to where the, where the other guys are with guns. Oops,

445
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:15,200
what is that? Oh, that was just a text message. And they can go fight there. And so essentially,

446
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,480
that's what's happening. That's, that is the only practical reason I can see why we are in Iraq.

447
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,640
And if I'm wrong on this, then I really don't understand it. But this is what I've seen, and I know

448
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:33,520
that the Iraqi people don't hate the Americans. They don't like their situation at all. And they

449
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,160
certainly don't like the fact that their country is being used as his battleground, but it is not

450
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,120
the US against Iraq. And if, you know, people would say, oh, you have to, you should be in Afghanistan.

451
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,600
That's where Osama bin Laden is. Again, I'm quite certain that most of the

452
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:05,280
radical, call them insurgents, but radical haters of the West that they're all now on this battleground

453
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,080
that is Iraq and the Surahams T.C. and Baghdad. What you never hear about, by the way, is the

454
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,760
rest of Iraq. There are at least nine other camps. And, you know, very little is happening there.

455
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:25,520
So this is a front. It is a war. And I, for one, am very happy that it is not in the United States.

456
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,480
So we don't have urban warfare on our streets. I know that sounds egotistical, but I really do mean it.

457
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:42,240
And I fully support our servicemen and women who have been sent over. And, you know, there's no draft,

458
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,680
so these are professionals. And I can totally understand how freaked out you must be if, you know,

459
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,320
your family member is called up into service, you know, because they were in the reserves.

460
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,280
You know, it's, you never expected that to happen, right? But that is the deal, you know,

461
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,720
that is the way it works. If you're in the reserves, then you can be activated. And that's just a deal of.

462
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:16,320
And, you know, it's, it's a bummer, but it can happen. So all of all of these troops who are over

463
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:24,080
in Iraq, they are really, I feel really are there for a noble cause to keep all this crap away from us,

464
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:31,040
away from our country, away from our countries. And, and that I believe is what George Bush should be

465
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,040
telling Cindy Sheen and the world if it is indeed true. If he doesn't, if he comes up with some other

466
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:44,960
story, yeah, then we're all fucked. Anyway, time for some pod save music, I hope that that kind of

467
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,600
came out in an understandable way. It's very difficult material to deal with, but it's been kind of

468
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,800
bubbling up inside, so just had to get it out.

469
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:39,920
Yes, I'll fill my head and spell my tears in one time, in one time, in one time,

470
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:59,440
I will see, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, I will see.

471
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:27,440
I saw time around your feet once, when you see the blink of an eye falling on a cold heart,

472
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:44,080
seeing it your more can take your place, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time,

473
00:38:44,080 --> 00:39:03,600
I will see, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, I will see.

474
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:36,560

477
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,000

478
00:40:37,520 --> 00:41:07,520
in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time. in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in one time, in another one time, in one time, in two time, in one time, in one time,
