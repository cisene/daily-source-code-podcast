1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 1-9-4.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The Bayer Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Barbara Santa Maria division.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The people of the State of California planted it versus Michael Joe Jackson defendant.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Case number 1-1-3-3-6-0-3. Count 1 verdict.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're the jury in the above entitled case by the defendant not guilty of conspiracy as charged in count one of the indictment.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And we're not in the program because there's no reason to reach out and you should see.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Give me a lot of love and feel the hope that we've been waiting for

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We love you, we love you, we love you, we love you

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Give me a lot of love and feel the hope that we've been waiting for

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We love you, we love you, we love you, we love you, we love you

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And you don't see it all

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And we go

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And we're doing great

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We'll stand and shine and jump over us

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're running like that

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Into the morning there's too much to go

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh wow

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's like a different way

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's like a different way

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's like a different way

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's like a different way

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's like a different way

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's like a different way

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Brothers, oh, you've never heard of me

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm great on the way

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,500
And you're losing it so jobably

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,000
Tell me the heart

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're the real son, Javier

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And you're the hero of your day

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And you're the hero of your day

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,500
Everybody be glad

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Because the sun is shining, Javier

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
And everybody wake up

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Into the morning and into a happy day

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Hello, hello

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
It's like a different way

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm in this night

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
In your world

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
We don't sweat, we be free somehow

44
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
We're in love with you

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Make sure the heart that we've done and see

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
We're talking to you

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Brothers, oh, you've never heard of me

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
You're the real one

49
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
You're the real one

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
And you're the real one

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
You're the real one

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
You're the real son

53
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,500
And you're the real hero of your day

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
And you're the real one

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,500
And you're the real one

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Dad gets a shameful life

57
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
At a curry

58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
He came with him

59
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
And I'm Carrie

60
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
He's old way

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,480
Into the heart

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,500
MovyingÃ¨ve

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
From when I'm Carrie

64
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Through past them, three tombs started.

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
His name is Anon Kari.

66
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
And bow him, vision's blind.

67
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
The old tombs died.

68
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
And the three tombs died.

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
His name is Anon Kari.

70
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
His name is Anon Kari.

71
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,500
His name is Anon Kari.

72
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
His name is Anon Kari.

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,500
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

75
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Hey, everybody. It's Tuesday. It is June 14, 2005.

77
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Yes indeed, not guilty on all counts.

78
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
You think I want to talk about that today?

79
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah, I think so.

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Oh man, first of all, I get to say I told you so.

81
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
We'll just get that out of the way right now.

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,500
We'll be talking about Michael Jackson, the verdict, and what it means to America and the world in general,

83
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
because it does have significance.

84
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,500
It is about one thirty-five in the afternoon on Tuesday here in Kari Cottage,

85
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
bringing you the data source code.

86
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Oh man, it was busy this morning.

87
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,500
We've got up and actually Christina was not feeling well.

88
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
You're going to love this.

89
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,500
She yesterday she had to take a cake to school as a part of a food technology.

90
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Yes, it's a technology now, cooking.

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
But it's a very creative school.

92
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
So she made her ask-out cake.

93
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I have to post a picture in the show now.

94
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
She'll love what this thing looked like.

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
But she got some red food coloring die on her skin.

96
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,500
And she immediately broke out in an allergic reaction.

97
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Which was, it's kind of scary in a way.

98
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
You know, it's just a red die on her hand.

99
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
And then of course she rubbed her face.

100
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
And she got, you know, a face star to swell up a little bit.

101
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
And she's never had anything like that before.

102
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
She didn't feel too well last night.

103
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,500
So we kept her home this morning from school because she just wasn't feeling good.

104
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Although a mac and miraculous recovery.

105
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Because tonight, of course, is the wiser concert at Brickson Academy in London.

106
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
And I've got tickets thanks to Aaron from Bitterman Circle.

107
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
So I'm going to have to go to the gym and on a feeling sweaty and mucky and pumped up.

108
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,500
But ready to bring you an awesome daily store's code with some pod safe music on the way.

109
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Of course, I'm talking about Michael Jackson.

110
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
And did I mention it?

111
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
This is the show where we just love to bring you mashups?

112
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Well, check this one out.

113
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

114
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Green Day versus Oasis versus Travis versus M&M.

115
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,500
And I hope you had sent it in on the daily source code.

116
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Brick us, but it's only me and I walk along.

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Two days going to be the day that they've got to throw it back to you.

118
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,500
I want this empty sheet on the boulevard of Broken Dreams.

119
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Where the city sleeps in the middle of the night walk along.

120
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,500
But by now you should have somehow realized what you got to do.

121
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I walk along, leaving everybody feels a way to go.

122
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I'll show you how to make shadows all in one of what's beside me.

123
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Make shadows all the way to the only thing that's needed.

124
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Sometimes I'll tell you where someone will find me.

125
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Two days will not walk along.

126
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,500
If you don't come back someday.

127
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,500
I walk along, leaving everybody feels a way to go.

128
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:34,500
I'll show you how to make shadows all the way to the only thing that's needed.

129
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I walk along, leaving everybody feels a way to go.

130
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Back then the weather's on the street that the fire ringing out is out.

131
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I'll show you how to make shadows all the way to the only thing that's needed.

132
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,500
I'll show you how to make shadows all the way to the only thing that's needed.

I'll show you how to make shadows all the way to the only thing that's needed.

155
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:29,140
We'll have our broken songs, Green Day vs. Oasis vs. Travis vs. M&M. Ed Hagopian sent a whole mess of mash-ups to

156
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,820
mash-up at podshow.com. Thank you very much Ed. Very much appreciated. Love here. I love that Oasis

157
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,700
tracking. The lyric that gets me is a backbeat word is on the street that the firing your heart

158
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:47,220
is out. Man, that's awesome. Everybody, here we go. Let's break down for a second here. Lots to talk

159
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,940
about today. Of course, I have plenty to say about the Michael Jackson verdict that coming up in

160
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,140
just a little bit on the source code. Thank you very much for subscribing and checking us out. Let's see a

161
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,220
couple of... First of all, did I mention how much I enjoy doing this show every single day? I really

162
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:09,860
love it. What makes it so cool is the feedback that I get. It comes in through email, through MP3s,

163
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,260
people on the street. It's really nice. Thank you. We talked about blindcasters yesterday,

164
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:27,060
about accessibility on the Mac, accessibility on Windows, and we played a little bit

165
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,580
from Shelley Brisbane yesterday, and I got to several comments about that. Here's one. I just

166
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,500
been listening this from Wayne Taylor, by the way. Shelley Brisbane has said that Windows doesn't

167
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,260
include a screen reader, as far as I'm aware, the Microsoft narrator has been included with Windows

168
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,740
since Windows 2000. Not knowing much about screen reader applications. I can't say if the screen

169
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,580
readers any good or not, however, there is one out that just thought I'd like to get this point out

170
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,140
there on the show. Okay, so apparently, and I got a couple of emails about that. Now, I don't know

171
00:11:53,140 --> 00:12:00,100
if this Microsoft narrator is worth its salt, so I'd love to hear about that. Let's see. Jerry

172
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,620
Hallithen says Apple is once again made a cutting edge move by including a built-in screen

173
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,860
reader or screen reader in OS X Tiger. Windows users have to buy an additional screen reader.

174
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,020
Well, apparently, that may or may not be true. A problem is, while Apple encourages developers

175
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,940
to follow their guidelines for making apps accessible, Apple themselves have it followed their

176
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,980
own guidelines. As a member of the blind community using Apple's voiceover, that's standard in OS X

177
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,900
Tiger. Now, not having access to iTunes is so incredibly disappointing. I love Apple,

178
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,020
I've always used their products, but in this case, they're falling short of their own goals.

179
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,140
Hey, next time you have Steve's ear, how about mentioning the fact that iTunes is still

180
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,260
inaccessible? I'm sure he hasn't a clue. Well, I'm sure he's listening, so he heard that.

181
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,500
Let's see what else do we have here? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. If you've never heard the

182
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,780
skinny on sports, the fastest 10 minutes on your iPod, it's brought to you my Matt and Andy

183
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:57,860
Skin, who were up in up in Canada, and Andy Skin sent an email to me and to Ron and to Brian,

184
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,420
our operations officer at Pod Show, just some stuff. But at the end, he just kind of put a little

185
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,380
PS there, which I thought was interesting. He said, I officially passed my PhD in medicine,

186
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,140
medicinal, and medical science today. So I guess that makes me doctor skin now, which indeed

187
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,500
does sound a bit like a porn star. Congratulations, dude. I'd rather wanted to listen to someone

188
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,180
you don't know, talk about things you don't care about in a way that hangers,

189
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,300
offense, and probably upsets you. Oh, my, yes. Well, you're in luck. You can listen to the

190
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:33,700
starcast, a podcast about politics, entertainment, technology, humor, stupid bits, and lots and lots

191
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:40,180
of swearing. It's like the entire internet in one easily downloaded file for your listening

192
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,060
convenience. You're listening to a starcast. I'm pulling yours for that,

193
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,700
I'll see you all for this a bit more interesting. Check out the latest wildly acclaimed episode

194
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:56,020
of the starcast on the web at starcast.com. What's the, uh, I love your website, your starcast,

195
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,660
are all new to your podcast, um, all the podcast, uh, what's your internet, how I care.

196
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:09,460
Yeah, woohoo! The starcast for slightly the reason why you shouldn't let just anyone produce a show.

197
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,460
Holy crap!

198
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:21,300
Ah, Joe, content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

199
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,380
This is Rob from podcast 4011, and this is the strangest of the strange podcast review.

200
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,180
In today's review, we'll be looking at the daily download by Chris Rockwell. The concept

201
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:56,660
behind this podcast is rather simple. Chris records his podcast each day, while he's going to the

202
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,820
bathroom, hence the name, the daily download. This is truly toilet humor. But Chris doesn't

203
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:10,100
in a very, I hate to use the word tasteful manner. He mixes in good comedy and original ideas

204
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:17,300
including poop experiments, where you the listener get to send in ideas for Chris to do

205
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,140
different experiments. The sound quality on this podcast is excellent. Sometimes,

206
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,100
too excellent if you've listened to the podcast you know what I mean. This podcast is definitely

207
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,700
not for everyone. It's not for those that get grossed out by bodily functions. But if you're looking

208
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:40,900
for humor, this is an excellent podcast. You can find this podcast at apeboymonkeygirl.com.

209
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,060
That's apeboymonkeygirl.com. Now, it's not the number one downloaded podcast on the internet,

210
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,500
but Chris is definitely making a push towards number two. Until the next time, this is Rob at podcast

211
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,940
4011 reminding you to listen different. Here's some rather appropriate music to leave you

212
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,940
with.

213
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
Got to love that smell.

214
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,100
4011 review, strangest of the strange review of the daily download. Good feature, actually.

215
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,740
I guess it would make sense for anyone who appeared on the podcast 4011.com podcast to get a review

216
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,180
and that to be distributed and people can play that in the show. It was digging that very much.

217
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,380
Excuse me, if you have a promo by the way, just fire it off to submit at podshow.com.

218
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,220
Happy to play it. Just send it off to us. That's really all you got to do.

219
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,060
Some podsafe tunes right now. I'm going to slow the mood zone just a little bit.

220
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,100
This is something different for the source code.

221
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:58,260
It's a new age style solo piano piece. Rob Costlow and I do.

222
00:19:50,500 --> 00:20:15,300
I really like that. I almost want to put words to it. Then again, I think I'll be great for a movie.

223
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,100
Of course, it's easier to write words to make a movie.

224
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,100
I like to do something where it's really, really nice. Sorry about the drop out there.

225
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,940
Just another little glitch. Not doing it on the on the crapplet today on the on the cast blaster.

226
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,620
I figured I'd just use this set up. I didn't have a lot of time to reroute all the wiring,

227
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,540
so I'm just leaving it the way it is. Okay, time to talk about Michael Jackson. All right.

228
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:43,780
So as listeners to this podcast, I have been saying that Michael Jackson is innocent. I've been saying

229
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:51,300
that from day one, I've been very outspoken about it. And there you go. He got not guilty verdict on every single

230
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,780
count that was brought against it. Now, why do I? Why was I so sure of this? First of all, I've met him.

231
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:04,820
And if anything, the guy is asexual. I know that is very hard to understand, but some people just are.

232
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,820
Some people just aren't thinking about that. Some people just doing other things with their life.

233
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,140
And just choose to be that way. And I think Michael Jackson is one of those people. You can kind of feel it.

234
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,580
You know, if you're in a room with people, you can feel what they're, you can kind of feel their aura.

235
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,100
And even though when I met him, there were tons of kids around. I think I told the story before.

236
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:32,260
I was in the studio. He was there. How we Mendel was there with just tons of kids. And of course,

237
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,460
how he was doing all those voices and the kids were loving it. And it really was just a fun atmosphere with

238
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:43,060
kids running a boys and girls, by the way. All kinds of kids running around. You can just kind of feel it.

239
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:51,460
You know, it's just a good, relaxed vibe, a good atmosphere, but nothing at all sexual. And that just did not

240
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,220
emanate from the man. Secondly, I know what it is to be be raided and raked over the calls by the press,

241
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,740
not to that level, not at all. I've never been accused of anything like that. But I've had accusations.

242
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,940
And once they show up in the press, um, everyone copies it. In fact, let me make a note. I should

243
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,700
make a note to my copy paste culture essay that I wrote a couple of years ago on a copy paste culture.

244
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,420
I'll put that in the show and know it's on the daily source code.com and www.curry.com.

245
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,140
So you can read that again because it really is that way. And it's not just in mainstream

246
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,140
media. It's everybody. It's how we learn, it's how we grow. We copy things. We paste them.

247
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:34,260
We emulate our heroes. And when it comes to mainstream media, if it's written up somewhere,

248
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,740
and if it's okay for a major publication to call someone wacko, jacko, or the gloved one,

249
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,540
or any other derogatory comment, then, you know, it kind of gets copy pasted. Everyone says,

250
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,540
oh, okay, I can kind of do that. And it becomes a meme and it becomes fun to do.

251
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,940
Um, but it's, um, it's not right. And it's very, very hurtful and very,

252
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:02,260
it potentially very, very damaging. Now, is Michael Jackson, um, is he, is he off-scot free?

253
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,420
Did it? Is everything okay? No, he'll be fucked up for the rest of his life because of this.

254
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,940
You can't trust anyone. Once you've been in a courtroom and you see your former employees,

255
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,220
talking shit and you see people lying. And now, now, look at television for a moment. And this

256
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,100
is really important. We talk about this. So after the not guilty verdict came in and actually,

257
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,580
I was upstairs in the studio last night and Patricia said, oh, they're about to hand down a verdict.

258
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,500
And I said, really? And yeah, so I checked Google and Google said, yeah, 145 p.m.

259
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,700
You know, they're going to come with a verdict. So, of course, it was 215 p.m. p.s. t. when the verdict

260
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,860
finally came. And, um, it was funny because I could see I was skipping through the channels.

261
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:47,460
Now, every channel had, uh, was bringing the audio live. Everyone had their spin micers talking

262
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,460
about it. And it was all about, you know, so what happens? What do you go to jail?

263
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Will you immediately be, you know, will you be able to go home first? Can you get his toothbrush?

264
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,940
You know, and all that stuff. And once the not guilty verdict was in the first thing that

265
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,980
almost everybody said on American television, I can receive plenty of that over here, was, oh,

266
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,900
not guilty doesn't mean innocent. And that is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard.

267
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,940
Because you're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. So to say, well, he wasn't proven

268
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,620
guilty, which me doesn't mean he's not innocent is fucked up. And you really go against everything

269
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:30,180
that the United States stands for guilty until, uh, not guilty. Fuck, I can't even say it now.

270
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,460
Innocent until proven guilty. So that means not guilty is innocent. That is the equation.

271
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,940
There's nothing more nothing less. But he has been raked over the calls. And, you know,

272
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:46,260
we really, as Americans, I'll count myself as an American. We really should be extremely ashamed

273
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:54,340
of what happened here. Um, the, we all ran with it. I didn't personally, um, but it was tempting.

274
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,340
It's tempting to make jokes. It's tempting to go along with the flow. But we've really, really

275
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,060
hurt someone. And there's no way you can make up for it. Of course, now, uh, I, in, in the gym, I saw

276
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,260
that MTV and VH1 and everyone's now playing Michael Jackson videos. And it's the evolution of

277
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Michael Jackson. It's like you're, you're, you're hypocrites. All of you hypocrites. Just nasty.

278
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,060
There's only a couple people who said Michael Jackson is innocent. Um, that I know of. And

279
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Harold Orovera, okay, put me in, uh, in a box with him. That's fine. But, um, this, this was, this

280
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:34,660
really bothered me. I'm so happy, um, that, uh, that Michael was, uh, acquitted, essentially, of every single

281
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:41,300
of these accusations. And it's, uh, interesting because Christina said, uh, my 14 year old daughter

282
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,060
said last night, she said, you know, it's really the same everywhere you go. So this goes outside

283
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:55,300
of the U.S. She said, if you're different, then people don't understand you and they tend to

284
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,500
put you in a corner and make fun of you. And it's about, you know, being different. And then I thought

285
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,980
myself, wow, that's, um, first of all, you know, she feels that she's different in a way. And of

286
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,700
course she is, she doesn't have, I'd say, quote, the traditional parents or quote, the traditional

287
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:18,180
lifestyle or quote, the traditional or normal upbringing. But what is normal? What, when you say someone's

288
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,380
different, different from what am I the same as my neighbor? Are you the same as your neighbor? Are you,

289
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:30,020
is your family the same way? Do you have the same issues? Probably not. So what is normal? And then

290
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,380
it hit me. Of course, it's whatever television says is normal. And I'm not talking just about

291
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:43,620
sitcoms. I'm talking about whatever is portrayed on television. And that comes from news outlets,

292
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:49,940
it comes from predominantly from commercials. That's really where it comes from. And just spinning

293
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,700
a little bit further on that. Of course, it's smoked a joint by then. So I was really into it.

294
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,940
And I was talking to Patricia and Christina, you know, so we're, we're, we're philosophizing a

295
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,940
philosophizing. Yes, we're philosophizing about this. And I was saying, you know, as as a helicopter

296
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,140
pilot, I can really imagine a mini helicopter view going up maybe not too high, 200, 250 feet

297
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,900
and flying over all the houses. And just remove the roofs for a second in your imagination here.

298
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,020
Because I know you can see it right. You're 250 feet above a city or a town. You're on city. Just

299
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,420
imagine that and you're flying over your house on a couple of their homes. Now the roofs are off.

300
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,140
And what will you see every single night? You'll see all of these families doing the one thing

301
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,940
that is considered normal, namely watching television. You're sitting there and you're being programmed.

302
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,460
You're being programmed by anyone who has the frequency, anyone who has the channel. They are

303
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,220
telling you what is normal. Are they doing this on purpose? No, it's a game. What they do is they

304
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,260
tell you, this is the way you should be. And this is the product you have to buy to be normal.

305
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:01,700
And by the way, look at the commercials. Look at what you're brain. This is really red pill blue pill

306
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:07,060
stuff. Look at what your brain is taking in. Look at that information for a second. It's unbelievable.

307
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:12,580
And by the way, everything is sexually related in commercials and advertising. All of it's about,

308
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,300
you know, you won't get laid. That's basically, you won't get laid if you don't buy this product.

309
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,820
We're being programmed. That's why podcasting is so wonderful. That's why web logs are so

310
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,740
wonderful. That's why we're trying to pull this into the mainstream. Get some of, let's change advertising.

311
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,060
You know, let's bring some of that advertising into our space and we can change it. I really

312
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:40,100
truly believe that. And there will be enough diversity that no single person or no organization

313
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:45,540
can hold the key to programming your brain. And this is the time when I do it once every half

314
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:52,020
year where I say, please take the XN TV experiment. The XN TV experiment, I don't want to, of

315
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,900
course, put a link to it in the show notes is a wonderful written experiment that you can take

316
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,260
at home that will help you understand what television is doing to you and doing to your brain.

317
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,580
And you're not relaxing when you're sitting in front of the TV. Your brain is an overdrive.

318
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:12,020
It's filling in blanks. It's making assumptions. It is taking assumptions and putting those

319
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,660
in the places where it's potentially even dangerous. So, you know what I should do? I should

320
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,220
do an audio version of the XN TV experiment. That's something I'm going to work on for this week.

321
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,060
And all in all, if you really want to understand Michael Jackson, there's one very simple way.

322
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,540
It's just go listen to his art.

323
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:55,300
Looking around in the lost and found at my heart, no one understands.

324
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:36,580
Such an imagery means. So, you've learned my fate to compensate for the child.

325
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,460
I've never known.

326
00:30:43,460 --> 00:31:01,540
You've seen my child in my heart. I'm searching for that wonder in my ears that hurts

327
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:16,500
and that picture's dreams. I'm requesting and being on the ground before you touch me.

328
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:31,380
Try hard to love me. Look with me, your heart, the internet.

329
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:41,540
You've seen my child in my heart.

330
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,340
So

331
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,340
You won't change dreams that bring

332
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:19,580
Because I love such unTMITRIED things.

333
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:30,940
It's been life made to compensate for the child.

334
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:41,540
I've never known.

335
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:47,540
Have you seen my childhood?

336
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,540
I was searching for that one therein, my youth,

337
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,540
like a fantastic one.

338
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,540
Stories to share, dreams I would dare.

339
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:06,540
Why do you love me?

340
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Why do you change me?

341
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:17,540
Why do you want to love me?

342
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,540
The pain for you.

343
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,540
I pay.

344
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:46,540
Have you seen my childhood?

345
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.

346
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
Okay.

347
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,540
Michael Jackson, that's the theme from Free Willy.

348
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,540
Thank you very much, Mike from Cas Blaster for sending that into me.

349
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,540
All right, everybody.

350
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:05,540
Let me just backslash on the Michael Jackson stuff.

351
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
Hey, I'm Bolette.

352
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,540
It's time for the hit.

353
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,540
With Yarn Poles.

354
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Hey, everybody.

355
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
This is hit test number 43.

356
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Again, recorded with a bed of 14 of Cas Blaster.

357
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
Right on.

358
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
Let's start right away.

359
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
Three intros and three answers.

360
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
This is intro.

361
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,540
Number one.

362
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,540
Oh, yeah, like that one.

363
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,540
That would be one of these nights by the Eagles.

364
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,540
One of my favorites.

365
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,540
And this is number two.

366
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,540
Okay.

367
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
Oh, yeah.

368
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,540
Oh, I love these.

369
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,540
That's, um, yellow.

370
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Don't bring me down.

371
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,540
Two for two, I think.

372
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,540
And the final one is always number three.

373
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,540
Yes, that would.

374
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
Yeah.

375
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Of course.

376
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
How appropriate is that?

377
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,540
The girl is mine, Michael Jackson, and Paul McCartney.

378
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,540
I think I got them all three this time, y'all.

379
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
Okay, times up.

380
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
They're all pretty easy, I guess.

381
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,540
So I guess you'll have three out of three.

382
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,540
And this is answer number one.

383
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
The Eagles.

384
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,540
One of these nights.

385
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
And check.

386
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,540
One for the Gipper.

387
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
One of these.

388
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
And these nights.

389
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
Oops.

390
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
Should've been using cast glass.

391
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,540
One of these crazy old nights.

392
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,540
We're gonna find one.

393
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,540
One with red screen.

394
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,540
One is mine.

395
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:54,540
One with red screen.

396
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,540
Love it.

397
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
Yeah.

398
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,540
The Eagles.

399
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Answer number one.

400
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
And this is answer number two.

401
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,540
The Eagles.

402
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,540
Don't bring me down.

403
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,540
You got them running all my life.

404
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,540
You got them running all my life.

405
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,540
Everybody!

406
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,540
No, no, no, no, no, no!

407
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,540
Who the weekman!

408
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,540
I tell you what's wrong, big boy,

409
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,540
and get up and go!

410
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,540
Don't repeat it!

411
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,540
I answer number two, the electric lights,

412
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,540
Auguster!

413
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,540
And this is the final answer.

414
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,540
Michael Jackson and Paul McCarty, the girl is mine.

415
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Every night you watch when I'm in the dreams.

416
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,540
Save that she's yours, not mine.

417
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,540
On the Friday evening only one.

418
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,540
Really just a waste of time.

419
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,540
The girl is mine.

420
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,540
The girl is mine.

421
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,540
The girl is mine.

422
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,540
Answer number three.

423
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,540
Well, that's it for this very quick hit test.

424
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,540
Check out the hit test podcast at

425
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,540

And feedback is welcome at hittest at gmail.com.

427
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,540
Well, I don't know how you did well.

428
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,540
See you next time.

429
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
I guess next week for number 44.

430
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,540
Bye-bye.

431
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
Thank you very much.

432
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
Young Bullet bringing you the hit test.

433
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
Very regularly on this podcast.

434
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
The daily source code.

435
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
I love it.

436
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
I just hear no songs.

437
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,540
Really gets me in a great mood.

438
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
Let's see what we can do.

439
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,540
About 40 minutes per week.

440
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
Oh my God.

441
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,540
So tonight we're off.

442
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,540
Around 17 we'll be leaving the cottage.

443
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,540
Christina and her friend Ellie.

444
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,540
We're going to go off to see Weezer at Bricks and Academy.

445
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,540
I decided that I'm just going to drive myself.

446
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
It's only 47 clicks to get there.

447
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,540
Although you drive half of it through the best parts of London.

448
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,540
So I'll take along the I River just in case we decide to do some

449
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,540
signs.

450
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,540
Sound seeing on the way there after the show.

451
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
Just the show will be good.

452
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Just to get some feedback.

453
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,540

Oh man, I'm feeling good.

468
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,540
What a little gym workout can do for you.

469
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:54,540
And in one week from now, I'll be off to the states again.

470
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,540
Got some more beers happening there.

471
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
So that's very exciting.

That would be much appreciated.

475
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Okay, everybody.

476
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,540
I'll be back tomorrow for the Wednesday edition of the daily source code,

477
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,540
which as you know is new music Tuesday, we do it on Wednesdays here.

478
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,540
