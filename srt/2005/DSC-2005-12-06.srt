00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
Good morning, Adam, Darrell's Chanderow here from blindaccessjournal.com.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:15,440
Hey, just listen to DSC number two, nine, or one, and notice the missing introductory

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,640
heading for the podcast and the explanation as to why you may that change.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,640
I sincerely hope that you will change it back.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:33,360
I am a blind podcaster and blind listener, and I really, really, really miss that heading.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,240
Verbaly telling me, as I come to your podcast, what, in fact, it is.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,720
Many of us, myself included, formatted the beginning of our shows,

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:01:02,880
by using DSC as a model, thus the show title and the show number, and really, please,

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:19,600
do not stop that, I'm not able to simply upgrade my eyes to working models, and so upgrading

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,280
from a shuffle from an iPod shuffle to something else would not help a blind listener.

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,600
Also, other reasons, you know, a lot of people listen to these podcasts while

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,200
commuting to work in their cars, wouldn't want to have an accident because somebody was

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,040
messing around with their MP3 player looking at it to see which podcast they're listening to,

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,720
while the same time trying to drive, so a lot of things to consider there, please, please, please,

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,400
do go back to Delta Sierra Charlie, do 9 or 2, and so on and so forth, please, please don't,

16
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,800
don't stop, don't stop doing that, okay, please do us a favor there. Thank you,

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,640
keep up the great work, this is Dale Shandra with blindaxisjournal.com, bye bye.

bride thanks to I was it I forget it was a Darren was a Darrell oh man oh

27
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,760
and I have to go check it again the morning at him Darrell Chandler here

28
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,360
Darrell alright Darrell got a couple more comments about the voice tags pretty

29
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,360
much similar to what you just heard oh no tags it's not about iPod shuffle

30
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
datum it's about not needing to look at the display whether you're in a car or

31
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
just jogging it's much better to hear it like it's great because you can do

32
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,160
something else while getting that information please put the tags back thanks

33
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,080
says grug okay gotcha check mark I just thought I'd change something makes

34
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,280
sound different but now that I think of it it really is kind of important I

35
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,880
guess if you're driving doing other stuff so we had a really good time in

36
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,160
in London we left the early this morning all 10th already that's pretty early

37
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,320
for us to be dressed in out the door outside of need taking Christina to school

38
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,320
of course yeah I get up and I'm ready to go alright no no work needed it was really nice

39
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,440
we took the train to Waterloo Station Patricia and then we hopped in a cab

40
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,320
person went to herids oh man is that place amazing or water Christmas it's just

41
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,680
it's a it's paradise it's beautiful and there's no mad Christmas rush yet I mean I

42
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,160
have not been in London the week before Christmas but it seemed like everyone's kind of

43
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,520
chilling out a lot of stuff was already sold out though people are doing Christmas shopping

44
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,960
early this year in at least at herids then we went over to bond street region street

45
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,840
Oxford street no region street and bond street and new bond street and James street

46
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,480
well we walked all over the place and I really I'm not looking for anything I said hey

47
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,760
if we happen to be in region street we might want to stop in the apple store but somehow Patricia

48
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,360
successfully steered us away from that that of course would be my version of porn man I witnessed

49
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:46,000
a lot of women porn today just uddles of bags and and bling and shoes and of course the new

50
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,560
thing is these high really tight calf you know boots that go around your calf really tight and

51
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,880
and I said to Patricia I said dude this is porn this is just this women's porn this is what it is

52
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,840
it's just amazing all the fragrances and hadn't been in department store with her in a long time

53
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,000
at least not one where I kind of let her loose and just tagged along behind it was nice you know

54
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,720
I had a nice little buzz going so I'm just tripping along and it was really it was pretty cool it was

55
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,000
good to be in the city just good to get out and good to be alone the two of us just Patricia me

56
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,800
and the blackberry yesterday there was news all over the place even the BBC reported about it

57
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,440
about this outfit called the association of independent I think it's musicians they call it aane

58
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,040
which I think is kind of unfortunate because that in my mind is associated with ale instant messenger

59
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,160
um here it is the association of independent music is selling six month worldwide licensed deals

60
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,200
for its members music to be used on download radio programs great guys the headline is

61
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,720
indie music available to podcasts so I've been I've been watching their site diligently up until the

62
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,080
time that I started doing the show today there've been no official announcement on on the aim website

63
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,520
which is indie music dot com but they are really you know I it's it feels a little fishy to me you know

64
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,040
they they pop the news the BBC publishes everything except of course exact details because it will

65
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:20,080
be a four pay license and as the as this BBC story says at least and it will also be a limited time

66
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,080
license so I don't know what that means I mean we have to delete the show after six months how much will

67
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,360
it cost I'm all for for paying to play you know that's absolutely you know problem some of the

68
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,400
artists included our block party stereophonics the white stripes the strokes basement jacks Paul

69
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,320
Weller Arctic Monkeys I recognize at least three of those names Richard Thompson Billy Bragg

70
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,240
so that would be very cool but I I really would like to see the details and I'm a little

71
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,600
disappointed that you know they have this heat going and people were talking about it for a second

72
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,240
there and and there's you know they haven't released the entire license I have a feeling that

73
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,360
maybe someone talked a little bit before they were ready to go to market with it all which uh

74
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,440
it's unfortunate but we'll keep our eye on it um something else happened here um by the way this is

75
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,040
UK organization I should point out it's uh organization of uh UK independent record labels and yesterday

76
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,040
the uh Ricky Jervais podcast launched Ricky Jervais if you don't know who that is he's the boss

77
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:29,040
in the British version of the office and all of a sudden and actually the it kind of been

78
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,280
bubbling under for a while I think what I don't know if he actually he says he's not getting paid for it

79
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:40,320
but it's being launched by the guardian newspaper uh who do lots of uh actually lots of music licensing

80
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,960
deals very often the the UK tabloids the newspapers will include a CD um with golden oldies or

81
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,080
whatever you know they have a two-volume set so you get one on Saturday and you get one on Sunday I think

82
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,320
yeah um and so this uh Ricky Jervais podcast um was uh or as being promoted through the guardian

83
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,760
online guardian.co.uk I was man I was really disappointed first of all I'm a big fan of Ricky Jervais

84
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,040
but when he's doing the writing himself or when he's not writing what he's just talking um your

85
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,280
expectation is very high you know you're like oh this is gonna be great and he's supposedly had

86
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:25,920
two of his I was best friend writer comedians on and um it didn't do anything for me um which is

87
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,840
okay because maybe I have to listen to a couple of episodes and he has to come into his own but

88
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know if you know that he used to do a lot of radio work and it almost sounded like he he just

89
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:42,400
went right back into his BBC radio mode there um so it didn't really compel that much although

90
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,480
they he was very loose and the guys were very loose it you know just kind of talking and shooting

91
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,240
the shit so I did appreciate that but what was disappointing is that Ricky was interviewed um on

92
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,880
ITS I'm on ITV on the afternoon chat show and there were some repeats in the BBC also um

93
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,520
ran a couple of pieces I think during the news and um you know Ricky was sitting there saying well you

94
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,720
know it's so easy even I even I configured out you just to go to a guardian.co.uk and you click and you

95
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,240
listen I was like oh man couldn't someone to brief them a little bit or prepped him just a little just

96
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,560
so it's funny because now the BBC is saying it's the new thing it's podcasting

97
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,400
well the where's the BBC actually were the first mainstream media outlet to jump on the whole idea

98
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,360
and bring it uh to attention of the masses when the culture show I think uh interviewing the

99
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,440
in Belgium we were still at the castle so uh they should have an internal Wikipedia so they know

100
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,640
what they've talked about in the past so Ricky Javez podcasting uh good to have a big name come in

101
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,920
unfortunate that um we couldn't have helped him a little bit with being able to explain what it is

102
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,720
and what the what the real big you know what the real cool things are he did have a lot of it though he

103
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,080
said you know the freedom is great even though he has a lot of freedom with the BBC um but nothing

104
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,000
really about the convenience of it automatically being delivered to your iPod so that was uh that was

105
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,160
too bad but uh I'll give it a I'm subscribed so I'll give it another couple of listens and see if

106
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
if anything cool pops up he just has to kind of slip out of the mainstream mode a little bit

107
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,440
hey uh special little feature here we have the strange accents now on the daily source code

108
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,640
hey Adam this is Boris Kojirski from PositivenessAchishay podcast I'm making a new episode about radio

109
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:38,000
what it was and what it is now I would like you to give an opinion for my listeners what was so

110
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,240
valuable that disappeared and doesn't exist in the radio anymore thanks in advance and best wishes for

111
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,240
all your podcasts whose to part notion of free communication between people yes Boris I will have

112
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,120
the secret code delivered to you or fired a usual means Boris where are you from Ben you sound like

113
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:05,200
you're from Russia Boris well what was it it was so valuable um a good question you big

114
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,600
would he everyone can listen at the same time I think those were valuable things but what we really

115
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,640
lost clearly and people say this all the time but I really do believe in it we lost the passion we lost

116
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,640
the not everywhere not every show not every radio station but I think we in general lost a lot of

117
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,160
passion we forgot so much about what you can do with audio we've it's almost like for a while

118
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,080
there we believe that iPods really only were from music and you know we then we started to find out

119
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,720
you could do other things with your iPod so the same goes with podcasting there's other things

120
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,640
you can do there's other things you can do with audio I hope to show you some of that very soon

121
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,640
we're working on a couple of shows that we're putting together specifically for podcasting that are

122
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:55,360
really not the typical podcast that you would hear working on that with Mark I was your motor

123
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,920
name call I said his name right I shouldn't do that too often feeds his ego way too much so we had

124
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,680
Boris from Russia and then in comes Alex and Alex is from Germany and he's he calls himself

125
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
just a regular listener but he's been doing some pretty pretty interesting work over there

126
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,560
hi Adam this is Alex from Munich Germany and I want to share with you some short insights

127
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,840
on the German podcast listener if you want to I'm doing a podcast so called come you team intro

128
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,440
with focus on podcasting trends and business marketing and communication since beginning of the year

129
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:44,480
which is available on www.pimpmybrain.de but sorry to say that it's only German spoken

130
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,840
last October I did a survey on the German podcast listener to learn a little bit more about their age

131
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,640
the gender family status the so called social demographic data and also to learn about their

132
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:08,240
needs experience regarding podcasts and the use of podcasting in general so now as I mentioned

133
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:15,440
in my mail here's the pot far the summary the 30 year old mail mostly well educated and wealthy

134
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,040
podcast listener looks forward to a 20 minute weekly entertaining and informative podcast

135
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,960
which he's willing to pay for euros for per month or accepts topic related advertising

136
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:37,040
he listens 3.6 hours a week and subscribe to 8 podcasts although there are only 11

137
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,520
percent women listening they listen 20 percent more intensive to podcasts up to the age of 30

138
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:52,960
and 25 percent less intensive above the age of 30 than their mail counterparts so um you can see

139
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,240
we got two very interesting target groups listening to podcasts over here in Germany the one is

140
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,000
male intelligent and the wealthy the others female young and looks for earbird entertaining

141
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,800
sorry to say that there are only 38 percent female singers but 50 percent male but them

142
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,960
that doesn't count anyway I think we are glad about every listener tuning into the

143
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,600
evolution of communication you can I think you can find more details on the results of the survey

144
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:32,240
on my weblog pimpmybrain.de as mentioned and I will provide a link to the English translated results over there

145
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,200
now that's it from Munich thanks for having me on your show and Merry Christmas to everybody out there

146
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:48,480
in the potosphere. Throlic of Inahtin hey did it it's pretty interesting um 38 percent women 30

147
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:56,160
affluent did I hear him say good looking to good looking German chicks oh that's pretty cool I guess

148
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,320
he did the survey amongst just online so it's kind of like an opt-in thing and there's all

149
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,720
bunch of statisticians who will tell you how good that is or not but it sounds about right it certainly

150
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,040
I think there's also how man there's there has to be such a huge Latin market that we haven't

151
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,880
reached yet this uh I'm hearing a couple of countries really bubbling up where podcasting is starting

152
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,960
to work the UK by the way is um I think was a little slower to catch on but um and there may be

153
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,960
less that is for this satisfaction with with the radio here but uh I it's just I get so much

154
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,760
male from UK podcast listeners and and we're thinking of starting a podcast and a lot of it

155
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,600
revolves around music then we have friends I think basically you can say any country um and maybe

156
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:49,760
this is even a part of it think about it both friends um and Canada uh I know have rules about how

157
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,120
much national product has to be played on the radio so I'm talking about music in this case um

158
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,360
and I think that they're quite high so there's not a lot of um not a lot of Britney Spears

159
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,560
or maybe that's the one uh you know the 20% they can play that's foreign and god imagine all

160
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,520
being Britney Spears so I think it's pretty obvious that podcasting will grow rapidly in uh in

161
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,840
countries like that in Germany I don't know if they have commercial um radio stations I somehow I

162
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,480
don't think so they certainly have a lot of big public infrastructure both for television and for

163
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,560
radio so I think that that'll be a country where it uh where it'll definitely start bubbling up and

164
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,320
there was something interesting in your in your survey there um Kurt was it Kurt Alex why does it

165
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,400
Kurt Alex there was something interesting in your uh in your survey where you said that women

166
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,120
listen more intensely and I was thinking about that the other day this you know when someone listens

167
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,280
to a podcast uh let's just say radio versus podcast but I think that when you actually have the

168
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,560
earbuds stuck in your ears and you're thus blocking out all um all external noise I think there's

169
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,400
there is going to be almost an automatic much higher intensity of listening when you're doing

170
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,480
that versus listening in the radio on the speakers now I know a lot of people listen to podcasts either

171
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,280
with uh you know one of those wires that you hook up from your iPod to a Yucacet player lots of

172
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,720
people burn CDs in fact I've kind of gotten the habit of that I'd like it now that I

173
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,280
didn't know that CDs were that cheap they'd got really really cheap I bought a hundred CDs

174
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,800
for nine pounds no boxes just one of those cylinders and so uh you know it I've always

175
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,160
it's always been difficult for me to toss a mouse you know it's like oh well yeah I'll keep it I'll

176
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,920
just store it I'll file it like I'm ever gonna look at it again at least now I've gotten to the habit

177
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:48,240
of writing down with the she's been saying oh writing down with the felt stiff pin exactly what it

178
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,800
is uh that's on the task but I do believe that that intensity it just has to be much much more

179
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:01,680
when you have the shit sticking in your ears which I think uh well what do I think well I don't know

180
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:08,320
what I think it's good I guess it is good so um Germany keep it coming I've seen a lot of

181
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,960
uh German podcasts ping ping dot indie potter dot com to which an indie potter dot org that's kind of

182
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,760
interesting so there is uh there's definitely a German community seeing the French community we have

183
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:26,960
the pom pom pom pom pom pom pom pom podcast and a couple other ones from France and congratulations

184
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,880
to everybody's favorite bloated Jewish angry lesbian Madge Weiss and Weinstein celebrating

185
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,240
her first year of yeast I think it today could have been yesterday if so then I'm sorry Madge the

186
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,080
present came a little bit late but um happy to uh still be able to listen to you every single day

187
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,520
love the aggregator by the way that whole qpotter dot org that the Madge set up is just phenomenal

188
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,280
and the aggregator is a video podcast aggregator that is just phenomenal you know I um through that

189
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,840
I found uh have you ever seen daily planet TV Lucien? I have no idea what is set up is but it's

190
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,400
a daily planet TV dot net and I I watch them religiously as a short video podcast which really works

191
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,280
for me four or five minutes but he has this super super imposed thing going and it's completely

192
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,520
self supported and he's starting video clips and he's showing you um pictures I'd love to know how

193
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,120
I put that together I'm thinking that he does some of that imposed or in post production I'm not sure

194
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,400
but um what he's got going there is very cool is basically a one-man television shop so uh Lucien

195
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:42,160
give it up man what's the secret how does it work and um a lot of talk about Wikipedia so it seems

196
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:49,120
now that after uh several disputes and heated debates over Wikipedia dot org that the rules are

197
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,880
now changing I read actually yeah and I'm not sure what the definitive rules are by now there's so

198
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,240
many uh threads going on about this but I read somewhere that um it is uh I think actually read

199
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,440
on Wikipedia dot org that it is frowned upon to edit your own bio like that doesn't make any sense

200
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,040
I read something in my own bio yesterday which I didn't start on Wikipedia that said that um

201
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,000
I registered MTV dot com in the early days of the web well no that's not true I registered it before

202
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
there was a web there was only go for and I set up the go for server in fact the university of

203
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:31,120
Minnesota um who developed the the go for protocol uh at the time this is a this is an old story

204
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,920
I think I've told this before at the time um they said hey look you know you're using this uh

205
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,440
this mtv dot com that's commercial I said I'm not making any money off it it's only cost some

206
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,400
you money well we still think that you should pay for commercial license which at the time was $5,000

207
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,280
like dude uh uh uh uh first I don't even think I had the money at the time so I don't have five

208
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,480
brand to just spend on a license and you know what am I doing here I'm not using a commercial

209
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,800
manner and so they talked it over and this was really the first time that someone you know outside

210
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,160
of academia had used the go for protocol I guess I guess I can't be too sure but it's certainly

211
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,520
seem like it was new to them and then we finally struck a deal and the somewhere someone has a picture

212
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,880
of this I know it's online we struck a deal that um if I wore a go for a minis you know university

213
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,640
minis sold a go for t-shirt on mtv that they would uh wave the license fee and of course I did it

214
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,440
uh if you have a picture of that that'll be great I'd love to see that again but now it does seem like

215
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,480
the rules are changing another article that someone sent me is that uh one of those two I think

216
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,080
I guess there's two guys who uh who co-founded wikipedia and apparently one of the co-founders has

217
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,880
many many edits uh to his record of editing the history of wikipedia uh at which many points

218
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,560
he's edited his co-founder out and this just brings me to the only thing that uh is really

219
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,000
been on my mind is what is the truth you know the truth is I don't know if there really is a

220
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,240
truth for anything I've I've noticed so many times that um you know even with my wife you know

221
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,960
we'll be talking about something I'll totally believe that that we were talking about the discussion

222
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,880
from one uh point of view a mine of course because I'm the center of my universe and she's the

223
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,360
center of her universe although she's much better at making herself not the center of the universe

224
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,440
um and you know but then you'll find out like oh wait a minute you told it to

225
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,920
understand what I was talking about or or something that'll happen and and I'll recount the events

226
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,560
one way and she'll recount it another way and for her that's the absolute truth and for me it's the

227
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,600
absolute truth you know but there's so much that you don't pay attention to if it's usually

228
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,840
if it's not about you you're not gonna you know notice things is quickly so although I uh I think that

229
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,920
there will be an interesting process that comes out of this I you know just saying this is the

230
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,920
truth and this is the way it is it's a real tough one man it really is so the rules are changing

231
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,160
and uh I guess that proves that for every uh action there's uh there's a complete uh equal and

232
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,640
opposite reactions I guess it was good I think this is all the good thing that maybe we'll figure

233
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,960
out how we make the Wikipedia actually work uh because I do use it often but you know or I used to

234
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,040
use it often and it is a great resource and you know I think in general uh lots of stuff that's in

235
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,240
there is it's pretty much the way it went or the way it was or how it's supposed to be for every one

236
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,280
of the 850 thousand articles but still what is the absolute truth I think that's that's something

237
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:31,920
really hard um I think the really um yeah what is truth I guess uh uh you can only get truth in

238
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:38,320
mathematics then I presume or physics I guess I should have paid more attention in school

239
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,320
hey monk remember him from uh invasion of the pod people well he uh sent something to me

240
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,760
which I'd like to share with you right now I'm pretty sure if it's not in the pod safe music

241
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,640
network well he will be putting it up he says I really like that the pod safe release

242
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,040
Christmas tune but let me give you something to really rock your brain too huh just stocking

243
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
on monk on the daily source code

244
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:39,040
I'm not free till I'm stuck in the door it's up to hanging over me

245
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:50,320
when I like something I can keep got enough socks with my own sheep

246
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:59,360
night night night night's fast red Ferrari if I can't have that guess I'll have to take it

247
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:11,360
by me she's on the way home to bring you read the world I know I can't but I want to see

248
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:29,360
you're stuck in on yeah that's a Christmas gift right there

249
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,880
you hear that? there's damn foxes again I'm telling you it's funny I said that the foxes were

250
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,680
coming closer to civilization last week on the show and I got an email from someone who said

251
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,600
they're not interesting it didn't civilization move into their neck of the woods first

252
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,920
I'm like yeah I guess so but without the excuse me oh man I still have that little bit of the

253
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:59,200
cough Patricia got the cold now she's completely stuffed up without the fox hunts the foxes

254
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,560
fox eye the foxes have just come much closer to us now and they rummage through the garbage man

255
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,160
it's funny though because foxes are really afraid of humans they're afraid of even

256
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,880
dogs and well dogs depends on how big but they're afraid of cats and I think if they can eat

257
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,040
trash they'll eat trash but they eat worms and nuts and stuff like that it's not exactly

258
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,440
what you think of foxes would be into it's not you know foxes do not regularly it's must be

259
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,560
some kind of fable but from everything I've read it's not like the fox gets into the henhouse

260
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,520
and then eats them all up they're afraid of everything everything that jumps and bounces the fox

261
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,320
will run away from um yeah there's anything I can ask on this show and I immediately get

262
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,920
so many cool comments um I talked about oh the crackling fire log that's what it was

263
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,880
and I got a link here let me see it's uh this is about something called the java log

264
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:07,040
coffee based log burns cleaner but no Starbucks smell so apparently uh there is a biofriendly

265
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:14,560
log the java log that is made of primarily coffee beans and produces 85% less carbon monoxide

266
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,840
okay that's not a big deal I mean that'll kill ya but only if you have the windows closed

267
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,920
last year and within 2 million java logs were sold okay I haven't found a place to buy them

268
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,320
over here in the UK but I'll definitely have a look around I'll try it up just to clarify something

269
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,880
I you know not we bought the curry cruiser people are saying that you know I pretended to be a

270
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,480
greenie and I turned out it turns out I'm not well I'm not really the biodiesel thing is just an

271
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,200
experiment I'd really like to try hey it is kind of catching on by the way this biodiesel thing

272
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,280
I'm here in all kinds of you know good good noise from all over the world Volkswagen

273
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,160
their next cars will all be certified to run on biodiesel albeit only 5% biodiesel but still they'll

274
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:11,440
run on it there's been some reports of more efficient ways to create biodiesel efficiency of

275
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,880
10 to 15% or times 10 or 15 times more efficient in the production of biodiesel biodiesel fuels

276
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,160
so I totally intend on getting and I have a parking space at the condo in San Francisco unused

277
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,440
so if if you're in San Francisco and you have a diesel I don't care what kind of diesel it is

278
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,040
you know it probably the older the crappier the better I would like to buy it from you if it's

279
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,560
for sale and I'm talking about something that just drives right it's got to be street legal or

280
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:47,200
you know whatever it has to kind of work but I definitely I'm looking for something that we can

281
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,040
just fill up with vegetable oil see how it runs we'll put some big pod show stickers on it yeah

282
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,960
yeah I'll drive that cool and also if you have and here's this is a this is another very serious

283
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,120
request and I know there's lots of graphic designers who listen to this show and maybe

284
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,320
comic-strick blogger could even help with this one you know when Christina got was it was going to

285
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,920
get her tattoo which of course I was against and Patricia said oh well you know let her do whatever

286
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,680
she wants to do it's it's the kids these days I said wow what are you talking about it's a tattoo

287
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:26,160
dude she's 15 so I lost that battle usually I I do pretty well on the field but I said look if you're

288
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,560
going to get one then I'm going to get one and so I've been thinking for a long time about what kind of

289
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,920
tattoo I want to get and I was thinking maybe a combination of like wings you know like pilots

290
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,760
wings and for my for my upper arm right I like my shoulder or my my ample biceps

291
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,120
pilots wings I don't know what you're going in the in the middle though you know so I kind of want

292
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,560
to represent my passions there so flying and then a microphone would be cheesy but maybe something

293
00:32:52,560 --> 00:33:00,240
that represents you know media or free media or podcasting or whatever it is you know if you

294
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,280
haven't even thought let me know because I'm really looking for some designs at this point I'm

295
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,000
completely convinced I'm going to do it I know who I'm going to have do it for me I just I'm looking

296
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,720
for some designs and another fucking controversies unbelievable um what's this did I have

297
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,920
what is this comment hold on a second let me see I had something oops I had something teed up here I'm

298
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,560
not sure if this was in regards to the feed hijacking hold on let's listen hey Adam this is Darrell

299
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:35,440
Fallen over law school podcast calm was listening to your DSC 289 actually stopped this so I could

300
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,920
record this message to you it's now creating a domain name I have my own domain name of course

301
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:49,920
and our seat oh and so this is this was kind of a lead into the to the feed hijacking now here's

302
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,680
what's interesting about this and and I thought it was kind of dying down but it seems like it is

303
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,720
not gone away yet and I know these two guys one guy from the vegan cast and one guy from pod pod

304
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,960
keywords.com I believe both of them started on podcasting pretty early but there's this huge

305
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,920
riff that is that is come up I think mainly because there's a little bit of a lack of understanding

306
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,440
what's happening and how pod key works and how feed caching works and you know and I think we could

307
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,320
probably see the same misunderstanding with feed burner and I know we've seen this misunderstanding with

308
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,560
iTunes where was I just I just did I just hear a podcast or just that was I listening to

309
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,720
was I watching some oh no it was rocket boom that's right Amanda from rocket boom was saying

310
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,920
that iTunes was considering changing the way they deal with RSS feeds I don't know what it means

311
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,320
but I'll definitely try and get some info from from from the campus for you to find out what's going on

312
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,320
and so the I guess it really the heart of the matter here is two issues one

313
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:00,800
that is probably not a good idea to replicate your podcast feed anywhere else that you don't

314
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,840
have control over over the server so in essence that's like creating a Microsoft Word document

315
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,680
but letting someone else make a copy of it and then distribute it even if that's what you agree to it's

316
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,760
still is not a good idea I mean there's a whole bunch of things that can go wrong in the process

317
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,840
and why would you you know why wouldn't you just send that word document directly to someone so

318
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,960
that's the one part is the caching now of course there's a huge marketing opportunity in there

319
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,520
which is I think what what keywords was initially invented for but I don't think there was ever

320
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,560
business model put around it and I've never really been a fan of keywords myself you remember we

321
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,080
had that whole um that whole craze was that with netscape you could buy keywords and you could just

322
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,240
type into your into your browser window instead of a URL you just type maybe that's still works I

323
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,760
wonder if that works with one on a second um let's see let's just take a random keyword the

324
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,400
random keyword would be sex because I'm sure if it has keywords enabled it'll get it and it goes to

325
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:17,360
sxetc.org a website by teens 14's that's fantastic oh my god oh my god okay sex et cetera

326
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,120
so that's I type that in Firefox that's pretty interesting what if I just do

327
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:33,040
what should we do travel that's another general keywords what happens if I I wonder if keywords

328
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,080
travel loss that is where it goes to that's interesting so are there still keywords available

329
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,920
in in browsers well anyway that's where the the pod key I think that I believe the pod key idea

330
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:51,360
came from so there's that issue and then there's really the issue of um was there a

331
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:59,040
ransom a real hijacking you know I guess if it working back from the so many memes in this

332
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,080
hijacking of feed and asking a ransom these are pretty strong words but the meme is definitely

333
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,880
caught and I think that I may be partially to blame because I played an audio comment from the vegan

334
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,720
cast podcaster who who talked about this and now I was sent a file of the David Lawrence show which is

335
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,400
also I think it might be on the radio but certainly a podcast interview with the uh with the I'm

336
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,920
just using their their show names okay uh using I had an interview with the the podcast keyword

337
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:40,000
dude and completely different viewpoint so I think that the controversy will continue for a while

338
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,920
but now I think it's just gotten personal and I think it's uh we should try and focus on the actual

339
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,760
issue which is you know how do we make sure that this stuff um doesn't happen um and the the number one

340
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:01,200
way is to I guess you know before it's way too late is to you know figure out what best way to set

341
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,080
up your feed because your feed really is quite important and so to answer the question for that comment

342
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,040
that was that I started to play just before I got into this whole thing I believe that the really

343
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:17,040
the true way to do it is to register a domain name so that you can change the DNS to any server you

344
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,640
want and then um yeah then basically you have control over your RSS feed um but you'll still need

345
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,960
control over the server that it resides on and you'll need control over the DNS um which is a domain

346
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,840
name issue so really I think if you put those two things together that's we know so it's much better

347
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:43,200
to be uh atomspodcast.com and then I can put anything behind that to be my RSS feed then it's to be

348
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,000
atomspodcast.odio.com more atomspodcast.podshow.com for that matter um now I happen to control the

349
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,200
DNS on pod shows I'm not too worried about it last night we had the um the final episode of I'm a

350
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,440
celebrity get me out of here the UK version and as I predicted as I'd hoped uh Carol Thatcher

351
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,640
mother to the iron a daughter to the iron lady herself um one and it was it was just a really

352
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:19,040
interesting um series to watch I really enjoyed the personalities uh I didn't know any of them really

353
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,280
was great to um kind of get to know Jimmy Osman who I knew as a little Jimmy Osman the long-haired

354
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,320
lover from Liverpool um Sherri a cido one who uh thank you podcast Paul yeah it's said is uh it

355
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,000
couldn't be more cocky you're right I guess and he used to play an East Enders go figure the

356
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,040
show I watch almost religiously uh so Sherri said and Carol were the the three finalists and um it was

357
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,280
I don't know it was you know what it was it was no controversy or I should take controversy

358
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,920
no controversy at all in uh in the show um this series but what there was it was a real um human

359
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,600
mutual respect and um and helpfulness and there was just something really beautiful going on and I'm sure

360
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,280
that the producers of the show were saying you know damn it you know we don't have any any spark

361
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,080
there's nothing going on here no one's fighting no one's angry but uh maybe that's exactly why I was

362
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:17,120
able to look to really watch the whole thing was just good and um uh and I think that Carol Thatcher

363
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:23,040
will be uh a very interesting uh new voice on the scene uh because of course now uh should be uh

364
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,640
bustle through the entire media gateway and should be talking to everybody about everything uh and

365
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,200
I think she'll do fine it's just it's wonderful to listen to her just listening to her talk is so nice

366
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,240
um you can tell that she's been in basically and yeah I just had a great upbringing

367
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:46,720
her vocabulary is incredibly expensive and you know she will never answer a question where yes or no

368
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,280
she'll she'll just come out with a whole slew of beautiful words that like oh yeah read the yellow

369
00:40:53,360 --> 00:41:01,200
pages to me Carol please wonderful congratulations speaking of that according to Oxford's new dictionary

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:33,200
it'll show up in the show notes show notes that info of course you can find a link from daily

source code dot com a curry dot com David Bern of the talking heads wrote on his website David

416
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,160
Bern dot com the r i a a a should me a warning based on a previous radio playlist he does a

417
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,440
streaming station online that featured all missiele at all the time the digital millennium copyright

418
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,120
act the mca which was passed by congress 1998 was a hastily thrown together measure in my opinion

419
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,840
which aim to protect the music industry from the impending apocalypse well some parts of the

420
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,400
law seem reasonable other aspects when someone overboard to protect the interest of the industry before

421
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,160
folks even knew what would be developed invented or what half the terms actually meant and this is a

422
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:17,120
really good piece that that I encourage you to read because you're going to see here um what really

423
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,720
this digital millennium copyright act meant at the time and it was if you really read to the

424
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,520
DMCA I hope we can get a link to that in the show notes as well you'll see that all these little

425
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:34,240
stipulations are in there so literally um according to the DMCA which applies to streaming only

426
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:42,320
not to podcasting but to streaming you cannot play more than I believe it's four um tracks by the

427
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:48,960
same artist back to back from the same CD because otherwise people might be ripping it off and

428
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,920
there's a whole bunch of really weird stipulations in there by the way if you know um if you call

429
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,000
the record company and say hey can I get a waiver for that they can issue that you know you can issue

430
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,600
that right over the phone so you don't have to deal with it I think that that happens at some of

431
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,080
the satellite stations certainly on this one that you may be listening to this podcast if you are

432
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:14,480
checking us out on serious satellite stars 103 um stay tuned Pacific Coast hellway is coming

433
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,480
up right after this followed by uh Madge Weinstein with East Radio Don and Drew then we have

434
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,840
attention tech um I don't know if we have PW Fenton on tonight or certainly some McCool

435
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,880
Podsake music after that so those of you listening on serious I will uh see you tomorrow here on

436
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,880
the source code and those of you listen to the podcast here comes the bonus piece this is where

437
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,160
we get to talk a little bit longer so let me just see if there's anything else cool in this um

438
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:56,080
well let's just say here uh you cite Lawrence Lessick's book free culture uh here's something

439
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,080
to come back in the day I use my boombox to tape things off the radio all the time that's how I found

440
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,080
out about music I didn't know about and eventually I not only bought those records but ended

441
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,800
up promoting them too which made a fair amount of money for some record labels but not for me

442
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:16,800
not complaining though so you know read that and then you'll see how really broken the the DMCA is

443
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,400
and of course the fact that we don't have anything in place for podcasting which I like I really do

444
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:29,040
I'm glad they can't classify I can't figure out what to do with us um and ask God be in my

445
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,240
of very very helpful really like it when it comes to the music licensing because as far as I can tell

446
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,440
so so far really the only performing rights organizations that will allow their the podcasters

447
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:47,200
sorry allow artists to uh to assign um specific licenses for performance uh to individuals or

448
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:58,160
groups and um Mark Zeta sent me an email uh see he's from Australia so what are we had now we've

449
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,320
had Austria friends Germany the Netherlands now we're in Finland we've had uh this is Australia

450
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:10,240
they have uh the APRA which is the Australian equivalent to ask at BMI um he's quoting from the

451
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,360
website when you become a member of the APRA you assign your performing rights in all existing

452
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,800
and future works to us this is the right to perform the work in public and the right to communicate

453
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,440
the work in public when we administer these rights on your behalf this means we enter licensed

454
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,920
agreements for the performance and communication of music and lyrics we monitor the use of music

455
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,640
under these agreements and distribute the royalties we collect the copyright owners whose material

456
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,960
is identified as having being used so Mark feels that that translates to that if you join

457
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,000
APRA your whole performance rights as an artist go to them that that's exactly what it states

458
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:55,120
and it seems to be that uh in Europe uh this is the case as well so um if you're a musician if you're an

459
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,560
artist uh in Europe uh or in Australia the countries that we've been through so far if not check it

460
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:06,160
out your local rights organization if you're a member if what you've done is actually signed your

461
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,800
rights over then I think that yeah I think there's an issue I wonder by the way can you as a

462
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,280
European artist can you just sign up with ask at BMI and won't they collect from in Europe for you

463
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,440
doesn't it is not how it works or could you do it through a US company something's got to give

464
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,720
because you know this isn't the pod save music revolution is not going to make it just

465
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:32,400
based on US music alone we really need music from all over the globe some I picked up for PMN

466
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,320
some totally different kind of like uh early 80s kind of discoy funk vibe

467
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,760
dread days as one's called Love Life

468
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:01,440
if life's a follow with you have life in love for my view if life's a follow with you

469
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,400
every single day I think God for what comes late I really hope with no delay I

470
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,200
this is what I have to say what happened to the love and over good words now I'm seeing

471
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,360
things what I've been never heard before that was long stone I've been a good love

472
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,080
or you want more what you're gonna do when you have a life I hope you don't think that you're

473
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,480
gonna do when the spot will be you're not really you're not I'll be in this pocket

474
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,840
looking alive I want you to fly in the shot to handle this really you're gonna be hard

475
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,320
but I'm not a pocket in that night you know where that mean I'm from the green

476
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,040
and I stay cool when I stop on the same stuff I just want to see

477
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:59,440
if life's a follow with you if life's a follow with you if life's a follow with you

478
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,920
just me way past it I can draw the stars you that turn to some like racing your arms

479
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,320
fill up the warmth of my life when I get away you show you what I'm made of

480
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,120
a cover mystery sweet and a leafy brand new discoveries never buddies to be

481
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,240
because with these other days love is true and they knew how dreams of one day come true

482
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,440
make decisions like it was in the rain to relieve the child from his pain so clear my vision

483
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,640
even in the rain I don't want to be even in my under way around to be a person's in the draw

484
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,800
don't you like the sunshine and the rain moves the memories with the nice toes

485
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,320
that's the scene man that is so so stop calling their phones yeah this is a love man

486
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,760
I'm somewhat glad I'm going back with you every day I'm made

487
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,080
when I said you're here I love me I said true life was a push out my shoves me

488
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,560
