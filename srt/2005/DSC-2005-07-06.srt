1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charley 203

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey everybody, it is the Daily Source Code for July 6, 2005

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The power of the Lord and the Lord

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We are back home, back at the cottage

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And it feels good

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Or CC would say, it's all good home fries

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's Wednesday, and I said six of July, it is a quarter to seven in the evening

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And it's time for a good old fashioned source code

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You know what, it was great seeing my girls again, of course

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I've been away for like two weeks and a day

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Or something like that, some unbelievable amount of time

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Which is pretty much the max, any of us has ever been away

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So I miss both my girls and then there's like a gap of nothing

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm pretty big gap actually

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But then falling up in like a close second is my mixer set up

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's like, oh, it's my microphone, it's my sound, it's my stereo limiter, it's my process

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's cool

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It really does feel good, you know, just have everything

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Or my office has been cleaned up, it's nice and tidy

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I had a pretty interesting trip back, we'll talk about that a couple of minutes

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Actually, I took some notes and even though I'm a bit jet lag and I did fried

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We got some interesting stuff to talk about

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That welcomed me a couple of new podcasts and the pod show family

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I got a pod safe tune, a really good one for a day like today in the UK

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's one of those dreary days

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's unbelievable, it's your got me all kinds of stuff for the heat

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
As we had a heat wave, and she got me a cooling unit

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And she got me shades, so that the studio slash bedroom 2 would be nice and cool for me

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And now it's like raining in 70 degrees

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Anyway, I dipped into the mashup bin that PW always maintains

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And found a couple of cool ones for it

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This one I like the most, it's good for day like today

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Beatles versus the four tops, this one's produced by Voice Dude

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now it's a quarter to three, what you want to talk about

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
When it's still evening, when it's still evening

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When I was 64, sure the pod running, sure the pod running

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So we didn't let you ask the tune, ask the tune

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You need all that tune

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You need all that tune

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And if you say the word

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Like you say the word

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Like you

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Like you and we met different views

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When your lights have gone

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can get to sweater by the fire side

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Someday morning's gone from a crime

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Knowing the dark, digging the breeze

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't go as before

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
When it's still evening, when it's still evening

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
When I'm 64, sure the pod running, sure the pod running

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So we didn't let you ask the tune

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You need all that tune

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And if you say the word

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Like you and we met different views

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When your lights have gone from a crime

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Knowing the dark, digging the breeze

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't go as before

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So we didn't let you ask the tune

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Girl, let's toss the flame, burn it in my home

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Turn it all up on, no matter how I try

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
My love, I can't help, I can't help

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Tell me your postcard, drop me a line

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Stay tuned to point to point to point to point

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
In the kitchen, I say what you mean, you say

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're sick to see me, you're wasting a fire

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And if you're outside, we'll never fall

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm forever home, too

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm willing to still meet me, willing to still meet me

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When I'm the sixth year old

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sure the power, whatever

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sure the power, everything that I've spent to

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm willing to still meet me, you're wasting a fire

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And if you're outside, we'll never fall

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But I'm sure the power, whatever

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey, voice dude, I'm liking this

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The title of this mashup, I can't help

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm 64, the Beatles versus the four tops on the daily source code

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Diggin' that, pretty cool

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, so episode 203

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I hope I said 203 at the beginning of the show

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Anyway, it was pretty funny, yes

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So actually we spent fourth of July in Miami

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I flew down from or flew across from Portland

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
After the whole fixed-wing license thing

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, yeah, I made another run

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And so I had a, was it flew in on Saturday night

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So Sunday, Ron, I had a chance to do some whiteboard stuff

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Which isn't whiteboard, but we like a flip over chart

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And we stick it up all over his house

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Which was kind of fun

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And it was still hanging there when I left

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The fourth

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I was invited to come along with them

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
To some friends of theirs

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Who live in coral gables and they live on the golf course

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You walk across that to the built more hotel

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And it was a very much a traditional American fourth of July

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Fireworks display, everyone kind of hanging out laying on the grass

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And the music was turned up and

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Not really synchronized with the fireworks display they had

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But when you hear Ray Charles singing America the beautiful

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And fireworks are going off

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's one of those real American moments

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And you think back to, oh man remember Christina's first fireworks display

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I remember, it's always the same

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's just kind of getting really dark and it's your laying out on the grass

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And the fireworks start

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When I was 12 and you know there was always that girl

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I thought was really cute and you'd run around

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hide behind trees and stuff

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It really worked for me

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But then the next day was the fifth

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And I was scheduled to leave it on a 630 flight

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Virgin Atlantic which is my new airline of choice

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If it all possible

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And if I can take them

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And since my travel had gotten all kind of messed up

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There was no of the choice left then to fly

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well they call it upper deck

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Which is kind of in between business class and first class

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But you've got a sleeper sleeper seat

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And it's whatever

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, it's just what Virgin has is there

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The top class but man

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The amenities you get with that is it's astounding

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm really digging it you get free limo service to the airport

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And from the airport

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well free of course is baking to the price

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You get something really cool

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Which is in the UK

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's this concept of fast track

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And fast track if you

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That works if you have a certain

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Gold card, mileage cards

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Or if you fly first class with British Airways and Virgin

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And probably one or two others

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know if it works on like American Airlines

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Or other US carriers or foreign carriers

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But you get a pink card

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And then there's a separate line when you go through customs

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And well really there's no line

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Which is the great thing about it

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And it's just astounding

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's like hey if you pay more then you get to bypass everybody

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And the British Air they're not ashamed to have that

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's really quite interesting

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I liked it

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But anyway so Ron and I were actually on the phone

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
With the Chris McIntyre and his lovely wife

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Ain't the other of me but she sounds great

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They live in Nashville which is really sweet voice

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And we were having a phone conversation

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I'm like Ron you know I got to go now

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And so it was a 515

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We walked out of his apartment

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We said to get the car and drive to the airport

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know we were going fast

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I rushed into the airport

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And they say Mr. Curry

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I said yeah

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh we closed the flight five minutes ago

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But we said we wait for you know

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I see if you showed up so I was like whoa

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And then I got expedited

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is really cool

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Expedited through the security check

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Which kind of makes up for all the times

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I've had everything but a cavity search

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
From TSA

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And Pascal took me to the gate

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And it was great

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And you know hopped on

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And it was nice

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was actually able to sleep

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But it ever since the flight from Portland to Miami

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Where I fell asleep on the plane

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My head kind of on my hand or something

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh man my whole shoulder and arm hurts

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And my neck hurts

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Anyway

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's enough complain

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But version Atlantic

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Very cool

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Dougard

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Was anything else though

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I wanted to say about the flight

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It was

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah it was just a

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Stoundingly good service

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I liked it really did

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Plenty of promo stuff to talk about

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What are we at now

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We're at only ten minutes into it

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay, let me hit you with a couple of promos

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And we back will talk some more about some

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Kuran stuff

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Where in the definition of podcasts

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Does it say that podcasts on the speech insistent

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It doesn't

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And that is why there is digital

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In the fear of stuff or digital

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
In the fear of the stranger

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Just like self and all radio

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In the fear of it

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
In another way to gather

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Just like this podcast

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So light and up

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Put some story in your life

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Subscribe to the digital

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
In the fear and spot us

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And teach you pride

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You always have surprises on your birthday

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Did you?

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Go ahead

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Change your life

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hot Joe

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Content that will make you walk the dog

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And kiss your mother

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Cheat in the girl

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You cannot hate me

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
After you start working there

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Because my people will run you down

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And then like two weeks later

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm like, I fucking hate these people

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then like, should you stop

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm like, I'm still gonna hate

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm like, I'm still gonna hate him

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was like, he's working like

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, God, he's gonna taste

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There's a lot of parts

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And if you start a lesson

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Somebody who's Jewish

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I can put you on the phone

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You know, I think they would understand my situation

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
A little better being that it is a bomb

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a bomb

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's totally understandable

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Thank you

243
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Thank you Maria

244
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And good luck to you

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I know you believe in hell

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm stupid

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And if you're a vegan right now

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're banned from the show

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's stupid

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, I'm serious

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because we make this with butter

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm upset

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I'm something

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And I must have thought

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It really doesn't make much sense

257
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I got no

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Stay manning

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think they realized

260
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There's really no point

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And I'm fired

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You got fired for being pretty

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't like to look at it that way

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, right on

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You know, I've been talking so much about the bandwidth

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And she's me

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh my goodness

270
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Excuse me

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You know what happened there, right?

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I wasn't a sensational thing

273
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Actually

274
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I've been looking at all kinds of numbers

275
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You know, that outside of bandwidth

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We've just gotten so so many listeners

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And subscribers to our shows

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's unreal what's been going on

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Since the launch of iTunes

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I also looked at my Amazon

281
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Associate stats

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You know, I've had this

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And say a machine on the

284
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
On the show notes for a while on the

285
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Create.com homepage

286
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And while I do get some unbelievable

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Percentage like seven

288
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And a half percent commission on

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Every sense say I sell for some reason

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I guess I've sold enough of them

291
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I actually make more money

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
When I put an I river

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have p799 up

294
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I'm going to put that one back up

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Because it's like three times as much

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
As much revenue coming

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And it's unbelievable

298
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It works

299
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can really sell

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Gadgets and stuff

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Through your podcast

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This is what's astounding

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is not huge numbers of money

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But, you know, we're talking

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There was like a couple hundred bucks a month

306
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You know, anywhere from three to six hundred dollars a month

307
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's not too shabby

308
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And, you know, just from

309
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
People showing up and

310
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We're talking about the I river

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And we're talking about senseo

312
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It works

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Something to consider y'all

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hey, one of welcome

315
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The mommy casters

316
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Mommycast.com to the podgeo family

317
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They

318
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, I've played excerpts of

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Mommycast

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And they had explosive growth

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Numbers in subscriptions

322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I feature them on the pod finder pod

323
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Cast in Apple iTunes

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And people are really digging

325
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It turns out that a lot of guys actually listen

326
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Which I guess

327
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I think when I think about it

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Doesn't really surprise me too much

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because I love listening to it

330
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's something I've really a side of parenthood

331
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That you rarely get to hear as a guy

332
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Also, the bitties with a bitty cast

333
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They've been on the road

334
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I think they're just about whining up their ten day tour

335
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And they've been doing great podcast

336
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
From the road with live performances

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Which I love, I love listening to the bitties live

338
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And the quality of the recordings

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I've really just gotten extremely good

340
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So I guess that they're all wide up for it

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So bitty cast also

342
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Now a part of the podgeo family

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And it's

344
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Just go to bitties forever.com

345
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's also bittycast.com

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But I'd like you to see bitties forever

347
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And that's numeral for

348
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Because they can really see what they're all about

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And listen to some of the music

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Which is also actually available in the iTunes music store

351
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I went in there and I purchased

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They're two albums because I had different versions

353
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Of their stuff on MP3

354
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But I really wanted all in one concise go

355
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And you know, it was like 19 bucks or something

356
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Which, by the way, I'm sure get most of

357
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I should ask them about that

358
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think they get a really good deal on iTunes

359
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
All right, your daily source code

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What else do I want to talk about

361
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This

362
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, yeah, of course, London

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Everyone's freaking out here

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Because it was announced that London will be the host city for the 2012 Olympics

365
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And actually got excited

366
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I listened to it live

367
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I was around 12, 45 p.m. here

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And a lot of people thought it might have been Paris

369
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And it could have been Paris

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I thought it wasn't New York in the running at one point

371
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know if they were in the final five or not

372
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But London is just, you know, everyone in the UK is freaking out

373
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They're loving it

374
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Which, yeah, that's really good

375
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Although, you know, when I think about it

376
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's like

377
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
2012 is like seven years away

378
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How excited can I get?

379
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I mean, look what happened with podcasting

380
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In less than a year

381
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Who knows what could it be happened in by 2012

382
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't you just do it

383
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do it that's what I say

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I feel it

385
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I feel it

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I feel it

387
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I feel it

388
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I feel it

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You've been teasing me since I was school

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You've been I am meaningful years

391
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Come on baby, it's cool

392
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Just do it

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh baby, just do

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No more flirting, cross the table

395
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No more hints to say

396
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And then

397
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Better capture the moment

398
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Come on change my mind again

399
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You don't have to make a movement

400
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Come on baby, just do it

401
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Just do it

402
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you really don't want this baby

403
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Just do it

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just do it

405
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Just do it

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Just do it

407
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Just do it

408
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Just do it

409
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Just do it

410
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What are you?

411
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What should show up now?

412
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh

413
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I was just going home

414
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
My baby

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Just put me down

416
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And I don't want to spend the night

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Come on baby

418
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Just do it

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Just do it

420
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Just do it

421
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Just do it

422
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Just do it

423
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Just do it

424
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Just do it

425
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Just do it

426
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Just do it

427
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Just do it

428
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Just do it

429
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Just do it

430
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Just do it

431
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Just do it

432
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Just do it

433
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Just do it

434
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Just do it

435
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Just do it

436
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Just do it

437
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Just do it

438
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Just do it

439
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Just do it

440
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Just do it

441
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Just do it

442
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just do it

443
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Just do it

444
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Just do it

445
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Just do it

446
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Just do it

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Just do it

448
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Just do it

449
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Just do it

450
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Just do it

451
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Just do it

452
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Just do it

453
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Just do it

454
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Just do it

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Just do it

456
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Just do it

457
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Just do it

458
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Just do it

459
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Just do it

460
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Just do it

461
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Just do it

462
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Just do it

463
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Just do it

464
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Such

465
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
To make your dreams come true

466
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I ain't that lucky for you

467
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Just do it

468
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Come on baby, just do it

469
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Come on baby, just do it

470
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Come on baby, just do it

471
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Come on baby, just do it

472
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
For a minute there, I thought it was like

473
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It was a little sound like Johnny Guitar wants you

474
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's Roxie Perry from our back in Bluesville CD

475
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
which was made this year

476
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Do it, it's a Podsake music on the daily source code

477
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
If you're just tuning into Podcast and don't know what Podsake music is all about

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's our router around the music industry

479
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And it's really working

480
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
These are artists who are using the same tools as the signed artists

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Or what would you call them the pros

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You could call them that if you want to

483
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Because they get paid for it, but supposedly that is by record companies

484
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And so they're using the same tool

485
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So, you know, great input, great output

486
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And there's distribution all over the internet

487
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You can buy songs, like the biddies through iTunes

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Or CD Baby or soon through our Podsake music network

489
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And what we've been missing is just the power of radio promotion

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And now we've got artists allowing podcasters to play their tunes on the shows

491
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Which is just phenomenal, it's working

492
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So people are catching on, Rob Costlow's doing great

493
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He's been checking in, he has all of his stuff coming out on a record label

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Pretty soon, I think it's a small record label

495
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So it's good to see all that pullin' together

496
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's exciting stuff, it really is

497
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
As you can tell from how excited I sound

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I was going to say, oh yeah, I was going to say about iTunes

499
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
If you got a promo

500
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Or if you've been thinking about putting a promo together

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Now is a great time because

502
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Every week, I think we're going to kick it off in a week and a half

503
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But in iTunes now there's the pod finder podcast

504
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Which is kind of a weekly overview of new podcast

505
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And what's going on and what people are talking about

506
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And whatever's happening in podcast

507
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And if you got promo send them on over

508
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I just send it all to submit at podshow.com

509
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That's also where you can send stuff for the serious podshow

510
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And for the daily source code as well

511
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So it's just one place, send it all there

512
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So far, I think we've been pretty good to get everything on the air

513
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So send it off

514
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
As I said production cranking up weekly, pretty soon on that

515
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So that's really pretty cool

516
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
In iTunes, I found something amazing

517
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And leave it to Madge Weinstein, my girlfriend

518
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes, don't get all pissed off

519
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Madge is my girlfriend sometimes too

520
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Somehow she got a video to come through on the podcast

521
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Portion of iTunes and there she was making yogurt

522
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So subscribe to EastRadio.com

523
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I guess you can search for it in the podcast

524
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Portion of iTunes

525
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And you can also there are other ways to receive podcast

526
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And they're different we call podcatchers or iPodders

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That have different features that may be very useful

528
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Like iPod or Lemon

529
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I can find that at iPod.sourceforge.net

530
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And I'll make sure there's a link to it

531
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
iPodrex.com for macOSX and there's

532
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh man, in the directory, that's what I'll point to

533
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And in the iPod.org directory

534
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
There's a listing of a whole bunch of different iPodders

535
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And you can also search for it on Google

536
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Different functionality

537
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But I'm digging the iTunes stuff right now

538
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It is working pretty well for me

539
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Although there are still some quirks that I guess we'll have to get around

540
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And for some reason my iPod didn't update properly

541
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's the weirdest thing

542
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So I'm going to keep seeing these pictures on apple.com

543
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We're supposed to have now music, library, library,

544
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Purchase music, party mix, whatever

545
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And then it's just a podcast and that top level

546
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But I have podcast for some reason

547
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
As a playlist in my regular playlist overview

548
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So I don't know what happened

549
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I tried to reinstall the iPod update or something

550
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And it did install and said it was installed

551
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It was up to date current version 2.3 of something

552
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But it doesn't look like the picture

553
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It was basically

554
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Okay

555
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I told Patricia she could come on up

556
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
She should drop by

557
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
People keep asking about her

558
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
She had that

559
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
She's doing something downstairs

560
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I hope she'll come up

561
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Let me see, I've gone over that

562
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We've got a couple more things to talk about

563
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That's a really interesting stuff on the way

564
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Including

565
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Well you'll hear all about it

566
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Stay tuned

567
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Here we go

568
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Come on in

569
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000

Volunteering at the homeless shelter

579

Kissing a girl

580
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Having a life

581
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You are fighting with strangers

582
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Over matters that you have absolutely no control over

583
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
For a slight people die

584
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
No matter if you are a Republican

585
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Democrat

586
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Libertarian or wishy-washy-pensitter

587
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You make sure that your opponent looks like a

588
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Fascist KKK Nazi hate-monger

589
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Or a bleeding heart

590
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Don't smoke a hippy socialist to your buddies

591
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Come by our my law

592
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Without you

593
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
We might actually have cut off our butts

594
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And attended a protest rally or a political convention

595
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
To hear outrageous conspiratorial opinions

596
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Or even heaven forbid

597
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Read the politics section of a newspaper

598
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Turned on AM radio or listen to Bill O'Reilly

599
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
No spins on my ass

600
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So thank you Mr. Internet Politics Debater

601
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000

Would just be

607
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Well skepticism

608
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And for that

609
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Many of us actually go on with our lives

610
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And know that you are out there

611
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000

Podcasting

620
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's a matter of courage

621
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Backtrack's podcast

622
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So you think you know your hits backwards and forwards

623
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah right

624
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You're listening to the Backtrack's podcast

625
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Exclusively on the daily source code with that

626
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm correct

627
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Check this out

628
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
All right Adam

629
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Here's how it works

630
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We bring three hits back from yesterday

631
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And the form of a backwards sample

632
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Then you have three seconds to name each song

633
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Sounds like a familiar format

634
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And you can give yourself a pat on the back

635
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Because you're special

636
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay Adam

637
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Are you ready?

638
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah I'll try

639
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Well let's make the first Backtrack's podcast easy for you

640
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Okay

641
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Here we go

642
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Number one

643
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Oh man

644
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This is very hot

645
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Uh

646
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Time's up

647
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Number two

648
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I know what this one is

649
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
This is a tainted love by softself

650
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That one I could hear

651
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Time's up

652
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Number three

653
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Sounds like a rosanna

654
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
This is a very interesting variant on the hit test by the way

655
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And here's number one

656
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
One last time

657
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh

658
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Jay Giles band free spray

659
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah

660
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's right

661
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's free spray

662
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You're correct

663
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You're correct

664
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And here's number two

665
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah I got this one right

666
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm pretty sure

667
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That's right

668
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's tainted love

669
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And here's number three

670
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
One last time

671
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I thought it was rosanna

672
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Maybe not

673
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh

674
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You built this city

675
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Grace slick Mickey Thomas

676
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Starship

677
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay

678
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I don't know if I like this guy

679
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But this is a podcast

680
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You can subscribe to links to it on the show notes of course

681
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
All right, how did you do Adam?

682
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I sucked

683
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000

Backtrack's podcast

693
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Spin it back

694
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You know what you get when you backtrack a country song?

695
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah you get you to dog back

696
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000

You get your house back

698
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Backtrack

699
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Delta

700
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Ficture

701
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Let's go

702
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Rumio Delta

703
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Rumio

704
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
One second

705
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
When I had just started with mtv.com

706
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
When it was all sanctioned by mtv

707
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Of course at the time

708
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
There was a parody site called mtv

709
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
mptyv.com

710
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And you know kind of like the the the the webmaster there

711
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
As I was for mtv.com was a madam furry

712
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And this was a big hit back in the day

713
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm talking 1993

714
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I think

715
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
In 1993 94 was on a go for server

716
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I think is what it still was back then

717
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I've looked at the internet archive

718
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I've not been able to find that

719
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But with some guy from

720
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It was from university

721
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I was Caltech I want to say I can't quite remember

722
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But it was hilarious

723
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And so this came in this was made in the Netherlands

724
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'll just play a little bit of it because it's actually a whole podcast

725
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's called your daily portfolio

726
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And it's a parody of the daily source code

727
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Of course that's where all the airplanes

728
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Hello

729
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Hey baby

730
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I was just about to play you have to hear this

731
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You know it's about to play a parody of that's Patricia

732
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
My wife for those of you new to the source code

733
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
See it's my wife she's she's growling

734
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh that's my dog I'm sorry

735
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm bringing it's dog not me

736
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Let me see if I can

737
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'll turn the speakers on

738
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay

739
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
This is a parody

740
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000

Something remarkable is happening here

747
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Radio is springing free at the regulated gatekeepers who've managed

748
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
What you can hear since radio is invented

749
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say

750
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass

751
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000

You're DJ

755
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000

And for those who don't know where we're going

758
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Who are going to do who I could do with the capital of F***ing Boocky Dupfoso

759
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh boy

760
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000

761
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000

It's a good thing you might wondering why I sound like shit, you know how it comes.

It just comes from Karl's Blossom and Karl's Blossomike has just done a tremendous job.

770
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,600
You released the best version of Fully Public and that's, you know who it is?

771
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
No, I have no idea.

772
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,800
Is it not that, what's that?

773
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,000
The journalist from the internet.

774
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
Oh, Nikol Dijk's one?

775
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
No, no, I don't think so.

776
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
No, no, I don't think so.

777
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
You want to do the hit test with me, baby?

778
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
First of all, I'm sorry for the echo, but you don't have headphones.

779
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,800
Could you shake your Stevens a little bit?

780
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Shake and Stevens?

781
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,600
The echo?

782
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Yeah.

783
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
What was one of his songs?

784
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,200
What was one of his hits?

785
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Behind the green door.

786
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
On the green door?

787
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Okay, why don't you play hit test?

788
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
Do you want to do the test?

789
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,000
You know that you hit test, right?

790
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Okay.

791
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
Okay, you listen on the speakers.

792
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Oops, did it work?

793
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Could they fuck it up?

794
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Here comes.

795
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,600

Thank you.

797
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600

798
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,600

And if you're ready, we're going to start right away.

00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
This is intro number one.

802
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,000
You know that one?

803
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,200
I know where this is.

804
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,600
No, that's right now.

805
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Each time.

806
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Yeah, it's Madonna's protege.

807
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
What's his name?

808
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Nick Cayman.

809
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600

810
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600

00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Ah.

00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
I know that one.

814
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Yeah.

815
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
I see Yon trying to trip me.

816
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm glad you're here.

817
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,000
And there's always the final one.

818
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This number three.

819
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,400
I don't know what that is.

820
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Okay, time's up.

821
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Okay, number one.

822
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Yeah, I've got another one.

823
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,600
And this is answer number one.

824
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
It's Nick Cayman.

825
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Was not the guy who was in the commercial.

826
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
It was with his jeans, yeah.

827
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
What?

828
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
No.

829
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
I was listening to Yon.

830
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,400
It's Nick Cayman.

831
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,000
Was not the guy who was in the commercial.

832
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It was with his jeans, yeah.

833
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
What?

834
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You didn't hear me.

835
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
No, I was listening to Yon.

836
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What?

837
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,400
I wouldn't care.

838
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Okay, you're next.

839
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,400
That was the robin-evil song, right?

840
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,600
Danger number one.

841
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,400
Nick Cayman.

842
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,600
And this is number two.

843
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
It's a song by the stars, shishishish.

844
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,000
And it's called.

845
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,200
So this is sung by your wife.

846
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,600
Yeah.

847
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Your sister-in-law and a third singer.

848
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I hope you're not into much danger right now.

849
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
The third singer.

850
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
And this is your wife again.

851
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
This is Patricia.

852
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Oh.

853
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,000
How does a good song?

854
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,900
Yeah.

855
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,700
That was good, didn't you?

856
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You should do something with that.

857
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,500
We should do something with that.

858
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,000
What?

859
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What?

860
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,500
What?

861
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,000
That was just about it.

862
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,500
Yeah.

863
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
I don't know.

864
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Yeah.

865
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,000
And it still feels like the first time.

866
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,500
It doesn't appear.

867
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Or two.

868
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
And two.

869
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
And two.

870
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
And now back for sure.

871
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,000
And this is the third and final answer.

872
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The second single.

873
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,500
It's been in a box.

874
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Oh, this is the box.

875
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
No.

876
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Oh.

877
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Oh.

878
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
I don't think we were there when this was a hit.

879
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,500
This one.

880
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I don't remember this.

881
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
I know.

882
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
They've been in a box.

883
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Sorry.

884
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
It was in Condon.

885
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Not with this song.

886
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
No.

887
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Not with this song.

888
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
No way.

889
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,500
No.

890
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
I like it though.

891
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Okay.

892
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Mm-hmm.

893
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I'm trying to hit this number 47.

894
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,000
Living in a box.

895
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
This is blow the house down.

896
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,500
Well, it's great song to end up this hit test.

897
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
I hope you enjoyed this one.

898
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,000
And you got three out of three.

899
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
But I have to wait until you play in the baby short coat.

900
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So I am wondering how it's going to go.

901
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000

I'm not sure.
