1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Deelda Shara charli, 23,4â€¦

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,120
You're DJ...

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,840
Ay you!

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,620
Now continues!

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,580
Your DJ...

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,620
Has only just begun...

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,820
Oh, $16 billion worth of air

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
playing strap to my ass.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,820
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,820
And it is September 2nd, 2005.

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
The thank god it's Friday. It's nip the store's coat.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,820
Everybody, thank you very much.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Bigger all birds for that wonderful thing.

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,820
God it's Friday.

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
Opening takes me back to my radio days from the 80s.

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,820
It is Friday coming to you from the Curry Cottage on September 2nd, 2005.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,820
Your source code with a lot about Hurricane Katrina.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
And some exciting news back here back at home.

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
The bar stool has arrived.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,820
Tom Hickey was over here and see about an hour and a half ago

22
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
from winningsupplies.com.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,820
And brought me this beautiful fire retardant bar stool

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
that is perfect for the Curry Oddcast Complex.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Of course, I'm posting a picture of that on the web wall

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,820
later today.

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,820
And obviously I think to winningsupplies.com and the show notes.

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,820
So I am completely set.

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,820
My feet don't hurt.

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
I got this and say I'm here on the left.

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
And other accrued commands which are important to the show.

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm just looking at the line up.

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
I can already see the show is going to be long.

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,820
It could even be like 45 or 50 minutes long.

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,820
There's so much incoming sound that I want to share with you.

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,820
We have on the scene reports from one of the domes.

37
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,820
I have to get to watch one of his interviews with refugees.

38
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
And we've got many, many PSAs.

39
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,820
And I have a new system set up so that all of these are available for you to download

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
and use in your own podcast.

41
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,820
We're talking about that later.

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Exactly how that works.

43
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
But it should be pretty self-explanatory.

44
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
To start it off, let's see.

45
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Art from mashup town sent over a mashup.

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
He says it didn't think that he'd heard this one on the source code.

47
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,820
But he thinks it's one of the most technically perfect mashups he's ever heard.

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
And I have to agree.

49
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Let's see.

50
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,820
It's Brad Productions.

51
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
Switch of course is brought to you by a mashup town dot car.

52
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
Mashup town records actually.

53
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
There you go.

54
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
It's probably one of the most successful 80s records of all time.

55
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,820
Dreaming in your sleep.

56
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
There's so many feet as close about me.

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,820
You're always playing with depth because we haven't managed to what I've seen.

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
Hey, you bailin' sick of y'all.

59
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
You're deaf and livin' restin' y'all.

60
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
And walkin' on the crooked mouth.

61
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Hey, you're deaf and dumb.

62
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
You're party-parin' living.

63
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
Watch it's equal to you, but careful.

64
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,820
What you give in, Bill.

65
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
You're fever-turning.

66
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
You're shakin' as rich in.

67
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,820
You can start to love a good time for stuff you've been.

68
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Can you feel a little lie?

69
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Can you feel a little lie?

70
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Dream on.

71
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
There's no time for hesitate.

72
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
In vain it's ready, pain is waiting.

73
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
Price do it, check your cadence.

74
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
I'm on it, I'm invited.

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Been a creep beneath the fallen skin.

76
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
It's a list without a lift within you.

77
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,820
There'll be fever-turning, shaking as rich in.

78
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
You can start to love a good time for stuff you've been.

79
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Hey, you're deaf and dumb.

80
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
You're party-parin' living.

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
Watch it's equal to you, but careful.

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
What you give in, Bill.

83
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
You're fever-turning.

84
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,820
You're fever-turning.

85
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,820
Can you feel a little lie?

86
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
Dream on.

87
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,820
How many times would I live at?

88
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,820
I said how many times would it live?

89
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,820
How many times would I live at?

90
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,820
How many times would I live at?

91
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,820
How many times would I live at?

92
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,820
How many times would it live at?

93
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,020
And I'm your colleague, but I'm so shame upon the universe

94
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,420
It knows its lines, it's where we're heard

95
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,420
It's not you and it's dragged you down to where there is no hollow ground

96
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,820
We're holding this, it's never found

97
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,620
And it's not the coming, it's hard, it's hard living

98
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,020
Watch your teeth, I'll kill you, but careful

99
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,820
What's the difference?

100
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,820
There'll be a fever coming, it's shaking, it's twitching

101
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Because you're not sure over, but that's what's up you get through

102
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Can you feel a little love?

103
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Can you feel a little love?

104
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
To be free-more.

105
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,020
Can you feel a little love?

106
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Can you feel a little love?

107
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
To be free-more.

108
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,220
The Brad Productions, mashuptown.com, dreamin' your sleep, mashup here on the Daily

109
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,260
Source code, and before I upload all of the show notes, I will be sure to put in my iTunes,

110
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,660
my brand new iTunes affiliate link to the Romantics, of course, one of the foundations

111
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,580
of that mashup talking in your sleep, because Andrew Makado, who I believe works at eBay,

112
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,260
heard my call the other day when I said, hey, I've been denied an iTunes affiliate status,

113
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,500
and he knew some people, and he started some instant message sessions, and got some email

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
going and loan behold.

115
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I was approved.

116
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I love it.

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,380
Thank you very much, Andrew, and I will do you proud and do you just as my friend.

118
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,060
I'm also going to put in links to the hittest songs, which I haven't been able to do

119
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,700
yet, because of course, I haven't listened to the hittest to keep it a surprise.

120
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
So that's cool.

121
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,340
And I saw that youngpalette actually, a youngpalette.com, started putting iTunes affiliate links

122
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,420
back into his weblog, and I saw you already sold seven.

123
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,740
So it's getting somewhere, it's doing something, it's doing some good.

124
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,780
So I'll be sure to put in links, iTunes affiliate links, to all the songs played in mashups

125
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,780
and hittest, etc.

126
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,540
Again, Andrew Makado, my man, thank you very much.

127
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,540
So the new bar stool, how can I describe this thing?

128
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,500
You just have to take a look at the picture, which I'll post, not as a part of the show

129
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,180
notes, but as of just on curie.com, it's fabulous.

130
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,220
It is exactly the right height for me.

131
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,900
It would be too low for someone smaller than I am, but of course, they wouldn't have

132
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,940
this monstrous podcast complex, this is height either.

133
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,940
But it's great.

134
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,820
And during the mashup, I was actually sitting there, it's got a nice gas damping system,

135
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,380
so I could bounce up and down a little bit and just kind of, you know, giving us a little air

136
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
cushion ride.

137
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,580
They're very, very nice.

138
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,060
Tom Hickey came over earlier today from winningsupplies.com and installed the bar stool,

139
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,140
which was not a very hard process, of course.

140
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,100
It was nice, nice meeting him, and he is just outside of Guilford.

141
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,500
And if you were looking for a great bar stool, because yes, I was giving this one, then

142
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,060
winningsupplies.com is the place for you.

143
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,100
So I've been playing with Omni Outliner Pro version 3.

144
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,540
And I discovered something new, which I'm pretty high on right now, that you can actually

145
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,340
drag MP3 files or any audio file into the outline and check this.

146
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,300
So you can, so I have next up is the daily download, and then I expanded the outline

147
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,860
and underneath there is a little quick time player.

148
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,820
And I can actually play it right from the outline, I'll give you an example here, warning

149
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
the following show.

150
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,140
So that was played right from the outline, I could actually probably do the entire show

151
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,180
just from this outline.

152
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,860
Unfortunately, when you collapse a node, it resets the sound clip back to the beginning.

153
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,260
If you could queue it up and it would stay that way, and it would actually carry over

154
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,180
that way when you save the file, now that would be the cuts me out.

155
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,180
So it doesn't do that, what it does do is when you export it all to the dynamic HTML version

156
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,100
of the outline, which I linked to at the top of all the show notes, you can actually

157
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,100
click right on links, as you expand the node, you can click right on the link and you can

158
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,420
download the audio file.

159
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,820
So from today, we're going to test this out and see how it works from today, you'll be

160
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,060
able to download all of the promos, mashup, hit test, everything that I have in my outline,

161
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,380
you'll be able to access from the show notes, which I think is a great way to do it.

162
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,340
Also, when I export to OPML, same deal, right, so you can take this OPML file and

163
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,020
parse it and you'll also be able to to grab all of the actual elements used during the

164
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
daily source code.

165
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:53,300
So that I think is it is mighty fine, and I'm just realizing that I did something pretty stupid.

166
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,660
Damn, I wanted to have this piece queued up of the daily download, and I didn't even

167
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:07,100
load it into, I did load it here, but I don't think I queued it up, let me just start

168
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:15,460
this, oh man, I blew it, I really blew it on that hold on, because Chris Rockwell, I'll

169
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,140
make it available for you to download, you said, do you have you got to listen to the

170
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,780
show, Chris Rockwell, who of course does the daily download, did a poopcast experiment,

171
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:32,060
trying to dump off of the second story roof of his house onto a target down below,

172
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,460
and he's afraid of heights, and what was so funny about it, and I listened to the show,

173
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,540
the trisha, of course, walked in, she wanted to admit it, no woman will ever admit they're

174
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,980
fan of the daily download, I don't think, and it was so funny, he was trying to coerce his

175
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:54,020
wife into going down and seeing where the load dropped, and so she basically, I'll just

176
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:00,100
tell you the story, so I'll go downstairs and take a look, and then she doesn't, and then

177
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,660
this is legendary line where Chris says, she just doesn't care about the show, she doesn't

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,740
want to go down and participate, she doesn't care about the show, dude, you're pooping from

179
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,500
the roof, women don't, and don't like that, it's really awesome though, you have to listen to that,

180
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,660
link to from the show notes, of course, at dailysourcecode.com, so Hurricane Katrina, without

181
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:30,580
it out, bad fricking news, and it's very, very hard to get any context of the situation,

182
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,580
I've been to New Orleans many times, and Patricia and I have been there during Marty Graw,

183
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,260
MTV Live, Marty Graw, it's a fantastic time, we were there with Heather Locklear, and I think she

184
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,380
was just with Tommy Lee at the time, and everyone was showing their show and their tits, and even

185
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,180
Patricia, she had a lot of beats, let me tell you, and so it really does hit home for just anyone who

186
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:00,420
was visited there, PW Fenton of digital flotsome did a short special edition of his podcast,

187
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,940
which is just, it gives me goosebumps, or gave me goosebumps when I listened to it. I encourage

188
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,980
you to go listen to that edition of digital flotsome, it'll, I think it really will give you

189
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,340
another perspective, or someone else's perspective on New Orleans, oh man, I've been down there,

190
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,900
I've had some good times in New Orleans, and it's gone, this cleanup could take a really,

191
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:28,340
really long time, and it seems like a lot of the preparation that could have been made was just

192
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:34,340
botched, so I'm sure we'll be talking about this for many, many months, if not years to come,

193
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,420
and the podcasts are jumping into it big time, and I've received so many different

194
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,380
audio files that I just want to play a couple for you, and I'm just going to run through a whole

195
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,180
bunch here because there's some good stuff, and everyone, of course, is pointing to the same thing

196
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,540
to redcross.org, please donate whatever you can. This is Brian, with the special announcement urging

197
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,740
your support for relief efforts to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. My wife and I were married in

198
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,580
the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, and the days that we spent there together are some of the most

199
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,180
memorable and wonderful of our lives. We have great memories of the places we visited,

200
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,060
candle mass on Sunday morning at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral, and so many other wonderful places,

201
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,300
and all of the great food in that city. Also, we have lots of affection for the wonderful

202
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,100
people that we met there who were so kind and helpful to us during our stay, like Jerry and Lee,

203
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,900
from Lake Heralons, and Wendell from Commanders. Of course, right now, the people of New Orleans,

204
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,020
and people throughout the South Coast, are suffering terribly as a result of Hurricane Katrina,

205
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,380
and they need our help. upwards of a million people will be homeless for an indefinite period of time,

206
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,340
weeks, maybe months. So I'm sending this message out to urge you to keep the victims in your prayers

207
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,420
and your thoughts, and also if you can, make a donation. The American Red Cross has already begun

208
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,420
the largest single disaster relief mission in their history. And they're telling us right now that

209
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,260
every donation is critical, and every donation can help no matter how small. I visited their website

210
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:06,500
this morning on the web at www.redcross.org and made my donation and it took about five minutes.

211
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,460
You can also call the 800 number but expect some delays there, but that number is 1-800

212
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:20,180
to help now. If you visit my website at www.nobe.com, that's n-o-e-b-i-e.com,

213
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,420
there'll be a link at the top of the page for Hurricane relief efforts, and links from there to

214
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:30,180
both the Red Cross and the Salvation Army USA website where you can donate. And those are the two

215
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,100
largest organizations leading the relief effort. Please do what you can to help, and thank you in advance

216

225
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,740
recovery from devastating Hurricane Katrina. Hi, this is Steve Gilmore, the Gilmore gang. All of us here

226
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,180
at Podjo and the technology community in Silicon Valley are hoping that you'll find it in your

227
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,780
hearts and minds to support the people of America's Gulf Coast, as they struggle with the devastation

228
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:00,100
of Hurricane Katrina. Whether it's through the Red Cross or online web communities or your

229
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:06,260
local churches, mosques and synagogues, please give them money, time, or just plain hope you can.

230
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:14,180
It all will make a difference. Thanks. Hi Adam, it's Richard. Somebody sent me this audio comment

231
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:25,460
which I think is really, really interesting. So I just woke up, but this is from Dutch TV coverage

232
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:32,580
of the Hurricane Katrina, and it sounds like it's, I haven't been paying attention to the coverage

233
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,660
here in the US actually, but from what I understand, this is probably a lot more accurate and

234
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:47,860
it definitely displays why there's need to give a lot of money to these refugees. Okay,

235
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,260
here it is. Thanks Adam. We got a few, we got to steal from each other so we can say,

236
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:05,300
about it a few hours ago. We're going to dive at each other because I haven't had nothing

237
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:17,700
to walk on.

238
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
I like this.

239
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,980
Ooh!

240
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,940
Ooh!

241
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,500
Can you see one?

242
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
One, two, three.

243
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,360
Wow!

244
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,020

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,200

All the way, away, away.

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,440

Yeah, hey away !

278

Oh no!

279
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
I did it!

280
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640

No, don't give us the guts!

287
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
We're going to know I won't.

288
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
No!

289
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
We've got no man to get out of this just like you!

290
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
But we can't even.

291
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Not about Rowing Come It's not about Rich people, poor people, it's about people.

292
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Nobody wants to hurt anybody in this city, nobody wants to hurt these people who have these businesses.

293
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
There's nobody in charge, the National Guard,

294
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,640
there's the police, there is nobody, somebody needs to contact charge and put organization

295
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,640
and get these people to safety to get them close, the basic things that they need to live

296
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
from day to day.

297
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,640
People are dying, they're dying, babies are dying, they're all dead over there, right?

298
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Not dead in the jail!

299
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,640
People are dying, we still have it out here.

300
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Yeah, it's pretty chilling stuff.

301
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Thank you, Richard Boosting for sending that in.

302
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
I found another podcast.

303
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
I think that came in through email.

304
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,640
The Zip 71101 podcast.

305
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,640
And that's by Ron Stroop.

306
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,640
And he actually went into one of the refugee centers and spoke to a young woman,

307
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,640
which is I think you'll really hear a couple of sides of what's going on right now.

308
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Did you listen to this?

309
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Well, I'll just call it a sound seeing tour.

310
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Okay, I'm excited.

311
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,640
The Hirsch College team now have clearance to talk to people.

312
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,640
And the entire floor, the bottom floor of the Hirsch College team is filled with mattresses,

313
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
people reclining.

314
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,640
There's a couple of TVs here and there.

315
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,640
People are watching TV, sitting in lawn chairs.

316
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
People are bringing in food and clothing.

317
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,640
I talked to one volunteer that told me there's another 200 people coming in on a bus

318
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
and just within the hour.

319
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,640
So I would say estimating from position I'm at now that there are over five or 600 people

320
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
just on the floor.

321
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,640
And many are walking around.

322
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
It is cool in here.

323
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,640
And there are no windows.

324
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,640
And if you want to go to the restroom, of course you have to leave the building,

325
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,640
the facility, not the facility, but the main floor.

326
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,640
And go out to one of the server restaurants.

327
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Volunteers have tables set up and they're working throughout the entire complex.

328
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Bringing in food, clothing, as I mentioned.

329
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Some of the refugees are reading the newspaper.

330
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Others watching television while others are talking.

331
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,640
And just sitting somewhere reclining.

332
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
And there are elderly.

333
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,640
There's a few walkers of wheelchairs.

334
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,640
And from this viewpoint, just about what you're sitting on television.

335
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,640
They need warrants.

336
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Only it's 300 miles away.

337
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
It's three-four.

338
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,640
So there must be people here from Louisiana, Mississippi, as well.

339
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
So we're going down on the floor here.

340
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,640
And we're going to talk to folks to see where they're from and how they're doing.

341
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,640
Okay, what's your first name?

342
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
Tami.

343
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Tami.

344
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Hello, Tami. You're from where New Orleans?

345
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
New Orleans.

346
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Same for North Paris.

347
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Okay.

348
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
And can you tell me how long you've been here?

349
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,640
This is going to be my third nice sleep in here.

350
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Okay.

351
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
And have they been taking care of you?

352
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,640
They've really been taking care of us.

353
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,640
We've got a lot of clothes, lots of food.

354
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
They have a lot.

355
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,640
They have countless available for everybody.

356
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
There's plenty of volunteers.

357
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
There's so much food.

358
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
There's so much hell.

359
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
That's great.

360
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
They even keep on animals here.

361
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Have a dog, go back.

362
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Oh, really?

363
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Have you heard anything about your home?

364
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Everything's on the wall.

365
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Everything's underwater.

366
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Did you live near downtown New Orleans or in that area?

367
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Yeah.

368
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
Oh, I got a new name.

369
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Shall met.

370
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Okay.

371
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Shall met.

372
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
My whole family stayed behind.

373
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Did they?

374
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,640
Have you heard from your family?

375
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
No.

376
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,640
The only person I have with me is my twin brother.

377
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Okay.

378
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
And you guys, how old are you?

379
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
25.

380
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
25.

381
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Okay.

382
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
And your parents?

383
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
They haven't heard.

384
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
They haven't heard.

385
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
They stayed home.

386
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Have you made any attempt to reach them?

387
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Or do they have cell phone?

388
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
It's on work.

389
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
It still phones aren't working.

390
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Okay.

391
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,640
So, you're pretty much at the mercy of whatever happens in the next few days.

392
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Have they said anything about when you'd be able to leave?

393
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
No.

394
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,640
No, they said we could be here for a couple months.

395
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
That's correct.

396
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
That's what I've been hearing.

397
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,640
And the president, I don't know if you've seen the news in the last hour or so.

398
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Right now, in the city of New Orleans, people have already,

399
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,640
the government's already, you sent National Guard troops in.

400
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,640
And there were over something like 23, 24,000 people in the super dome.

401
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,640
And they were back in waiting in my buses and taking them to the Astrid home.

402
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,640
I guess you've heard that.

403
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Some of them have come here.

404
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Some have come here.

405
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Yes.

406
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Okay.

407
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,640
And they had to, you know, give them a shot.

408
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Wasn't that everything first?

409
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
Because it was in contaminated water.

410
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
And the bodies that overflow.

411
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Yeah.

412
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,640
They're telling us over a thousand bodies right now,

413
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,640
that they know a one state trooper told one of my colleagues that.

414
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
I'm really, I was really in the paper.

415
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
They just push the dead bodies.

416
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Right.

417
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
That's right.

418
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
That's right.

419
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
That's right.

420
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Are you a college student?

421
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Yeah.

422
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Okay.

423
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,640
I was going to say school soon, but not anymore.

424
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Okay.

425
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,640
But I also have to rebuild the light here.

426
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Exactly.

427
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
That's what everybody, everybody pretty much is saying.

428
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
We'll find a job in Texas.

429
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,640
And that was in Texas.

430
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Okay.

431
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
I'm free for it.

432
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
This is the third child I've been to.

433
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Oh, really?

434
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Yeah.

435
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Since this half.

436
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Okay.

437
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,640
A lot of people are saying they're going to stay here and find a job and live here.

438
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
I don't have a home to go to.

439
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Did you drive here?

440
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Okay.

441
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
So you have a vehicle?

442
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,640
I don't know if you've heard this, but someone said there was a three-foot shark going

443
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
down to Nal Street.

444
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Oh, no.

445
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,640
And there have been reports of alligators and snakes.

446
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
And so this is a good place to be.

447
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,640
You don't want to be there at this particular time.

448
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,640
I've had, I've had like seven different families.

449
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,640
I already come up to my trying to die.

450
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,640
I actually, um, tomorrow.

451
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,640
This lady came to see me today and told me that she, as she has a turtle.

452
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
And it's got two bedrooms.

453
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,640
And she lights it up and I brought my brother.

454
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
And she's going to go clean it up.

455
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,640
And she's just going to find a job.

456
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Great.

457
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
And so we can get out of here.

458
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
And she's letting bring my doll.

459
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Good.

460
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,640
I've cried a thousand of the tears.

461
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,640
Like I'm, I'm so tired of crying.

462
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,640
It's like, I don't even have a family anymore.

463
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,640
This is the only family in my head.

464
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Get your brother.

465
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,640
And he's, he said, he's, he's so devastated.

466
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640
He's like, he wishes he would just stay at home.

467
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Because he can't take that whole family's call.

468
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
I hope you hear from your family soon.

469
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
I hope so too.

470
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Thank you.

471
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
Thank you.

472
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Hi, this is Michael Butler from the Rockham Roll Geek Show.

473
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,640
I'm here to ask for your assistance on behalf of the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

474
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Now I live in Florida for most of my life.

475
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
And we had hurricanes pretty much every year.

476
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
So we're pretty used to it.

477
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,640
But we never had any hurricanes that were as bad as the one that just recently had in New Orleans.

478
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,640
So do everybody a favor.

479
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Go to redcross.org or call 1-800-HELP now.

480
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,640
You can donate as little as $5.

481
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,640
And your donation will provide 8 such as blanket, shelter, food, and drinking water.

482
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
You know, do your part.

483
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm going to go to PayPal as soon as I finish this message and donate more than $5.

484
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
So I hope you roll too.

485
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Thanks a lot for listening.

486
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Thank you, Michael.

487
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Oh, there you have it.

488
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,640
It's, uh, man.

489
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Shilling, absolutely chilling stuff.

490
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,640
You got a link in the show notes.

491
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,640
In case you can't remember redcross.org.

492
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Pod show, of course, getting involved as possible with everybody putting up redcross

493
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,640
banners and donating funds and doing what we can.

494
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,640
And we really, uh, I'm pretty pissed off at our administration.

495
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,640
I'm, you know, it's too simple to say President Bush.

496
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,640
He's just a PR nightmare in this case.

497
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Really, really fucked that one up.

498
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Um, but our administration, uh, did not do a good job with, uh, with our citizens.

499
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,640
And in this case is the golf course that could be the East Coast.

500
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
It could be the West Coast.

501
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
It could be your coast.

502
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
It could happen to you.

503
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Uh, I think we need to deal with, uh, after after we get the situation stabilized,

504
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,640
which could be weeks, it seems.

505
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,640
And we definitely need to, um, you know, we need some inquisition and all this.

506
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,640
How could this be so ill-prepared when shit.

507
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Every single weather channel and weather person knew what was going to happen.

508
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,640
It was predicted and, uh, the relief came way too slow, uh, way too little way too late.

509
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,640
And, uh, when all of a sudden done, uh, I think there will be, uh,

510
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
what's that?

511
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Uh, car alarm.

512
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,640
When all of a sudden done, uh, someone will have to account for, uh, how this was handled.

513
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Because this is not the way, um, the United States is supposed to work.

514
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Okay, daily source code. How fucking bummed out are you now, huh?

515
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,640
I have a little bit, let's see if we can, uh, kick it up a level here.

516
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Hi, Adam. It's David Gary from Chub Creek.

517
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
We love the daily source code.

518
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Hey, time to kick it.

519
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Did, did you kick it?

520
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Nope.

521
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Did you kick it?

522
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Nope.

523
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Well, can you kick it?

524
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
I wanted you to kick it after I said that.

525
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Okay.

526
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Hi, Adam.

527
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,640
It's David Gary from Chub Creek and we love the daily source code.

528
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Kick it.

529
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Potcho.com makes no claims regarding the quality of its potchoes or the sanity of its producers.

530
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Listen at your own risk.

531
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Hey, man.

532
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Why, it's me, Luis.

533
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,640
Stand back.

534
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Well, we could die like this in children.

535
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,640
You can at least count your blessings to the music as great.

536
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everyone's a critic.

537
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
But Senator Jez is right about one thing.

538
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,640
If you want the best music available from Independent and Pod Safe Artist,

539
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,640
then look no further than Reggie Felicity.

540
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Located at Reggie Felicity.net.

541
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,640
The Reggie Felicity Potcho also features my world view, which is kind of excuse seeing

542
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,640
as I'm an American city boy that somehow found himself stuck in small town rural England.

543
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,640
So come in, kick back and enjoy.

544
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,640
It's more fun than five monkeys in a unicycle.

545
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Well, at least as fun as a unicycle with a flat tire.

546
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,640
I still have to fire that guy.

547
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Reggie Felicity.

548
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
All righty.

549
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
This is your daily source code.

550
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
We're moving into the weekend big weekend.

551
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,640
I turned the big four one this weekend.

552
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,640
And I've got a couple of birthday greetings coming up, which were sent to me,

553
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
which I love to play.

554
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,640
But first time we got all you casting with Adam Curtis.

555
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Come on in, young.

556
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,640
I suppose you think you know what you're using.

557
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
I do.

558
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
What do you hear?

559
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
The artist.

560
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Young bowlet.

561
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,640
Young bowlet.

562
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Hey Adam, here's another hit test.

563
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
This one is sort of a rock and roll version.

564
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
So here we go.

565
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
This is intro number one.

566
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Oh, and I'll try enough to sing along.

567
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Okay.

568
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Oh, what was that?

569
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
Okay.

570
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Over one, I guess.

571
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
And number two.

572
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Oh, man.

573
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,640
It's going to be a typical Friday and Adam sucks so bad.

574
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,640
He swallows.

575
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
And number three.

576
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Okay.

577
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,640
That's a romantic.

578
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
I know that one.

579
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Romantic sort of like about you.

580
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Oh, man.

581
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Haven't done this before in a while.

582
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Let's hear the answers, young.

583
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Let me know.

584
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
And times us.

585
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
This is the core.

586
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
One from 1980.

587
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
That's not the song.

588
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Laundy and Colmy.

589
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
It's from me up.

590
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Call me.

591
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Call me.

592
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Answer number one in today's hit test.

593
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
It's Laundy and Colmy.

594
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,640
And this is answer number two.

595
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
John Cougar, Melanchoun.

596
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Don't run the city's in the car.

597
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
Oh, girls.

598
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Okay.

599
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
In the USA.

600
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,640
Feet of cars.

601
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Cars and drivers go.

602
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Boom.

603
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Bam.

604
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
RCDUFA.

605
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
RCDUFA.

606
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
RCDUFA.

607
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
RCDUFA.

608
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
I know.

609
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Yeah.

610
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
I'll get an in the USA.

611
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
But 86, John Cougar, Melanchoun.

612
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,640
R O C K in the USA.

613
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Hey.

614
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
R O C K in the USA.

615
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
RCDUFA.

616
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
RCDUFA.

617
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
R colder number two in this.

618
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
It's an answer number three in this one.

619
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
The Romantics.

620
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,640
So, in the 90s, well, this is what I like about you.

621
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:38,640
That's what I like about you.

622
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,640
And so, number three, the romantics.

623
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
And that's what I like about you.

624
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,640
Well, I couldn't help myself singing along with the song, but the mic was closed, so there was no problem.

625
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Well, this concludes hit test number 56.

626
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:02,640
You know what to do with hit test at gmail.com and with the young polette.com, J-A-N-P-O-L-I-T, and dot com.

627
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Well, I hope you enjoyed this one.

628
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,640
See you next time for next week for a number 57.

629
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Until then, have a nice weekend.

630
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Bye-bye.

631
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
Thank you very much, young polette.

632
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Man, I didn't do too well.

633
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:22,640
You come through me often, by saying it was, I mean, jungle melancham definitely rock, but the blondie thing threw me off a little bit.

634
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,640
E-mail from Dan Romeras says, I'm a newbie.

635
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
I'm a newbie.

636
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,640
I'm a newbie.

637
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,640
When iTunes 4.9 came out, I was introduced finally to the wonderful world of podcasting.

638
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,640
I want to make a name for myself in podcasting.

639
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
How do I start?

640
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,640
I'm a PC user, boo hiss.

641
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,640
I know I'll have a Mac soon if it kills me.

642
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,640
Well, Dan, why don't you head over to castblaster.com.

643
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
It's perfect for the PC.

644
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
And it'll get you on your way.

645
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,640
It'll get you started recording and your show notes and everything's pretty much baked in right there and pretty soon.

646
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,640
I have a feeling you'll have some extra bits that will be added to castblaster.

647
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Wouldn't it be neat if there was something like a podcast delivery network?

648
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Even neither of that was for free.

649
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
I've coined a new phrase.

650
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
It's called Soundvertizing.

651
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Now, I think it was yesterday that I asked you to stop and look around.

652
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
Look at whatever you see right now.

653
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
It could be a road sign.

654
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
It could be a house.

655
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
It could be some other object.

656
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,640
And whenever you see that object, you're going to remember Senseo.

657
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,640
I just had to pick something, right?

658
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,640
Renato said, I was listening to the daily source code of work when you did the Senseo thing.

659
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
I was looking at my screen.

660
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,640
AS400RPG ILE code.

661
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
If you want to know.

662
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,640
That means I now get even more distracted than ever.

663
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Thanks.

664
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
But it's worth it.

665
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Okay.

666
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,640
And it seemed to work as well for this Sean.

667
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
I'm a teenager.

668
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,640
I'm not going to talk about the teenager conversation.

669
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,640
I try to make a little money over the summer by cutting lawns to help pass the time.

670
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
We're cutting the lawns.

671
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
I listen to podcasts.

672
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Normally, I follow the same pattern when cutting a certain lawn.

673
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,640
I have experienced the same thing as DGA.

674
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,640
I guess that's who sent in the original comment.

675
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
When I get to a certain point when cutting a lawn.

676
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,640
I remember something someone said on an interesting conversation in the podcast.

677
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
When I reached that point, the next time I cut that lawn.

678
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
I feel a little better now than I know that other people have the same problem.

679
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
I don't see it as a problem.

680
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I see it as a fricking feature.

681
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,640
We've discovered something pretty big here.

682
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
Okay.

683
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Time to wrap this up.

684
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,640
I got a couple more sound bits to play for.

685
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
What are we at now?

686
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
I'm not too bad actually.

687
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
36 minutes.

688
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Cool.

689
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
Tomorrow will be my birthday.

690
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,640
September 3rd and I turn 41 and a couple of people were kind enough to send in some birthday greetings.

691
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
Hey, they're Adam.

692
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
It's Howard Greenstein.

693
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
And Barry Carl.

694
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,640
And we're just promoing here to wish you a happy 41th birthday.

695
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,640
We're going to sing you a happy birthday song together.

696
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,640
But then I remember that Barry got all the singing jeans in the family.

697
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Yeah, good idea.

698
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
What a Barry, take it away.

699
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Happy birthday to you.

700
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Happy birthday to you.

701
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Happy birthday Mr. Curry.

702
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
I feel so old.

703
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Happy birthday to you.

704
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Boy, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

705
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,640
Funnyness and sainace and you like the sound of Barry's voice.

706
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Not usually a retaining Marilyn Monroe.

707
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
You should check out the podcast.

708
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,640
Confessions of an indie girl podcast at www.BarryCoral.com.

709
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,640
That's www.b-a-r-i-k-o-r-a-l.

710
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Happy birthday, Adam.

711
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
And bye-bye.

712
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Happy birthday to you.

713
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Happy birthday to you.

714
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,640
Happy birthday to you.

715
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Happy birthday to you.

716
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:19,640
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will.

717
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Stop making your kids do that.

718
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,880
Kayden, Austin, Dorf. Thank you very much, Kayden. That was so sweet of you.

719
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,240
Devin, put you up to it. You're daddy Devin, right?

720
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,200
And there was another bird in your Christina-Heter birthday last week on the 27th.

721
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,000
And I got a little audio snippet from someone called Jude Fan.

722
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,520
Hope this doesn't fill up your Gmail. What didn't

723
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,080
it's only like 22 kilobytes. You'll find out why.

724
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,240
I'm still working on getting them to say podfathers. So your birthday wish maybe a little bit late.

725
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:59,200
But here's the one for Christina. Stop putting your kids up to that.

726
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,080
All right. And then definitely one of my favorite ones that came in.

727
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,760
And that'll do it for today's daily source code when getting to the weekend.

728
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,680
As the biddies also wish me happy birthday greeting for Adam Curry.

729
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:24,320
Happy birthday to you. It's a ski us too.

730
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,760
Happy birthday, Suska. Happy birthday dear Adam.

731
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:40,080
Happy birthday to you. We miss you. Come see us sometime.

732
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,840
Incidentally, at least for the next week or so, all proceeds from our CD sales off of CDbaby.com

733
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,480
will be donated to the American Red Cross to help aid victims of Hurricane Katrina.

734
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,120
CDbaby is also giving up their cut on the CD. So that works out to $11 a desk.

735
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,280
So if you've been holding off and ordering the list of ESPD's CD,

736
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,760
I think that was a pretty good time to do it, don't you?

737
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,840
Live from the van. It's been a cast.

738
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,800
Thank you very much, girls. And happy birthday Suska as we share the same birthday September 3rd.

739
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,160
That's it for the source code for today. Have a great weekend, everybody.

740
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,720
And please put the people in the golf course.

741
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
In the golf course, states and your thoughts and prayers.

742
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,760
And in your pocketbook, whatever you're going to buy this weekend, don't buy it.

743
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,480
Just give that money to the Red Cross, Red Cross, dot org.

744
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,680
Maybe you have a couple beers last. It'll really make a difference.

745
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,800
Alrighty, we're heading into the weekend. I have no idea we're going to do tomorrow, but

746
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,320
just chill out. I usually don't make up the deal of my birthday. Certainly not 41.

747
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,880
Don't it's just nothing to celebrate.

748
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,520
Get no. Remember when your parents were 40 and you thought they were fucking ancient?

749
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:08,400
Now I know. Send off your promos to submit at podshow.com.

750
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,440
If you got audio feedbacks, send it to adamaccurry.com.

751
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,840
Please think about your ID3 tags and the way you name the file.

752
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,920
Make a descriptive, make it so we can really use it.

753
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,120
And I would highly appreciate you not attaching the email, the files of the email.

754
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,160
We'll just stick it up on a server somewhere where I can download it as much easier.

755
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,960
In the show notes for today, which you can find on DavySourceCoat.com and www.curry.com,

756
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,800
click on the link that takes you to the full outline.

757
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,800
And from there, you should be able to download any of the elements that we're used in today's show.

758
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,280
So let me know how that works for you. And if it was useful at all,

759
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,600
it probably will be for a lot of those promos and PSAs for the hurricane release.

760
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,760
And feel free to use them to talk recently.

761
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,800
Have yourself great weekend, as I said before. Thank you very much for subscribing.

762
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
If you're not subscribed to DavySourceCoat.com, thanks for listening everybody. Bye, bye.
