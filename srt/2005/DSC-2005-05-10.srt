1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
It's your daily source code for Tuesday, May 10, 2005.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,640
Well, come to La Paz, oh, we're happy you're here.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,760
We recommend that you stick to your ear.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,440
Something remarkable is happening here.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,960
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,560
radio is invented.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,920
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,440
Your DJ, are you, John McLean?

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,240
Your DJ has only just begun.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,840
$16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,400
The next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,560
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,440
Oh, man, it's so automatic, I don't have to do anything.

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,440
Hey, everybody, welcome to the source code.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
What was that?

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,240
No, no, it's not supposed to work that way.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,840
It's your daily source code coming to you from Curry Cottage and lovely Gilford.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,440
Bit dreary today, actually not as lovely as it could be.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,440
I'm sleepy too, man.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,440
What you get when the wife's not home, going to bed, way too late.

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,440
It's currently about 10 minutes to three.

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,440
Oh, I have my exact 40 minutes to get the show done.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Maybe a little bit shorter until Christina comes home.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Oh, man.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Yeah, telling you, Patricia's on a little business slash personal trip.

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,440
So it's just me and the princess here at the home, which means I'm doing everything.

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,440
I'm doing the washing, the cleaning, cooking.

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,440
Which of course means we had pizza last, right?

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,440
And the weather's not nice, I've been indoors all day.

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
But I got some cool stuff for you.

31
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Once again, everything's lined up in the new software.

32
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Apologies for not making the screenshot available yesterday.

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Actually, let me do a new screenshot as we speak.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
There we go.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Hey, and it kept on playing it perfectly.

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,440
So I'll post that with today's show notes on dailysourcecode.com.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Yeah, it hasn't been very nice at all.

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,440
As I said, it doesn't matter too much because Patricia's off on a trip.

39
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,440
So it gives me a chance to catch up on podcasts that I've been, you know, just keeping

40
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440
to listen to.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Do a lot of, actually, did some work with the Cast Blaster developer.

42
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,440
I'm going to talk about that a little bit later on the show.

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
And, you know, got some promos.

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Lots of great promos, actually.

45
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,440
And keep them coming if you hadn't seen it already on the show notes for submissions

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
for the daily source code.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
And also for the pod show on serious, which would be kicking off this coming Friday, Friday

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,440
the 13th, send it off to submit at podshow.com.

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,440
If you got a podsafe tune, you want to promote your band or your music or whatever.

50
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Send it off to podsafe podshow.com.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,440
And of course, always looking for the mashups.

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,440
And I got a cool one right here.

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,440
It's the princes of universe remix.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Here we are.

55
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,440
We're on to the kids.

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,440
We're the rips, and we're the old, old, old, old, old.

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
We're the old, old, old, old.

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,440
We're the old, old, old, old.

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
We're the old, old, old, old.

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Because we're the old, old, old, old.

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,440
Here we are.

62
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,880
With the princes of the universe

63
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,440
We'll deal with the love

64
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,080
Fight for survival

65
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,680
We've got to be the rulers of your life

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,840
I am the model

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,880
I have been tracking blood of king

68
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,680
And I am the rival

69
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,880
And I can't leave my home

70
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,880
Take me to the future of the world

71
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,760
All to be changed

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,960
Rinses of the universe

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,920
Fight in a tree

74
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,720
Got you running my hand

75
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm here for your love and I make my stand

76
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
We'll deal with the love

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,920
To be princes of the universe

78
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
I'm here for your love and I make my stand

79
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm here for your love and I make my stand

80
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm here for your love

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
People talk about you

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
People say you're a judge

83
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
We'll men and we'll go far

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Trying to move in reach for the star

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,920
With my sword and I get a pass today

86
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,920
For the time

87
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Yeah

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
I know that people talk about me

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
I hear it every day

90
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
But I can run around because I'm right

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,920
For the time

92
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Yeah

93
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Yeah

94
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,920
All right, let's go, let's go

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Come on

96
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Yeah

97
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
This is my one of this my final

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Yeah

99
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,920
We're here for your love and I make my stand

100
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
We'll go far

101
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Here we are

102
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,920
All to be changed

103
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Rinses of the universe

104
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,920
I'm here for your love and I make my stand

105
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
We won't deal with the love

106
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
To be princes of the universe

107
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm here for your love and you make my stand

108
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920

I'm here for your love and I make my stand

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Hey, this is where there was a gash or a rock and we had a brand new podcast so they will through our website

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
gash or rock.net.

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:08,920
If you're a puzzle by punk or curious about country, we're a bander, we're a little bit country, punk or punk country

116
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,920
and I just have to say right now, this probably will be the next big musical way to be the new grunge

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,920
to be the new metal, to be the new hippie camp band.

118
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Yeah, this is it.

119
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
It's a coming thing.

120
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
So please give us a listen.

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
We're a podcast.

122
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,920
It's sponsored by free web town and we appreciate your attention.

123
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Rock all right now.

124
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Do you find yourself up all night looking at inappropriate things on the internet?

125
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
I won't get up.

126
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,920
You need to pour on love.

127
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
You need to pour.

128
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Do you find yourself repeatedly showing up late for work?

129
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
French fries.

130
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Do not make themselves unique to be here.

131
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
One time, every day.

132
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Luckily for you, there is an answer.

133
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
It's the drag me out of bed.

134
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Wake up call from one wisdom and lucky bit radio.

135
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Yeah, who is it?

136
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Get that hell out of bed, you dirty horn.

137
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
That's right.

138
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Wake up calls aren't just for hotel stays anymore.

139
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Now YouTube can get a personalized wake up call from America's top podcasting

140
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
drag queen.

141
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,920
You don't get your fan ass out of bed right now, Mary.

142
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I'm going to come over there and smack you silly.

143
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
It's one wisdom's drag me out of bed.

144
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Wake up call coming soon.

145
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Head over to luckymetsradio.com for more details.

146
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,920
If you wouldn't have sat around on the internet all night looking at the horn,

147
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I wouldn't have to call your sorry ass now.

148
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,920
You've never had a drag queen get you up quite like this.

149
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Check it out over at luckymetsradio.com.

150
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Yeah, that's a promo.

151
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
There's some gentlemen.

152
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
That is a dance of damn promo.

153
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I love that.

154
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,920
I was talking to a reporter today from a Dutch newspaper.

155
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
The actually is a well respected newspaper,

156
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
NSA, Humbles Blot.

157
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Right.

158
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Like, go pick up a copy right now.

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Rather young journalist who called me,

160
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,920
but actually she was referred to me by Father Roderick from the Catholic Insider

161
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Catholicinsider.com.

162
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
So that's why I said, okay, I'll do this.

163
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Actually, I'd swore that that would be my last interview with a Dutch publication

164
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,920
because, well, usually, well, usually whenever you give an interview

165
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,920
anyway, they never get it right.

166
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
We've been through that.

167
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
That's a two-way street.

168
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
It's how I communicate, how it's being received.

169
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
That's not necessarily anybody's fault.

170
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,920
And now that we have podcasts and web blogs,

171
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
it's a lot easier.

172
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Yeah, I usually point journalists to my web blogs.

173
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I'd look here, look here.

174
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
You want to about this.

175
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Check this page out.

176
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Just copy it.

177
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Copy paste.

178
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
It's much easier.

179
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
And then I give them one quote.

180
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
But she said, you know, let's do the daily source code.

181
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
I listened to half of the daily source code.

182
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Well, thank you.

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,920
That's a true representative sample of what I'm doing here.

184
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,920
I said, yeah, I heard all kinds of promos for other podcasts.

185
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I said, yeah, that's exactly what my show was about.

186
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
It's, you know, it's,

187
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
I'm, what's they call it?

188
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
The audio directory.

189
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
There you go.

190
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
The audio directory.

191
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
If I potted out org and then there's the audio version.

192
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
And I really like the promos that you guys are putting together.

193
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
You're collecting these in any other manner.

194
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Then have I played one, have I played it before?

195
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Now they've got mega segue set up.

196
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
And as I said, you heard me make the screenshot.

197
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
So hopefully the screenshot will actually appear on the show notes today.

198
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
This is just so much coming in now.

199
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
So many different podcasts.

200
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
But particularly promos.

201
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
And they're getting really creative.

202
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Really, really fun.

203
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
That I just can't keep track of everything that I've played.

204
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
So mega segue is really I'm enjoying it very much.

205
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Because it keeps track of everything you played.

206
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
You can set a separation.

207
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,920
So basically I say, you know, if I played this yesterday,

208
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
don't play it again.

209
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
And it will, I saw it actually happened today.

210
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
It removed two promos that were automatically scheduled.

211
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Pulled it out, replaced them with different ones from the same promo category.

212
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,920
So really all the work goes in, you know, in ID3 tag.

213
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,920
So I just want to talk about that very briefly.

214
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,920
If you're sending a promo or if you're sending a podsafe music or podcast.

215
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Any MP3 you send to me or if you send a link to it.

216
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Please let's let's all can we all just work together and really do a better job with the ID3 tags.

217
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Because mega segue also outputs a log file.

218
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,920
And it takes the ID3 tags obviously.

219
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
And it actually creates an HTML page.

220
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I haven't created a template yet for it.

221
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,920
So I probably won't be until next week when I have that up and running,

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
which I will do for the for the serious pod show.

223
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,920
So you can see what was played.

224
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,920
You know, the better we do with ID3 tags.

225
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,920
The better it's going to be for basically promoting stuff through your promo.

226
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Because it also saves a heck of a lot of work of going back to.

227
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Okay, so this came in through an email, let me search for it.

228
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Ah, yes, this is the website.

229
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Put it right into the ID3 tags.

230
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,920
You put it into the into the comment field or, you know, whatever.

231
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I mean, it's, yeah, that maybe put it as a part of the album field.

232
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
You know, something like that.

233
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,920
So it will actually show up in the in the log file and in the show notes.

234
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Let's see.

235
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Let's see what I have here.

236
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
A couple of things I wanted to talk about today.

237
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Oh, yeah, well, I was basically working most of the day before that interview on the cast

238
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
cast blaster beta.

239
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Man, this is going to be so cool.

240
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Lots of people are using the cast blaster now.

241
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,920
And actually I received a shockwave file, which I will also put up today.

242
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
It's, it's pretty big.

243
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
It's like 27 megs or something like that.

244
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,920
One of our beta testers who did a screen recording of, you know,

245
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
right after he installed cast blaster that he turned on the recording,

246
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,920
the screen recorder, and he's narrating his way through the entire experience of

247
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,920
basically finding out what this thing does.

248
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
And because, you know, does it come with a manual?

249
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
No.

250
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Well, that would be silly, right?

251
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
So, you know, it's, you see the mouse moving around and he's narrating.

252
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
And it's really cool to see, and I also learned a lot, you know,

253
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,920
to see how someone interacts with a new piece of software.

254
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
And learned a lot from it.

255
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,920
And I was working with Mike, lead development on the cast blaster.

256
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
And we're doing all kinds of stuff.

257
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Now, the next version, of course, will automatically create your podcast.

258
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
And, you know, does all the, everything for you.

259
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
You don't have to do anything.

260
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Just, you know, just like you see now.

261
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
And you'll probably see that shockwave movie.

262
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Again, check, oh, sorry about that.

263
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
The show notes for today's podcast.

264
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,920
What was I saying?

265
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Oh, yeah, you, you basically hit save.

266
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
It'll save a copy on your machine.

267
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,920
And it'll take care of all of the rest, all of it.

268
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Okay.

269
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Let me see.

270
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Haven't talked to my mom.

271
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,920
After her, after her marijuana experience,

272
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,920
which we did talk about yesterday with Dr. Joel,

273
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
who's from the arthritis news and views.

274
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
But something else did come in today,

275
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
which showed up in the promo bin.

276
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Another doctor doing a podcast.

277
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Hi, Adam.

278
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
This is Dr. Alan Rubin.

279
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,920
I wanted to tell you about my new Dr. Rubin's health cast.

Check the website for updates, dm.ucf.edu slash till they podcast.

291
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,920
So last night, as I was listening through all the podcasts I'm in saving up,

292
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I came across a beautiful podcast.

293
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,920
And I'm not sure if I can actually play something from it,

294
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,920
although there's probably in the public domain by now or close to it.

295
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,920
It's the old-time radio vault, and this is, it's at otr.libson.org.

296
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Libson is l, I'm sorry.

297
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Lima, India, Bravo, Shira, Yankee, November.org.

298
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,920
And what this podcast is, is it's old-time radio shows.

299
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,920
And the one that I listened to last night, actually as I was going to bed,

300
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,920
the crapplet, that's the tablet, laptop that I have, took it with me to the bedroom.

301
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,920
And just listen to this, it was the whistle I think is what it was.

302
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
It was a show from 1945.

303
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,920
And it was great writing, fantastic narration, good scary effects, you know,

304
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,920
like in your music that just kind of brings into the mood.

305
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Ooh, this is suspense here.

306
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Excuse me.

307
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Yeah, yeah, had a sense out before I started the show.

308
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,920
And then there's a fantastic acting, and it's about 40 minutes in length.

309
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
And I subscribed to the feed immediately and I'm really looking forward to more of those.

310
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,920
So I think we can learn so much about what can be done with audio in this thing we call podcasting,

311
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,920
whether it's radio or whatever it is.

312
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,920
It's, it's, it's, it's fooling around having a good time with audio.

313
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Do I hear, what is that sound?

314
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Yeah, I see other, the other Mac, the fan is going off.

315
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Nice surprise this morning when I woke up.

316
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Easy net crapped out again.

317
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
God, I hate that.

318
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
It's not actually easy nets fault per se.

319
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,920
But that's the big mega pipe that I have coming into the cottage.

320
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
The four mega bit line.

321
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,920
So it runs through a BT British Telecom least line.

322
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,920
And these fuckers disconnected every single time.

323
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,920
You see, is it actually just reconnected again?

324
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
And it's like, you know, I don't know what's going on.

325
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Maybe, I think what's happening is, you know, they're so not used to this type of

326
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,920
connection because it's called local loop unbundled, which means British telecom,

327
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,920
who is the phone company, essentially doesn't provide anything over that line.

328
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
It's just a copper wire going from A to B.

329
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,920
And they probably there's something like engineer going like, oh, what's the slow,

330
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
both?

331
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
And it just all pulled out of the socket.

332
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,920
It disconnects it again, you know, it's driving me fucking crazy.

333
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,920
And of course, I get pissed off at easy net and they can't help it.

334
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,920
And they're not really, you know, this is an expensive line.

335
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,920
This costs like, you know, I was like, was it four, four, five hundred dollars a month?

336
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
You know, it's a, it's a, it's a real line this company in here.

337
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,920
And it's a, and I said, look, I've got a mission critical business running over this line.

338
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Gosh, darn it.

339
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I got to be uploading the, the pod show to the serious FTP server.

340
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,920
And actually, we'll be, I think I mentioned this yesterday.

341
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,920
We'll actually be releasing at least one hour of kind of a test run of the pod show.

342
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
So you can get an idea of what it's going to be.

343
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,920
But I think you can probably already tell now that the initial, you know,

344
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,920
wave of comments as pass is that, you know, I'm not going to sit there for four hours a day in talk.

345
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Shit.

346
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
That's not what I'm up to.

347
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
This is about promoting podcasting.

348
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,920
And I think that as you see, every single new car come off the assembly line in the United States,

349
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,920
which will have CD AM FM and SAT.

350
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
That's basically their satellite receiver.

351
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,920
There may be a lot of satellite radio listeners who may not have an MP3 player or may have one,

352
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,920
and may not be in the pod casting just yet.

353
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,920
I mean, still a heck of a lot of people who don't know what pod casting is.

354
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
You know, so the study says six million listeners.

355
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Last time I counted this like, was it 350 million Americans?

356
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Something like that.

357
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Pod save music now on the daily source code.

358
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,920
This is instrumental to the, it'll be a change.

359
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,920
It's, uh, bicem particle.

360
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
It's titled Resolve.

361
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
It's like you sit back, close your eyes.

362
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Imagine a white sandy beach.

363
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
You're on the chair.

364
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Lay back, cocktail in your hand.

365
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Some are breathe, floating by.

366
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Like waving your hair.

367
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920

Right on, ipodder.org, submit your podcast. I was going to say something I was thinking

485
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,640
about submissions for, was it promos? I can't remember what it was. Interesting, though,

486
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,280
mobile and bedded device, mobile and bedded developers conference. There you go.

487
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,640
Man, it's good to see that there's podcasters there and you should check it out.

488
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,280
It's actually pretty interesting. They're recording sessions and interviews,

489
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,280
no kinds of stuff there and big shout out to the developers. If we can get some ipodder

490
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,240
like functionality in cell phones and MP3 players, that would be pretty cool. It's just a thought.

491
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,280
Hey, I'll promote it if you send me some specs on something you're doing. I'd love that.

492
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,640
All right, that's more or less it for today. As I said earlier, pretty busy week. We're

493
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,600
still working hard on getting the first pod shows ready, doing a test run about to call in.

494
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,640
It's funny. It's all these radio guys who work over at serious who are responsible for

495
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,720
a lot of the technology and there's big boom and voices everybody.

496
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,120
So I want to call was it Jeremy Savage. I think he used to work at a Philadelphia radio

497
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,120
station. So he's now responsible for receiving files through FTP and then making sure they get

498
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,160
up to the side lights. A lot of technology involved and we want to make this stuff sound

499
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:17,280
that's good as possible. If you take MP3s and you re-record them and compress them sometimes,

500
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,160
well, sometimes it's just like crap. So working on a lot of that and I'm looking forward to

501
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,200
the big launch on Friday, Friday the 13th pod show on serious. Tonight, though, something

502
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,520
even more spectacular, I wish I could do a sound seeing tour of this, but I know she'll never let

503
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,480
me. I will ask. I really will ask Christina, but I'm pretty confident she won't.

504
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,680
Since Patricia's out of town, I said, you know, why don't we go out to dinner tonight? You know,

505
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,120
you can go over, you want you to choose. Of course, you know, what's the choice? It's like,

506
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:56,080
TGI Friday is okay. But why don't you invite Benji? That would be her boyfriend who I haven't

507
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,880
met yet. And so she called me from school earlier and she said, well, can Ellie come with us?

508
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,320
Yeah, of course, Ellie can come with us. Tell her to meet us to meet us there and she said,

509
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,960
can Benji come to? And I said, oh, yeah. So I wish I could do a sound seeing tour of that dinner.

510
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:21,200
I'll just have to store it away in one of the fun memories. So I will report back on that tomorrow,

511
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,880
the first meeting with him, the other man in my daughter's life. God.

512
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,960

And if you want your pod safe music, your mashups, or your promo is played on a daily source code,

514
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:50,960
send it to submit at podshow.com, podsafe at podshow.com, or mashup at podshow.com.

515
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,480
And you can also send your podcasts or I'd rather you send a link to your favorite podcast that

516
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,560
you'd like to play it on the podshow. So you've got four hours to fill five days a week.

517
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,520
As always, daily source code.com is the place to pick up the podcast feed, subscribe

518
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,640
and your iPod or you can click on the link directly for each show. It's where you have the latest

519
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:32,720
show and the archives. And I'll be back tomorrow, same time, same dreary weather, unfortunately.

520
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,720
Looking forward to the weekend, doing some flying and with a wink of matter, weather permitting, of course.

521
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,280
Take care, everybody. I'll see you tomorrow on the source code. Bye, bye.
