00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We don't need noss.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Dinking.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Transmader?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Fantastic.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here's Adam Curry.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't need to talk about it.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We've probably heard of it before.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But if you see me walking around here, please open up your door.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And when the sun comes out, you know I'm gonna shout.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll never feel the way I do.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like I feel with you.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It seems like here's it's been warm like this.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Deep inside my soul.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
From the summer wind comes.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Knowing in there's something I really gotta show.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So let the sunshine get's gonna be fine.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll never feel the way I do.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Like I feel with you.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't be surprised if I want more.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If you need to talk about it fine, let everybody know.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Because we can't hide the way it started or how it's gonna grow.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So let the sun come out, let everybody shout,

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't want to ever feel the way like I feel with you.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
With you.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No more summer time.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No more summer time.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No more summer time.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No more summer time.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No more summer time.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:42,680
I can't believe Jess Smith left out the cowbell.

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,280
No more summertime blues, it is brand new from Jeff Smith, you can find them at the

92
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,560
Podsight Music Network or at the JeffSmith.com, G-E-O-F-F Smith, links of course in the

93
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
show notes.

94
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,560
And thank you very much, Danny Boyle, was in the office in San Francisco and show

95
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,720
enough, lots of stuff there, waiting my arrival, no matter how short it was, dear Podfather.

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Please accept this gift of a drumstick, throw my way by the drummer during the hooting

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,000
the blowfish concert at the Concord Pavilion in 1995.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,040
Surely it won't help your rhythm, it doesn't seem to help mine, but what else should

99
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,480
be done with a single drumstick of the chartered list of nothing, Danny Boyle?

100
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
I just use it, Danny.

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Thank you, man.

102
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Really, really appreciated.

103
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Very nice.

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
10 year old drumstick.

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,800
And then American Classic, 5B.

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code, just arrived from San Francisco a couple

107
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,620
hours ago, Patricia and I unpacked, which usually means I unpack the studio and reinstall

108
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,560
it and then sit around while she unpacks the suitcases and we're both kind of floating

109
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,160
around a good flight and I have to say, man, it's so cold, I can't believe it.

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,520
Oh, it was like 53 degrees outside when we landed.

111
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,080
Oh, not good, not friendly at all, but there is some sunshine now and then and they've

112
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,240
had notoriously shitty weather for the past week or so, but everyone's great, really the

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,720
whole operation was success here where Christina was great to her grandparents, you know,

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:25,120
the 80 year olds with power tools didn't do any structural damage to the, to the, to the

115
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,960
cottage and the animals are all still alive, yeah, it's good.

116
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,800
So we're feeling pretty good and of course I promised to do a show for you and I don't

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
think Patricia's going to be dropping by on this one.

118
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,720
She was really, really just, yeah, a little bit out of it and of course everyone, you

119
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,800
know, there's a lot of talk in the, the house is full, so there's just a lot going on.

120
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,880
We're probably going to collapse a little bit later on, but I did want to get a Charlie

121
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
out to you.

122
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,880
There's a lot of stuff I got to catch up on so much backlog of great phone calls, great audio

123
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
comments.

124
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,640
So since I too am a little bit on the, on the jet laggy side, let me, yeah, just to play a couple

125
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
things for you.

126
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,200
This, this, what I've got lined up for you right here, I've been saving for several days.

127
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,480
You remember we had Malcolm Call from Abu Dhabi?

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,800
Well, Malcolm now recorded a audio comment and sent it in and this is a really interesting

129
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,520
guy and I'm very proud to have him as a listener of the Charlie.

130
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
Is it already too late?

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,840
Can I still resist the sirens on of the cyber collective, the pull of the podosphere?

132
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,880
Well I end the very near future, download castblaster and let FedEx bring me a high

133
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,920
LPR 40.

134
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,360
And if so, why?

135
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,000
How did I get to this decision-making moment?

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,760
For a year I've been a loyal, enthusiastic, but totally passive listener to the Adam Curry

137
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
show.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,720
How did I discover the Charlie?

139
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Probably through something I read on one of the media-related blogs I subscribed to,

140
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,400
write a business team, saffronpost on losscremote.com, a dip from Canyata Cheese on the thought

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:13,160
provoking unmediated.org, maybe a mention by Zeni or Cori on buying.net.

142
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,360
My interest in webcasting in general, video as well as audio became more focused, when

143
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,440
Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital announced the funding of Pod Show Incorporated.

144
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,080
As a media professional, I'm sincerely interested in business models which break new ground.

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,360
With the less, Delta Sierra Charlie was still for me, a one-way experience, a pleasurable,

146
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,680
fascinating daily rendezvous with the Curry's, with comic strip blogger, with Roger

147
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,040
Smalls, with audio comments from Enterprising Antipedeans, from civilized, if defensive,

148
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,840
set the ethical and countless eloquent yanks.

149
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,240
I'm sure many listeners like me look juryate by proxy in virgin upper classes, add them

150
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,760
jets to the condo, and then back to Guilford.

151
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,440
I imagine myself in a cartage of my own in Sari, which would be wonderful since my daughter

152
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,840
will be starting at a sixth form college near Dawking as of September.

153
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,920
Then recently the phone lines were opened, and I entered the call in number under DSC in

154
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,280
the phone book of my Sony Ericsson mobile.

155
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,760
My contribution to the yanks versus the Brits was a spontaneous bit of time wasting at my

156
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,200
desk, where I prefer to remain at lunchtime, outside in Abu Dhabi the noon time temperature

157
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,160
is already in the sticky mid-30s, and yes, it was great fun to hear my piece included

158
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
in DSC 390.

159
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,160
But if I do download cast blaster, if I do commence an audio cast of my own, it will

160
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,640
be because of Friday's show with Patricia.

161
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:53,400
Was it the fickle finger of fate, morphic resonance, ground control to major tom, indeed,

162
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,080
back in 1969 I directed the video.

163
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,600
So I guess it was a sign, and I guess I'd better get cast blaster right now.

164
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,320
In the meantime, to Adam and Patricia, Bob Voyage, Guilter Reiser from Malcolm in Abu

165
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Dhabi.

166
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,640
How cool is that?

167
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:20,000
So I looked it up and showed enough Malcolm was the director of the major tom video for

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,360
David Bowie, and it's hard to find Malcolm Thompson and it was hard to find any information

169
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,240
on him, but now I know what he's doing in Abu Dhabi, and actually there's a fantastic

170
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,360
picture of him on flicker, which so completely fits the voice, and I'm going to post a link

171
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
to that.

172
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,880
He's a consultant from music plus, which is for a satellite outfit in, I guess it's

173
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,440
based on, I think it is based in Abu Dhabi.

174
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,280
Very cool, Malcolm, and we've got to get you a DSC or my friend, there's just so many

175
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,320
times, you could listen to the S, so sing a ways, you know what I mean?

176
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,720
Greetings, I think it's the top toe here from the blood cast, the sign come garden at

177
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,000
the moment, like nearly all proceedings just finished in the background.

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,440
I've got three things, I want to say, number one, night.

179
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,880
So first of all, this is the lovely duct toe, who you probably know from the blood cast,

180
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,160
if you don't know or from the blood cast, you might know her from second life.

181
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,320
She hangs out with cars all the time in a real life as well, and she's got a special

182
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
place in the Charlie.

183
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,640
Well, it's probably not going to appreciate me sharing this information, but both here

184
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,280
and I suffer from night sweats on and off, and it is an up and night mess, and I think

185
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,280
it happens when we're understress or under pressure, but it's horrible, you know, and

186
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,960
I don't have enough sheep to keep changing them, I think you're in testing them for

187
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
water proof sheets.

188
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,320
You know, that's interesting, because ever since I started talking about having night sweats,

189
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,480
there's been an incredible, just an outpouring of people who are saying, yeah, I have that

190
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,920
too, even my partner, Ron, I didn't know this about him, I know a lot about Ron, I had

191
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,560
no idea that he also has night sweats, and he didn't really cop to it right off the

192
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,200
bat, but I could tell by his interest level, I was like, oh, wait a minute, something

193
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
going on here, this seems to be something that happens to a lot of people.

194
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,440
I have to say, and he also used to sleep naked, maybe too much information, but I have

195
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,520
to say ever since I started wearing box of shorts and wife beaters to bed, the night sweats

196
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,360
are a thing of the past, my friends.

197
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,560
The two, if you had your first second life dream yet, I'd have two nights in a row, and

198
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,200
it's quite disturbing, everything is in second life.

199
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Number three?

200
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,120
I have a duck, duck toe.

201
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,800
This is not good, you should not be having dreams from past second life.

202
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,720
I also asked around, as a couple other people, and I don't know many people who have

203
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,560
had second life dreams, and by the way, I haven't really been on second life at all,

204
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,200
except for briefly in the pajama party, so now that I'm back in the time zones are all

205
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,800
shifted, I'll definitely check in again.

206
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,680
Saturday, we actually want to see if we can open up the palace, open up the palace, open

207
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,280
up the casino, have some fun.

208
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:14,960
Oh yeah, I really enjoyed everyone hanging around chatting around the castle, that's

209
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,960
a couple of nights ago, and then the pole dances came, and you know, how do we just think

210
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,280
this something more crazy to do in person life?

211
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,680
Here, anyway, enjoy the show.

212
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
Bye.

213
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,960
Thanks, Doc.

214
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,640
If you've got a voicemail comment, love to hear from you.

215
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:38,200
Two phone numbers in New Jersey, zero as in class, yeah, two zero one, six to five,

216
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,600
six three five seven in London, zero two zero seven six eight one three seven five three,

217
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:52,640
and of course, plenty of voicemails and messages left about Carlos 395 daily source code,

218
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,920
we had some technical difficulties, and I do want to get into this just a little bit.

219
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,480
First of all, I'm delighted so many people seem to enjoy the show, and, you know, it

220
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,000
does seem to be that whenever I get emotional, it doesn't matter which way the emotions

221
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,920
are going, people really like it, and they like it even more when Patricia laughs at me.

222
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,400
Hey, Adam, this is Tristan Tom, comment out of the San Francisco Bay area with regards

223
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,080
to daily source code number 395, and the problems that you were having with your mixer

224
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
and microphone combination.

225
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,840
I think one of the cardinal rules of professionalism is don't call attention to

226
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,200
problems, just continue on as if there's no problem, and most of the listeners probably

227
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,880
wouldn't even notice anyway.

228
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,120
Wow, so there's a lot in that statement right there.

229
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,480
First of all, professional, I mean, what is professional?

230
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,720
I thought we all agreed professional means you get paid for something instead of amateur,

231
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,200
root word, which comes from stems from doing something for love, and I think I'm much

232
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,640
more amateur than I am, professional, but isn't the whole point of podcasting is not

233
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,720
to Matt, well, I guess it's not the point, but isn't the beauty of podcasting often that,

234
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,160
you know, you get it with the warts and all the crap all bundled in it.

235
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,280
I have to say, even though I considered stopping that and starting the recording all over

236
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,840
again many times, I really enjoy the response, and I think the outcome was actually much

237
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,400
better than if we had stopped and started to re-record everything, particularly because

238
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,760
now you hear how Patricia is kept me sane for 20 years, but also please understand that

239
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,120
this was not just, you know, what you were hearing was not what I was hearing, and that

240
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,280
is partially my fault, but it was impossible to communicate because, you know, I have a

241
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,000
certain way of talking to the microphone, it's the same mixer, the same microphone, everything

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,880
was all the same, almost everything was the same, I have to say.

243
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,760
If all of a sudden you have to like step back and you can't pop your keys and you have

244
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,160
to be so self-conscious of stuff, it's very hard to work that way, and so yeah, it may

245
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,160
have sounded professional, quote, professional, but I would have been too preoccupied with

246
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,240
trying to keep the sound sane in my, you know, the stuff that I was hearing.

247
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,920
But getting flustered and frustrated and whining and just killing, it's human, it really

248
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,240
doesn't help, and also you come across as being a baby, but professional, no, when you

249
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
do that.

250
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Human.

251
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Problem with the majority of listeners didn't even notice any problem, and I can

252
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
know.

253
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Yeah, that's not true, man.

254
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,560
This show, if, if I had not said anything, people would have, it would have been exactly

255
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,920
the opposite, it would have been, everyone's focus would have somehow gone to the popping

256
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,440
sounds and all the crapping, crapping out sounds that we had, so I don't think that's

257
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,480
it true, I think people definitely would have noticed, and that would have become a focus

258
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
of attention.

259
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,280
Just stand that you noticed it, because you are a perfectionist and you really pay attention

260
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,960
to that kind of stuff, and even if a few people, let's move, even if you listeners, even

261
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,800
if they did notice, I don't think it's a big deal, I mean, your show sounds great, the

262
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,120
majority of the time, I'm sure people will understand if one or two shows a year aren't

263
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,560
optimal in terms of the quality, the audio quality, but making such a big deal out of it,

264
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,680
getting off-flustered, yelling and screaming, getting worked up, I think that's very

265
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
unforecracked.

266
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,200
It's so exciting and good.

267
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,320
Had you just continued on with the normal show, not called attention to the problem,

268
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,320
I think it would have even been a big deal, nobody would have even noticed, so I mean,

269
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,080
just simply not calling attention to what I think would have been a solution, or I guess

270
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,120
you could have started the show again, you know, the problem started the show again, but

271
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,360
I think you did the wrong thing in terms of getting all worked up about it.

272
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,760
Anyway, just my comments continue on with the great work I love the show, and I will continue

273
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
listening.

274
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,680
This is Tristan from the San Francisco Bay area signing out.

275
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Oh, Tristan.

276
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,920
And by the way, of course, I appreciate the feedback, but here's what happened, and a whole

277
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,520
bunch of technical guys were on to a right away, Cas Blaster Mike sent me an email, he said

278
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,400
that he had to dry off his keyboard from crying, he was laughing so hard, but the power

279
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
supply that I had acquired just wasn't strong enough.

280
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,320
In fact, after I figured out that this indeed was the problem, I felt the power supply

281
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,240
with my hand, it was boiling hot, so what really happened was I never, yeah, I tested it

282
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,960
with two microphones, and both microphones worked, but what I hadn't figured, it affected

283
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,000
into the equation is that Patricia's brand new headphones, because I don't, we didn't

284
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,320
really get to talk about that, but we went to buy headphones because probably the same

285
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,600
issue with the power supply, when she was using the earbuds, it didn't work at all,

286
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
she couldn't hear anything.

287
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,880
That's when we were in the Waldorf Astoria, and we did our show from there on Wednesday,

288
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
last Wednesday.

289
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,240
So, she got these beautiful, what are they Sony's?

290
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
I think they're Sony's.

291
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Yeah.

292
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:55,080
Sony, dynamic stereo headphones, the MDRV600, it's like there's 8 million headphones.

293
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,440
She says, I want that one, I want that one there, and she points to it, and that's what

294
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,760
she wanted, and the $200 headphones, but man, are they good, but the power supply couldn't

295
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,480
drive the amplifier to power both her headphones and my headphones.

296
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,200
Whenever we really started to, whenever it was an over-modulation, when we talked into the

297
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,920
Mikely loudly, or whenever she laughed, which is, I love it when she laughed and to have

298
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,240
everything crap out, the mixer literally would start shutting down, and to add the insult

299
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,960
to injury, I was listening to a whole different mix, I had messed around with so many buttons

300
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,800
trying to figure this out, trying to be professional, trying to not let on that something

301
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,160
was wrong, and trying to fix it while Patricia and I were talking, multitasking, that I

302
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,960
hit some wrong buttons, I was listening to a completely wrong output, and it sounded like

303
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,440
total crap to my ears.

304
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:48,560
Hey, I just got finished listening to the podcast 395, to the whole thing, we had to listen

305
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,840
to you, bitching and moaning about the sound, the sound effects and everything, and you had

306
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,880
to wrong input into your head the whole time, so we had to suffer because you said

307
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
it up front.

308
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,000
Do a little show prep, you don't make us do that, or do I.

309
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,560
I've done so much show prep, but I thought I had it all squared away anyway, we're back

310
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
to the old sound.

311
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,640
Actually, now I'm using these new Patricia headphones, and I'm not sure what the, it all

312
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
sounds great.

313
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,280
Now, it's very hard to make it sound shitty, I hope it's not just the headphones.

314
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:27,200
So I mentioned at the end of yesterday's show that where Earthlink is putting their

315
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,240
money where your mouth is, and we want you to create a great Earthlink commercial that

316
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,200
fits within a podcast, fits within a daily source code, or the podcast if you're liking

317
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,400
actually.

318
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
We've called it the ad challenge, you can find that at adchallenge.podshow.com and

319
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
there's a couple of examples.

320
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,400
You could do a jingle, you could do a commercial, you could do an endorsement, and really

321
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,240
you can do anything you want, you don't necessarily have to have it fit exactly in one

322
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,520
of those three categories, but for all those people who moaned about the Earthlink commercial

323
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,680
now is your shot, and by the way, you can actually win very valuable cash prizes if you

324
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,640
do participate, and if you are a winner, and there will be many winners.

325
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,480
3rd one uses for baby wipes, welcome you to the Daddy Battle.

326
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,560
It's Daddy Panel number two with James B from Face the Music, the Naval Cast.

327
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, I can go ahead and do whatever I want, and since I'm breastfeeding, it's fine.

328
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,360
Petey Love from the Daddy Cast, Love House Radio, Interview with the Stranger, and 17,000

329
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,440
other podcasts, I can't remember the name of it.

330
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Give your kid a poker chip in the middle of the mall.

331
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Yeah, we're playing Texas hold of it tonight, you know.

332
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,680
And we're joined by a new member this week, and that is Ringmaster Gregg from Dancing With

333
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Elephants.

334
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Welcome Gregg.

335
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,280
Well, as I recall, I believe I might have set my palm pilot count it off six weeks

336
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,680
and set my palm pilot with a day.

337
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Okay, that's a total geek out right there.

338
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,120
With your host, did it's great.

339
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,320
On the Daddy Panel, we discuss issues like House and News 2 soon, don't I mean, there's

340
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,680
too much TV, really a bad thing?

341
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,960
How do you reward your kid for good behavior?

342
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,680
I think I threatened more, if I'm not happy, ain't nobody happy.

343
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Find us on the web at 1-0-1-usesforbabywipes.com.

344
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,680
We're also an iTunes, the podcast, music network, and your favorite podcast director.

345
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
God.

346
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,680
I've got to say, man, once again, we had a great trip with Virgin Atlantic.

347
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Those people really got it figured out.

348
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:24,040
I am now apparently a unique customer, and I found this out when I checked in.

349
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:30,060
And what happens is during the flight, even sitting in the lounge, Virgin employees

350
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,820
will come up to me and introduce themselves, and as to anything we can do, and of course,

351
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,620
I was asking for strippers and gotten none of that.

352
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,620
But it was great.

353
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,940
It was so nice once again, just that extra little attention to detail, which is paying

354
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,180
for crying out loud, that I didn't really even feel like bitching about the fact that

355
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,420
we had an older model airplane, or interior at least, so we didn't have the full on-demand

356
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,540
system yet to wait for all the movies to start, which kind of suck.

357
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
Oh, I saw the movie Prime.

358
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,980
Oh, no, I'm sorry, not Prime.

359
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,540
Proof with the Gueneth Paltro.

360
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:12,540
Wow, what a great movie, what a beautiful story, and if you haven't seen that movie, it's

361
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
probably on DVD.

362
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,900
I didn't even heard of it before, so maybe you want straight to video, but you have

363
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
to check this movie out.

364
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,860
If you're into a really good story, Anthony Hopkins also co-stars, it's really only

365
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,500
three main actors, it's all about the story in this case.

366
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,140
As Wednesday, which means we've got the Frank Truth coming up on serious sad light stars

367
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,980
102, Michael Butler, of course, with the Rock and Roll indie cast Gilmore Daily Dawn and

368
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,300
Drew, yeast radio, but first we've got Pacific Coast Hellway standing by for you on serious

369
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,540
stars 102, as our satellite window is closing.

370
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,820
I'll talk to all you guys on the sad light tomorrow on our Thursday show.

371
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:59,460
For those of you here on the podcast, another piece of ketchup I have to do is about

372
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,420
second life and the financial model about inflation.

373
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,940
You remember that we got a little bit of feedback about that from the financial aid podcast,

374
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,340
and here's a follow-up, which we, of course, placed into our 10-foil hat moment.

375
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,540
Hey, Adam, I'm a follow-up to your questions.

376
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,940
Reverseing inflation in the video game's second life is tough, but stopping it is easy.

377
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,900
Linden Labs just needs to stop creating more money than it takes out of circulation.

378
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,380
The biggest sources of inflation are the second life welfare payments every Tuesday,

379
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,420
$500 paid subscribers, $50 free subscribers, and the traffic bonuses where landowners

380
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,300
who have highly traffic sims get additional payouts.

381
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,900
The latter is coming to an end this month, but a second life gets more popular, the welfare

382
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,700
payments will either have to continue causing inflation, or Linden Labs will need to find

383
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,940
a different way to get new players into the game, with a reasonable amount of starting

384
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,500
cash while keeping the economy stable.

385
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,860
Incidentally, you probably don't want Alan Green's ban running the second life economy

386
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,420
or any economy.

387
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,700
Green Green spends 10 years fed chairman, U.S. currency inflated from $3.5 trillion

388
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,860
to $10.2 trillion, over the span of 19 years, a $7 trillion increase.

389
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:08,260
A $1,000 purchase in 1987 would today cost you $1,681.

390
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Put another way, $1.00 at the beginning of Green's spends 10-year would today only be worth

391
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
$59 cents.

392
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,900
Again, some conspiracy theorists and economists believed that the extra $7 trillion he created

393
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,940
had to go somewhere, and that somewhere was the stock market bubble of the late 90s.

394
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,420
The housing bubble now.

395
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,740
The golden freshest metals bubble just starting, and the fossil fuel bubble on the horizon,

396
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,740
which hopefully Trinity will be an answer to.

397
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,660
This is Chris from the Financial Aid podcast with a follow-up on the tinfoil hat moment.

398
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,900
Check us out at financialadepodguest.com.

399
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
Thank you, man.

400
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Appreciate it.

401
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:45,180
Okay, so for those of you who have never heard of second life, it's a virtual world where

402
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:51,140
you can basically chat, but you interact with other people, but you can build things and

403
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,140
create things.

404
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:58,100
Their own currency is called Linden Dollars, after the Linden Corporation who runs this

405
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,380
virtual world, and I got a real problem.

406
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:09,340
Now the Pod Show Palace is on a rented piece of land.

407
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,220
This is about all this about this inflation stuff.

408
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:19,660
And I've only paid one month's rent, and so another month's rent is due today, I believe.

409
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:28,060
But the rent was raised significantly, just with an IAM from Miss Business Week, Miss

410
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,900
Anci Chung, because of inflation within second life.

411
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:39,260
Now what this means is that if I were to actually put, it's like $25, not a huge deal.

412
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,540
So I still put the same US dollars in there, but if I'm using money that I earned within

413
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:55,420
second life, it's worth less than it was a week ago, and I actually have to pay more

414
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,420
for the rent.

415
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
This makes no sense.

416
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,140
First of all, I think I'm getting jacked by Miss Chung Enterprises.

417
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,300
There's no real, yeah, there's a kind of, I don't know what kind of contract there is.

418
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,460
I mean, it's just like, here's this piece of land painting now and you're done.

419
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,020
Now she's raising, raising, raising, raising, this way, if inflation continues, no one will

420
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,060
be able to make any money, because money you want to take out of the game, I'll just

421
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:27,660
call it a game in this instance, and turn it into US currency, you have a huge disadvantage

422
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,940
with these inflation rates.

423
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:36,780
So I'm very bearish on second life, and if this inflation continues, I'm out because

424
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:43,780
it's stupid, and if they really want to work something out, besides having the next

425
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:52,260
generation user interface, what's up, baby, what do you, why, what's funny, I'm, I have

426
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
to laugh.

427
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
Why?

428
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,100
Well, I was just actually walking by, and at could hear you talk about second life.

429
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,780
I explained the inflation, but I explained what it was.

430
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
Yeah.

431
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:11,780
So it's as fucked up as you know, I, there you go, thank you, thank you very much.

432
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:20,980
It is as fucked up, and I said phones, yeah, floating away, floating, floating, floating

433
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
on.

434
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:28,420
And my name is Larry, and I'm a Libra, and I get out of here, and I'm right, fuck you very

435
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:34,740
much, Mr. Adam Kerry, but stupid microphone, it's no need to worry.

436
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:41,940
The AC European correspondent is here, and I am not speaking from my rear.

437
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:48,580
I was living in six EU lens, so it's me, who EU understands.

438
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:57,420
What's up in EU nowadays, it's another EU announcement phase, Bulgaria and Romania are joining,

439
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:05,340
and all EU workers find it disappointing, Bulgaria and Romania come to EU in 2007, but

440
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,860
first to Germany comes soccer heaven, where at the Cup 2006 starts on 9th June, and it

441
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:21,300
could be fun, and not Danish cartoon, cheap airlines in Europe there's a lot, so come to Germany

442
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,260
and enjoy soccer part.

443
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:33,020
Oh, y'all, comic strip blogger everybody, oh, actually I should have done your comic strip.

444
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:42,540
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, if you thought inflation was a reason

445
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,300
to get pissed off at second life, check out this message.

446
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:52,500
Adam, I've just come to a little second life, and it's always a new version of everyone

447
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,260
I've got to download it, we have done, and I just want to go through the release notes,

448
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,500
and on the other changes, the first sentence, the ability to create joins has been removed

449
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:12,020
in the tools, man, you've always talking about the same kind of joins,

450
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,300
to just mean the second lungs to the visual world, as well as the SAC or the Cruisal,

451
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,300
no more second lungs than the potfala.

452
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,180
I didn't know that that was on the toolbar to start with, I still got a couple in my inventory though,

453
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,220
that's for sure.

454
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,620
Yeah, Adam, this is Mike Colin from Cali, I'm a listener slash geek who occasionally works

455
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,340
on install projects, and about a month ago I worked on a thousand plus blanks on install

456
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,740
for two of the major record labels, and so first off, when I trip to get an inside look at the

457
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,180
record business from top to bottom, but at the same time, I got to tell you, I've been in a

458
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,940
lot of different industry offices and record books or pigs, I mean, I've never seen someone

459
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,500
to crap in my life, and the amount of money being spent on crap, man, I was hoping to see

460
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,140
the word podcast somewhere, but no luck, in fact, it was kind of sad to see all the CDs and

461
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,820
old media, no digital players, it was kind of like it was taboo or something.

462
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,900
You know when it comes to these albums being leaked early, I was surprised to see these

463
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,060
record labels. I mean, it was ridiculous in the average office and think stack of CDs being

464
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,700
set to folks way before release. It's crazy, but if you were any of the crew on a little

465
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,900
debriefing on the other street, I saw, let me know and I'll leave my contact info on another

466
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,260
call on Casey Wanda, use this comment. See ya, dickier.

467
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,580
Yo dude, so totally would like you to call on with more intel on what's going on in the mainstream

468
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,660
record companies, I would be very cool.

469
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,980
All right, one last song before I wrap her up for today. And of course, tomorrow will be back

470
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,740
and I'll be awake and a Patricia will drop by in some of all kinds of songs.

471
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,060
Strange Day in Mexico, it's the Clintons.

472
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,420
Is it true that we are nothing more than about to send in that basement?

473
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:17,060
The more that we keep looking at, the harder we are, but the record keeps on spinning,

474
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:24,260
while the volume's right down. And you don't say since the end, falling in and out of life,

475
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:42,980
a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico,

476
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,220
a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico,

477
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,900
a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico,

478
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,580
a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico,

479
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,900
a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico,

480
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,900
a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico,

481
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,940
a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico,

482
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:21,380
a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico, a strange day in Mexico,

483
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:29,800
A strange day and next, a strange day and next

484
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:39,000
As in a strange day and next, a strange day and next

485
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,080
As in a strange day and next, a strange day and next

486
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,480
What is this stuff always happening to me?

487
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,560
A strange day and next, a strange day and next

488
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:00,560
As in a strange day and next, a strange day

489
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:08,240
And next, a strange day and next, a strange day and next

490
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,100
As in a strange day and next, a strange day and next

491
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,980
As in a strange day and next, a strange day and next

492
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:39,240
As in a strange day and next, a strange day and next

493
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:48,060
As in a strange day and next, a strange day and next

494
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:57,960
As in a strange day and next, a strange day and next

495
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,980
All that song is a little bit of cow milk

496
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Time's day and less, you're gonna get some days on day.

497
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
Dude, that's all it needs!

498
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,980
Strings day in Mexico, the Clintons, you can find them on the Podsave Music Network as well, of course.

499
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:38,980
I'll put in links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com and at curie.com, and on the Pod Castle every network, we'll get so close.

500
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Okay, so stuff to do this week.

501
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:50,980
I'll probably be on the phone a lot with San Francisco since we got lots of stuff accomplished in a very short amount of time.

502
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:59,980
And I'm planning on going back in about a week and a half, probably about 10 days or so, and I'll be on playing back to the condo for a little bit longer stay.

503
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:08,980
I'm gonna go visit my mom this week and I'm gonna stay two days trying sneak in a discussion with the doctors, which she doesn't want me to talk to.

504
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Oh, what else? Oh, gonna take the in-laws to see Sanatra, which is the Frank Sanatra show here in London.

505
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,980
I think it's at the palladium, so we'll have a full report on that as well.

506
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,980
And as always, I thank you for sticking with me.

507
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
I'll see you tomorrow.

508
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:46,980
We'll get this podcast and more great ones like it on the Hyperformance Podcast to Livery Network from Podshow and LineWight Networks.

509
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,980
I love it.
