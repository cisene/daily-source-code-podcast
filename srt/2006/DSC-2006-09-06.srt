10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Podcasting is an out-of-curry.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You've got a brand new high school work,

some cool street, every day.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sir, I had a podcast in the show.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is a lot of pain.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Is that the thing when we have parties?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, you know, it's your fault.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've shot my hair, you smell damn sick.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Something that you don't shoot into the door.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You don't get it, I've had.

20

Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's kind of in between all kinds of stuff today.

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Our offer was accepted on the house that we put an offering on.

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's really exciting.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's the first offer we've had that's actually been accepted.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Now we're going through this period of trying to close it all up.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Right now the current owner, she's fine with getting to a close real quickly.

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But she can't tell us when she wants to move.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And it seems that the cottage she was going to move in that was going to be empty.

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That those people have to move out too.

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So guess what we're in a chain?

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

114
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Fantastic.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My lifelong dream fulfilled.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The phone could go at any time.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There's all kinds of activity going on here at the cottage.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And it's warm.

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's really awesome weather.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's like 26 degrees Celsius.

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
27 degrees sun shining.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I wouldn't quite call it an Indian summer yet because I think that has to last for two weeks.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not going to complain.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's for sure.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let me just wrap up a couple of belated birthday greetings that came in.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because it's almost like someone sent you a card that came late and you don't thank him for it.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And because of the whole nature of podcasting people are finding out it was my birthday.

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, significantly after my birthday.

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, almost.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I can't pilot error already.

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, yeah.

132
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Here we go.

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Try this.

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, I didn't carry this.

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's fine from Germany.

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I just wish you a very, very good birthday.

137
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I just found out that we actually share the same birthday.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was born 30 years ago to do this thing.

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I hope you have a great party.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And let's wish it's from Germany.

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And laugh the show older.

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And that's in tail moment.

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Brought to you by Patricia's stew.

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Happy birthday.

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Happy birthday to you.

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Happy birthday to you.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Happy, happy, happy birthday dear Mr. podcast president.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Happy birthday to you.

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wow.

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So Adam did that.

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Good to see you.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Happy birthday.

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And thank you.

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you so much for playing the divas on your last DSC.

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is from the divas at the divacast.com.

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We love you.

157
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We love you.

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you.

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Celebrate well.

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Divacast.com.

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The divacast.com.

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
All right.

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, this party has to end.

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And we're not going to like it on the high performant.

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Damn.

166
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Get naked ladies.

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now I did divas.

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you very much.

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now I, you know, you guys think that maybe I don't hear these shows.

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But when I'm over in England, I have such an advantage with the time.

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm up a way before anyone else in the US.

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And so, you know, and I have a lot more.

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, of course, I spread my day out twice as long because San Francisco wakes up at 4 p.m.

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Our time here.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I'm sometimes can be on the phone until I, you know, 12 30 1 a.m.

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But it gives me a real advantage to just listen to stuff without being disturbed

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
because everyone else in the company, most of them at least are asleep.

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So I did listen to the divacast.

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And I listened to your response to, to my comments on it.

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm just going to say it again.

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right now, you are, you're on kind of on the edge between the view.

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Right?

183
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Which is a bunch of women who are sugarcoding things and not really being honest about their feelings.

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Even if it's contrary to the other view members.

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And you're on, you sometimes step over into something really, really wonderful.

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But you know, there are definitely opposing viewpoints in your group of five divas.

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So let's hear them.

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And if you really, really, really are friends and you want to do this and you want to create something that's more than just

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
clutch, which a lot of it is in my humble opinion, then you've got to dare to go the extra mile.

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You have to, you have to be willing to offend someone else to make a point or to get a conversation going.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And you don't have to purposely offend somebody, but by expressing your own view point,

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
honestly, honestly, and don't, and all this, you know, talking around subjects and using,

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know, please, please, there's so much potential there.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Be honest, if you really are friends, you can have a fight.

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can have real words and then walk away and be friends.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It really, if you are friends, it will work.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And otherwise, it's just kind of like the view.

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But I do appreciate the happy birthday greetings.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you very much.

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now, if you want to hear a great promo or creative promo, something that just really caught my attention,

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think you're like this one.

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Well, quality podcasting with killer music and commentary straight from the middle of America,

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
then listen to my dad's show.

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's called Worlds of Wayne, and it's freaking great.

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Worlds of Wayne.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Hey, hey, hey, did you just say the effort?

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, oh, no, I said great.

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, I mean, before that.

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, it's okay.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I said it with the tone.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Like this son of a...

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, okay.

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
As long as you use the tone.

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But if I get a call from school, you are rounded.

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, podcasting tones are fun.

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hey, yeah, they are.

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Watch this.

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Watch this.

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Kiss my...

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Go!

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yourself.

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, that's a bad one.

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's a bad one.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But hey, this is a podcast.

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We don't have to use tones.

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, yeah.

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, I don't, but you still have to.

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, shh.

229
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hey, hey, you watch your tone.

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Listen to Worlds of Wayne.

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Get it on iTunes or check it out on Worlds of Wayne.com.

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Worlds of Wayne.

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I love that.

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And people accuse me of me using my child for profit and entertainment purposes.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Great.

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Watch your tone, young lady.

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Fantastic.

239
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Portions of this show brought to you by accurate.

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Check out the new RDX SUV.

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We've got a target cast, which is really.

242
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's an infomercial, except we think a lot more interesting.

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And not so in your face, and it does go in depth.

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And it's a lot of fun.

245
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You can find that at accurate.podshow.com.

246
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
A couple of weeks ago, actually, let me play this thing for you.

247
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
First, you know, this is the kind of stuff I'm now getting out of my voice mail.

248
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now that now the voice mail is, I guess it's being published.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's on the show, show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And people are just using it to leave me messages.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Check this.

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hi, this message is for Adam Curry.

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
My name is Blake Landown.

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm from Technology IQ, a Division of IQ PC.

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We are a research conference company, and I'm putting.

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I am not reading this from a script.

257
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Together, a conference on content management.

258
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And I wanted to invite you to sit on a panel about podcasting with some other individuals, including

259
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Chris McDonald and Accenture, two people from IBM.

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Michael Priestley and Jamie Roberts, and also Steve Dowling, Manager at Apple.

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think I know him.

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I think I know him.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Because podcasting, please give me a call at your earliest convenience, and you can reach

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
me at six.

265
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, this is so unbelievable.

266
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And so this goes on all the time.

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Six, four, six, five, three.

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, man.

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Stop with the phone numbers already.

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, it would have been nice if she had said folder or scruncher.

272
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, so she's clearly never listened to the show.

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I get this all the time.

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There's just tons and tons of requests.

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The ones from the Netherlands, I just completely ignore.

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But you can imagine that Ron gets a lot of requests.

277
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And we're busy.

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We're on different sides of the world, literally.

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Working in multiple times, time zones.

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We're just going nuts, just doing our thing.

281
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You know, and an interview is always, it's always an hour and a half.

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You got to just sit down and think, prepare for five minutes.

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And there's blah, blah, blah, preamble.

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And then we talk.

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I think the way Ron and I are, we usually like to take our time.

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And we don't want it to be rushed.

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You know, we might as well not do it at all.

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So several weeks ago, Joseph Jaffey, who does a podcast called Across the Sound,

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
he used to have a partner and now he does it himself.

290
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And it's the new marketing podcast.

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Now he had requested a joint Skype interview with Ron and I for a while.

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And now I'm subscribed to a show.

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So I listened to it.

294
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And I said, I think we should do this because there's marketing people that listen to it.

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think it'd be pretty interesting.

296
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So this took the typical few weeks of scheduling.

297
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Again, still two different time zones.

298
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think Joseph had a was right in the middle.

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And I think he's in Westport, Connecticut.

300
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So we had three time zones to work with.

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You know, it's a chunk out of our day.

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So especially a Skype interview.

303
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's always going to be an hour and a half.

304
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So, you know, we set it up.

305
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And we do the interview.

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I thought was great.

307
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You know, Ron and I were just chatting away with Joseph.

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It really wasn't an interview.

309
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Although it was and was prefaced as such.

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But it was it was a good chatting.

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Personally, I even told Joseph, I said,

312
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Dude, you know, you shouldn't edit this at all.

313
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You should just leave it.

314
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I mean, leave all the, all the, all the crap in there.

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I love that.

316
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah.

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And you guys listen to the Charlie.

318
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know, I love that.

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It makes it fun.

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
All the best bits never made it on to MTV, right?

321
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Um, so he said it was going to do it as episode number 50,

322
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
which he thought in what's, you know, it's the big episode 50.

323
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That was fine.

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's great.

325
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Love it.

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I listened to it.

327
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He did something that I don't really like normally.

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
In this case, I don't like it either.

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Um, it's he split the interview up into two parts.

330
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Now, the Steve Gilmore started doing this with the Gilmore gang.

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And I don't like it.

332
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It doesn't work for me because, um, I want to hear the whole thing.

333
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You know, I want to control when I can listen to the rest or not.

334
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And it feels now like I'm being held hostage to stay tuned to something.

335
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So, not digging that.

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I don't like it when it's done with interviews that way.

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It just seems like, you know, why?

338
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know, you could use next week's zeitgeist is so many different ways.

339
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You know, and things can change.

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And maybe you get busy.

341
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Whatever.

342
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So, anyway, so we cut it in half.

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Um, and he, um, I did hear, I don't know if he edited a lot.

344
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Didn't sound like it in the, in the first half.

345
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Maybe some bits.

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Maybe his own stumbles that he took out.

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's, that's pretty typical.

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's what Rob does.

349
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A forward podcast for one.

350
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
One is he takes out all the ohms and the stumbles that he does.

351
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is so, it's so contrary to what I like.

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Um, so I just said I'm subscribed to the show.

353
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So I heard the episode 15 and episode 51 comes in.

354
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And there's something very surprising that Mr. Jeff is saying.

355
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Please listen along.

356
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank that the you know is actually our positive and quite constructive.

357
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I guess it's a little bit of soundvertising as per Adam Curry.

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Speaking of which, this is meant to be part two of the Part Show interview with Ron Bloom and Adam Curry.

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Uh, I am not going to play part two of the interview on episode 51.

360
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And I'm going to do that for two reasons.

361
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
One.

362
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, all right.

363
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Uh, so this had my interest.

364
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh, he's not going to play part two for two reasons.

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Now let's listen to the first reason, which I presume is the reason.

366
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Because I've been so busy.

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I've never been this busy in my entire life.

368
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And that's not necessarily a good thing.

369
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And I just have not had the opportunity to edit part two of that interview.

370
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The second you really need to go and look at.

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
At his website.

372
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And reluctantly I'll post a link to it on daily source code dot com in the show notes.

373
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You know, sometimes where voices just don't match up with with the face.

374
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Um, this is one of those cases.

375
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, I guarantee you that you have a very different image of what Joseph Jaffee looks like.

376
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Because actually he's a good looking guy as, you know, as guys go.

377
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But he sounds like, you know, Roger Smalls territory.

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Anyway, so that was reason or one crazy busy.

379
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No time wanted to edit couldn't do it.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Never been this busy in my life.

381
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And here's what he's going to play it off on part is I have got absolutely no love from Adam Curry.

382
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I haven't even had a mention on the daily source code about the interview.

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No traffic driving.

384
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No love.

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No referrals.

386
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No track backs.

387
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And so I think I'm just going to hold part two of the posture interview hostage.

388
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
All right.

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So he didn't have time to edit the interview.

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He didn't have time because he's never been busy in his life.

391
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, he's going to hold part two hostage.

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because I've given him no love, no attention, no promotion, no traffic.

393
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry, Joseph.

394
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I didn't know that this was like an audition or something for your show.

395
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You know, we went through trouble to schedule this.

396
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You know, out of the bottom of our hearts, I'm a listener.

397
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But now it's like because I didn't promote your show.

398
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And I didn't send you love.

399
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Joseph, Joseph, I know you're listening.

400
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hey, dude, come here for a second.

401
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Bend over.

402
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm about to give you some love.

403
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Bitch, can't believe you're doing this.

404
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is so stupid and wrong.

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And, you know, it's like it's offensive.

406
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I spent an hour and a half, you know, answering your questions, you know, for your podcast.

407
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then you chop it in half.

408
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You know, I figure I'm waiting till I send over a lot of love, Mr. Chopin.

409
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And until such time that I get a little bit of acknowledgement from Mr. Curry.

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, now it's Mr. Curry.

411
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And you want acknowledgment from Bend over, bitch.

412
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Affluent suburb of Geoford.

413
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's the affluent suburb of Surrey.

414
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's actually engulford.

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
In Surrey, London, the United Kingdom, Europe, the world.

416
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And as soon as he gives me that love, I will give him love back in return.

417
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
All right.

418
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't want your love, okay?

419
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm not interested.

420
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're good looking guy, but I don't want your love.

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Now, I hereby withdraw all permission to air my interview, part two.

422
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You can't have it.

423
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I do not give my consent for you to air that interview.

424
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Fuck you.

425
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You nuts?

426
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do not air that interview.

427
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Part one's already out there.

428
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's okay.

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You may not air part two until such time as that I feel you've given me enough love.

430
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Then maybe, maybe I'll consider it.

431
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Voice mail numbers plus one two zero one six two five six three five seven.

432
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But the plus and front.

433
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's for if you're entering it into your cell phone plus one two zero one six two five six three five seven in London.

434
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh two oh seven six eight one three seven five three.

435
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm number three now on the business week best of the web.

436
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Ask a ninja number one by far by far.

437
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's such a and number two is NPR.

438
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So it's just not not one specific NPR podcast, but NPR.

439
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And then comes daily source code.

440
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You can write in your own favorites though.

441
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So I fully expect Keith and the girl to be on their soon and Dawn and Drew.

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Uh, I'll put a link in the show notes.

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You can go find it podcast peer awards.

Is it the first time?

448
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't even know podcast peer awards.

449
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Find us a bit of an ounce number.

It's great.

466
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Congratulations.

467
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Great job you guys.

468
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Great fucking job very proud.

469
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Hey, I'm Drew Cohen from Phoenix Arizona.

470
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Wanting to take exception to the discussion of sensing that's been going on lately.

471
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I am a 15 year fancier moon lighting is a sometimes sensing coach.

472
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
When I'm not at my day job as a open source software programmer.

473
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think anyone who says that sensing is a faggy sport hasn't really been involved with it a whole lot.

474
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's an extra very intense very athletic sport.

475
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Understand that the uniforms and such aren't the most attractive things.

476
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Certainly not something I'm going to wear going out for an item at town.

477
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But in reality they're really not all that different from the uniforms worn in football and baseball and other sports.

478
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know there's plenty of safety reasons and things like that.

479
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Obviously for them.

480
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But to describe it as faggy I think is unfair and not something that people better involved with it would even come up with.

481
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

482
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm going to get so much trouble for this.

483
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I loved fencing.

484
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I just thought that the uniforms weren't the most masculine uniforms in the world.

485
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Particularly if you've got a build like mine.

486
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hey, play some football as an American football.

487
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah, you look good no matter what kind of physique you have.

488
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And with faggy I just mean not really manly.

489
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't mean anything really sexual about it.

490
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
On the other hand, other callers have mentioned that they can kill you with one stroke.

491
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And I think that's a little bit ridiculous as well.

492
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The sport fencing is after all the sports rules aren't exactly what I would call useful for real dueling situations.

493
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I certainly wouldn't expect that the fencing that I've learned would be able to save my life if some weird situations were.

494
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I disagree man.

495
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I totally disagree.

496
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
In martial arts they'll tell you as well that if you have anything in your hand like a newspaper or an umbrella.

497
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Or an umbrella or a newspaper is actually a really good example of rolled up newspaper.

498
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You can actually thwart off a knife thread and maybe even a gun thread.

499
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You know, that's that whole parade deal you do, you know.

500
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And okay, you don't want to like swivel around and stick them with your fingers because they ain't going to do much.

501
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But you can definitely defend yourself.

502
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I disagree.

503
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I think that there are many, many advantages to that type of thing.

504
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Anyway, I just wanted to give you a brief brief.

505
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I want to see you back on that.

506
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If you want to check out my fencing club actually, we're at easyfencing.com.

507
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You are ever in the scenic area.

508
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Sure would love to give you a quick lesson.

509
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Maybe I can say a little bit about saber.

510
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Since you said you never got to check that out.

511
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Maybe we could set up some kind of podcast smack down and get you in Marcus.

512
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You should learn an improv to beat on each other with some metal sticks.

513
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Anyway, that's all for now.

514
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Thanks.

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh and folder.

516
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Uh-huh.

517
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
There's nothing I can cut off of the boy.

518
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't want to do that.

519
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
No, no, no, that would be very wrong.

520
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah, I'm going to go to Phoenix.

521
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Thank you very much for the invitation.

522
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That's very nice of you.

523
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Should I ever happen to be in Phoenix?

524
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, maybe.

525
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't think I'd actually go out of my way to do it.

526
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Let me, oh, I just need to, if only I could get in some fencing today.

527
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Hey, by the way, the new place.

528
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's so close to the airport.

529
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, man.

530
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,400
I can actually fly from flying in from big and hill towards the

531
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Arkham VR.

532
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
If I deviate, I'm not going to tell you how much you're aware, but if I deviate

533
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
just slightly, I'll fly right over the house.

534
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I'll call with that be.

535
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
Ah, still no phone call.

536
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Still waiting to see if we actually capture the new cottage.

537
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Which really isn't a cottage.

538
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Alright, come up with a new name for it.

539
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Uh, let me see.

540
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What else do I have here?

541
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Uh, who sent me this?

542
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Sinclair sent me.

543
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Ah, that's really cool.

544
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
From, uh, Hammaker Schleimer.

545
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's, uh, little drumsticks.

546
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You plug into your iPod and then you can drum along.

547
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And it, uh, as you drum on the table, it can create all kinds of drum sounds.

548
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I like this.

549
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It triggers it off.

550
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Uh, that might be something to plug into the mixer.

551
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Thank you.

552
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's only like 20.

553
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Was it for 25 bucks?

554
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I think we'll get that.

555
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Very cool, man.

556
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Thank you very much.

557
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Hey, Adam.

558
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's Bill.

559
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You know, I was just listening to, uh, Charlie 440.

560
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm catching up.

561
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And, uh, again, mentioned that he was an origami folder.

562
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And it made me think about something now.

563
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm not going to tell you whether I'm a folder scruncher.

564
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's just, just, I don't know, a little bit too personal.

565
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But, uh, I won't say that I found myself, uh, trying in the, uh, other way.

566
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And, uh, you know, it made me wonder.

567
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I wonder how many, uh, of your listeners have now experimented with, uh, whatever the other option is.

568
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uh, other than what they normally do.

569
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That might be interesting.

570
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
No.

571
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So, have a good one.

572
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Ah, shit, folder.

573
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah.

574
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I knew it.

575
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't know.

576
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I've, I certainly have.

577
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And by the way, people who, who wonder what this whole folder scruncher thing is about.

578
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And why I continue to talk about it.

579
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, obviously, people are calling in and saying scruncher of folder just does identify you as,

580
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
which part of the human race you belong to.

581
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And, of course, it gives me a great excuse to play this.

582
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Hey, Adam David from South Florida here.

583
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Uh, it's quarter to 12 on Friday.

584
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Uh, just listening to episode something or other, uh, four, five, two.

585
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Anyway, trying to subscribe to Perversion for profit here.

586
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And I can't find a, and a link anywhere here on your, uh, on your, uh, on your podcast site.

587
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I don't want to use pod share plus.

588
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I think it's a great service, but I just don't have a useful word right now.

589
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I want to continue to use iTunes.

590
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Anyway, where's the link?

591
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
How do I subscribe to this thing?

592
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Uh, thanks.

593
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Thanks.

594
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
On glad you asked that.

595
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Uh, and some of these things are changing.

596
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We're updating the interface all the time.

597
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And it's going to change quite radically.

598
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I think we'll do a, uh, one very radical change.

599
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Um, if you go to any episode of any show on, uh, pod share plus a pod share dot com.

600
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Uh, so you, you have a show site.

601
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It'll show you the most recent episode.

602
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You can go there, go into the archives.

603
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Every single of those pages has all the different options.

604
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It has an, uh, an RSS link for raw RSS.

605
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It has an iTunes link, which it will actually subscribe you to the show,

606
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
just by clicking on it in iTunes.

607
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We also have a Windows media player.

608
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So you can play the episodes in your Windows media player.

609
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It doesn't download them, but it plays them on the fly.

610
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Same for, uh, for the real player.

611
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
No, I'm sorry.

612
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah, real player and a Win app.

613
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Nah.

614
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, Win app.

615
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's it.

616
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Um, now here's an interesting fact.

617
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So you could just go to any of the episodes.

618
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You can either copy the, uh, the XML in or just click on the iTunes link.

619
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It'll subscribe.

620
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
What's interesting.

621
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
If you create a channel and this may change your mind about, you know,

622
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you're using iTunes.

623
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's, we are definitely built to be used with iTunes and the iPod.

624
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So if you create a channel, you have a channel in your collection.

625
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And if you put shows in there,

626
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
if you actually click on the, uh,

627
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
uh, so if you click on the channel name itself,

628
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
it'll expand.

629
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And in there, you'll see, choose your favorite downloader.

630
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And if you select iTunes,

631
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
it'll download every new episode from each podcast.

632
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
As it comes out from all the shows in that channel.

633
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So you may want to revisit experiment.

634
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Let me know if it works for you.

635
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Or if it doesn't, please, definitely.

636
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Why?

637
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
From day go to beach.

638
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's the, hey, Adam, can I leave it down here?

639
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And of course, day go to beach.

640
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Uh, hey, I was listening to your commentary on, uh, New Orleans.

641
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I can tell you how to help.

642
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I was down there about two weeks ago.

643
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
There are portions that are in pretty bad shape.

644
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
There's portions that are pretty good shape.

645
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And easy thing you can do to help is to go down there.

646
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Believe it or not, the, uh, the French Quarter is in great shape.

647
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Uh, they just need some business.

648
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And commerce is the way that you help build up the community.

649
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So if we have more tourists going down there,

650
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
uh, it creates jobs, creates income,

651
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
gives those people a chance put on their feet.

652
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So, and, and hey, you'll have a good time.

653
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
How can you beat that?

654
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Have a good time.

655
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You see an interesting place.

656
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You get to see the stuff firsthand.

657
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And, uh, and you're just in good.

658
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So, there you have it.

659
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Holder.

660
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'd like to thank you, folder.

661
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'd like to have your view, uh, your views on that.

662
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
If, if that really is the best thing to do.

663
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Um, although it's instinctively, it feels absolutely right.

664
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't know if going to the French Quarter is going to help everybody.

665
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But, uh, let's talk about it.

666
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Let me know what you feel what you think of there.

667
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Otherwise, we can help when you were,

668
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
we're right upon the, uh,

669
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
the first anniversary.

670
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Man, there's a lot of anniversaries.

671
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
9, 11 coming up.

672
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, it seems like TV is full of it.

673
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So happy we're now talking about that today.

674
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We're listening to Weird Nylon.

675
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
All weird.

676
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
All the time.

677
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000

Let's say we get the name.

680
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Nylon.

681

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And it's all about weird stuff.

684
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Defiliping judge really consults business will do ours while making decision.

685
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
This is the annual world in Rebellion against humanity.

686
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What's next with Pete Doherty?

Give us some feedback at CarlinWeirdNylon.com.

690
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If you've got any groovy stories, you know the kind of thing we like.

691
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Just drop us an email.

692
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Thanks very much for your time.

693
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Thanks for playing this.

694
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Cheers.

695
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Bye-bye.

696
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
All right, Parkie.

697
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Get this touch.

698
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Don't say it on.

699
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And I got to change that too.

700
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Don't say it didn't do anything for you, Parkie.

701
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Okay.

702
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Alrighty.

703
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We're coming down to the final final few days here for the EarthLink ad challenge.

704
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You've been hearing the finalists all over the network.

705
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The winner is going to run away with a couple grand.

706
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And of course, their commercial will be used in the official EarthLink.

707
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And I think we can go beyond that.

708
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Honestly, it's just so much creativity.

709
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'd love to have a couple of these others running in rotation.

710
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I think that they all receive some form of prize.

711
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So yeah.

712
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Okay, did everything else?

713
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Uh, that's about it.

714
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I could, let me just play this one then.

715
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
This is a celebrity endorsement from someone that you don't know.

716
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Of course you don't know me.

717
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The New York Times once called me the most famous person in New York that nobody knows.

718
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's true.

719
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Go ahead, search it.

720
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But you notice several hundred thousand people I am known as that guitar man from Central Park.

721
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And I'm here to tell you that EarthLink is just about the best thing you can get on the internet these days.

722
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I mean, if you're anything like me and you hate junk mail, EarthLink's spam blocker alone is worth the high speed connection that starts at 1295 a month.

723
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It comes with free anti-virus software, a firewall and spyware blocker.

724
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Look, take the word of somebody that you don't know.

725
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And you have no reason to trust.

726
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Get EarthLink.

727
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This is the song that I didn't have time to play yesterday.

728
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I like it a lot though.

729
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I can't, I think I've heard Christina talking about it.

730
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So let's load it up and blast it out today.

731
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay, I can get you with the 44.

732
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm gonna keep with the net.

733
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I can keep with the car doors.

734
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Let me hit inside it 17 tasks.

735
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I can keep with the block.

736
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm gonna keep with the mech.

737
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I can keep with the bottle of beer right over you too.

738
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I can keep it in this land.

739
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's time to be one more time.

740
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
If you want to be the one too.

741
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Bad energy.

742
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Think you're so fine.

743
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But there's so many ways I can kill you.

744
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Come on.

745
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Shut up, you shit.

746
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's in your life.

747
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Cause I don't want to hear you.

748
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But I can't, don't just run over.

749
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And there's so many ways I can't.

750
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
No.

751
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I can keep with the switch blade.

752
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Or I can use them shiny net.

753
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Just break out.

754
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The Terminator.

755
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I can't catch it.

756
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah.

757
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I can keep with the rest numbers.

758
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Just jamming your head.

759
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Or I can wax you with the moose.

760
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's cheese.

761
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So I'm covered in red.

762
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's time to leave one more time.

763
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
If you want to be the one too.

764
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Bad energy.

765
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Think you're so fine.

766
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But there's so many ways I can kill you.

767
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Shut up, you shit.

768
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's in your life.

769
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Cause I don't want to hear you.

770
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But I can't, don't just run over.

771
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And there's so many ways I can kill you.

772
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah.

773
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Well, I can keep with the toy in your hand.

774
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Or I can keep with the sound.

775
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Probably not the Hyundai.

776
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But I can still keep it in nothing.

777
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I can keep with the hit run.

778
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Or I can easily country drive.

779
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Run your down, escort it up.

780
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Your ass stuck under my four wheel drive.

781
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And it's time to be one more time.

782
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
If you want to be the one too.

783
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Bad energy.

784
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Think you're so fine.

785
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But there's so many ways I can kill you.

786
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Shut up, you shit.

787
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's in your life.

788
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Cause I don't want to hear you.

789
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Don't just run over.

790
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
There's so many ways I can kill you.

791
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
That's the break-up.

792
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
No.

793
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Death and destruction.

794
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Scorer know they hit on the wall.

795
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
When the jacks attacks us, wax with the next.

796
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
To print the backs of the black chain attacks.

797
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So many ways I can kill you.

798
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Some of your ways you can die.

799
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Some of your ways I'm gonna get you.

800
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So let's just rip it up one more time.

801
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But I'm a sucker.

802
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm a sucker.

803
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm a sucker.

804
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm a sucker.

805
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm a sucker.

806
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm a sucker.

807
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm a sucker.

808
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm a sucker.

809
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm a sucker.

810
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm a sucker.

811
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm a sucker.

812
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm a sucker.

813
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm a sucker.

814
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm a sucker.

815
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm a sucker.

816
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm a sucker.

817
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm a sucker.

818
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm a sucker.

819
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm a sucker.

820
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm a sucker.

821
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm a sucker.

822
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm a sucker.

823
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm a sucker.

824
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm a sucker.

825
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm a sucker.

826
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm a sucker.

827
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm a sucker.

828
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm a sucker.

829
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm a sin of broken shit.

830
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm a happens week.

831
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But if you want to feel it that someone's wrong,

832
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
you can't fall.

833
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,620
Until I hear what that sounds like

834
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,000
just for a long time, if you want to feel it.

835
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,740
