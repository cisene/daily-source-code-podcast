Delta Shara Charlie 319.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sometimes some atoms on a loan.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And he needs his love right there on the microphone.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So here she is, yes, the Lady Patricia.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The say-to-heads are better than one.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And with this angel from above, there's nothing that they both can't do.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And let the fabulous show begin.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's Adam and Patricia.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Adam and the Lady Patricia.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
My life is brilliant.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What, was I too early?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sorry, should I?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you want to start over?

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Keep going?

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My life is brilliant.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Your life's a joke.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Your just pathetic.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Your always broke.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Your home may start trek uniform.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Really ain't impressing me.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your suffering from the illusions of the adequacy.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're beautiful.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're beautiful.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're beautiful.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's true.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Never had a date that you couldn't inflate.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And you smell repulsive too.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What a bummer bein' you.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well you just can't dance.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And forget romance.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Everybody you know still calls you.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Party pins, but you always have a job.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well I mean as long as you still could work.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's where be my sheet.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're beautiful.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're beautiful.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're beautiful. It's true.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're handsome.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's you.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're beautiful.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're beautiful.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's you.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're beautiful.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're beautiful.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're beautiful.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're beautiful.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're beautiful.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're beautiful.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,620
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la luzzar

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,260
Y'all beautiful, y'all beautiful

62
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,300
Y'all beautiful, this true

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,400
Y'all would much rather play fetch by itself

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:07,400
You've got to live with your mom when you're 42.

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Guess you'll never grow up.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,400
When it just sucks to be you.

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,400
The infallible weird al-yanko, you're pitiful.

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm not sure the legalities of playing that song, but I do know that the owner of the song,

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,400
which of course is not who wrote it, but the record company, wouldn't allow him to put that song on his album.

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Oh, really?

71
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Yeah, so he put it up on his website, so I figured, well, you know.

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Well, how did you do that when he recorded the song from Michael Jackson?

73
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Michael Jackson agreed.

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
You don't.

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
I believe that.

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
I believe that.

77
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
I believe the law is that you don't for a parody, which falls under fair use.

78
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
You don't have to have permission, but weird al is always asked permission of all the artists.

79
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
So if they didn't like it, they didn't do it.

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
But yeah.

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
And what a great singer he is, isn't it?

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
And how about that beginning, huh?

83
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
You know that always irritated me.

84
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
That's not what happened there.

85
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
And then they say, you know, it's cool.

86
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
It's cool.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Yeah, don't even start there.

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Yeah, it's fantastic.

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Just leave it.

90
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
It's so real.

91
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Name another song that has that.

92
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
I know one.

93
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
I know there's another one.

94
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:45,400
You know.

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
No, don't do that.

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
No, that's not nice.

97
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
That's not nice.

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Hey, everybody.

99
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
How you doing?

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,400
It's the daily source code coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey.

101
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
No one is killed for it.

102
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Where the cottage is located.

103
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Lady Patricia joining us on the show.

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Yeah.

105
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
What a lovely song about us.

106
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah, that's the privilege.

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
That's Jeff.

108
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Just have your own song.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Just like the nanny.

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Yeah.

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
It needs an applause and then cue lights.

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Can you Patricia with opening and joke?

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Yeah.

114
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
How is it, Jeff?

115
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Jeff feels.

116
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Yeah.

117
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
All right.

118
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
So we haven't heard from you for a couple of days.

119
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
We've been for about a week.

120
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I think the last time you were on show.

121
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
That's right.

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Yeah.

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
I missed you.

124
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Really?

125
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Yeah, but I had a lot of stuff that I had to do.

126
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,400
For mom and then I had to do some stuff for pod show.

127
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Yeah.

128
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Oh, everything came at one time.

129
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Isn't it always like that?

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
It sure is.

131
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
That's life.

132
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Yeah.

133
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
It really is.

134
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Yeah.

135
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
But on the other hand, maybe that was a good thing.

136
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
I don't know.

137
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
I don't know.

138
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I keep showing you, too.

139
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Oh, no kidding.

140
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm so tired.

141
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah.

142
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
And while you saw Bloom.

143
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Yeah.

144
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Yeah.

145
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
He's tired.

146
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
He's very tired.

147
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Yeah.

148
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Yeah.

149
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah.

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Yeah.

151
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
And so is his lovely, lovely lady.

152
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Is he tired too?

153
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Maybe Bloom.

154
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Is she tired?

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Yeah, she is.

156
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Are you tired?

157
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm tired from wrong being tired.

158
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Oh, yes.

159
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I've heard of this.

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I understand him and being late.

161
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
And go to bed late.

162
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Mm-hmm.

163
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Not listening to her because he doesn't hear her.

164
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
She that sounds familiar, doesn't it?

165
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Yeah.

166
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
It's so funny yesterday.

167
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
But she's like, you don't hear me.

168
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
That's just like Ron not hearing Marta.

169
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I said, yeah.

170
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Trust me.

171
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Test me.

172
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
And I tested him.

173
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
And he's like something you said 10 minutes before.

174
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Yeah.

175
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
And I literally didn't know.

176
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I was telling you something.

177
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
But Christina, you didn't hear me.

178
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Yeah, I feel like shit about that.

179
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
I'm sorry.

180
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
I'm trying to do my best.

181
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I do understand.

182
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
You know?

183
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
I got a lot to think about.

184
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,400
When men are lazy and not listening.

185
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Like Keith?

186
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
That's wrong.

187
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,400
But if you know the very busy, you know, doing something really, really good and incredible.

188
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Oh, thank you.

189
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Then it's understandable.

190
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Well, thank you.

191
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
I'll take that as an endorsement.

192
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
As long as they're not lazy.

193
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,400
The only thing that's really a shame is, you know,

194
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,400
so here we've had this incredible team of people working so hard to get everything going

195
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,400
out for Cisco and around the world, actually, because we have people all over the world working with us side by side.

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Yeah.

197
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,400
And which I'm extremely appreciative.

198
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,400
And you have not yet even looked at podshow plus.

199
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
And it hurts so bad.

200
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
It hurts so bad.

201
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
And you just won't do it.

202
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Yeah, it does.

203
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
If this is like, you know, this is our,

204
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Well, haven't had the time for it.

205
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
It's our art.

206
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
But this is what we've been working on.

207
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,400
This is for all those nights that I came to bed late for all those hurried sex sessions because it was so late.

208
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,400
If there was one.

209
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,400
I got to keep my image up for all those times when I didn't hear what you said.

210
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Yeah.

211
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Now you can, are you afraid that when you look at it, you'll say it was all for that?

212
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
No, no, no, actually.

213
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I thought, you know, my time will come.

214
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
What does that mean?

215
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,400
To to to look at it.

216
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
But in the meanwhile, life goes on around you.

217
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
I understand a lot of things.

218
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
You can just look at it if you just for 10 minutes.

219
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
10 minutes.

220
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Now it takes more.

221
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
We need Patricia on the plus.

222
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Everyone wants Patricia on the bus.

223
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
You see, you have no idea how good you are at surfing.

224
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I mean, you think that you don't know what you're doing,

225
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,400
but you can get through all those wacky messed up real estate websites,

226
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
which make no sense at all.

227
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
And you actually can retrieve information and send it on to me.

228
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Yeah.

229
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
You are much, much better than you think you are.

230
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm getting there.

231
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I'm getting there.

232
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Yeah.

233
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Now don't be embarrassed.

234
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Look Christina hates it.

235
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Oh.

236
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Well, I mean, she doesn't hate it, but she says it doesn't work like my space.

237
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I said, no, it's not supposed to.

238
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Well, of course not.

239
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Yeah.

240
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
But she's given us some great feedback.

241
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
And she got a contract.

242
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
We're going to sign.

243
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Yeah, we're going to sign.

244
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
We've got to get the new printer and then we'll sign now.

245
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
She's going to sign her contract.

246
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I guess I have to sign for her since she's not 16 yet.

247
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Almost.

248
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Yeah.

249
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
She's almost.

250
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Now she's excited about it.

251
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Yeah.

252
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Yeah.

253
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
She's totally into it.

254
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Oh, that's good.

255
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
She played those guys who were going to perform in her sweet 16.

256
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
She played one of their tracks.

257
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,400
She's becoming such a little, um, little mogul.

258
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Yeah.

259
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Very interested in young groups, new groups.

260
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,400
And, um, signed groups, of course.

261
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
And that's nice.

262
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
That's, that's, that's very good.

263
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm, I'm glad she wants to help them.

264
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, glad we have.

265
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm glad we can actually do this.

266
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Because, you know, we were out looking for a place.

267
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,400
There's not a lot of places in Guildford for, um, independent musicians to play.

268
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Yeah.

269
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
No.

270
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
And not at all.

271
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
So, I guess getting your stuff out there on podcasts is really is good.

272
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah.

273
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah.

274
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
It's a pod.

275
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
There is a lot of talents in, uh, Guildford.

276
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Absolutely.

277
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Yeah.

278
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Because there are very good music schools here.

279
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Mm-hmm.

280
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
So they're, they're very good educated in music.

281
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Yeah.

282
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
And I have to say.

283
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
And I have to say.

284
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I'm privileged lives.

285
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,400
And I heard a couple of bands that she, uh, she wanted me to listen to.

286
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Really good stuff, huh?

287
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Very good.

288
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Yeah.

289
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Very good.

290
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I was, I was impressed.

291
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
She has to get those in the pod, take music network.

292
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
That's, that's what she's working on.

293
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Yeah.

294
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Yeah.

295
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Yeah.

296
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Yeah.

297
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Yeah.

298
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Yeah.

299
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
It does that every time, introduce a new band or anything.

300
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Yeah.

301
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
That's, that's very nice.

302
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Yeah.

303
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Indeed.

304
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Hey.

305
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Adam, uh, the funny atmosphere.

306
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Yeah.

307
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
That's that.

308
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Who's show really is pressure you rock?

309
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
You know, you tell like a great wife.

310
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Um, very, uh.

311
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
The great wife.

312
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
You are the great wife.

313
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
You hear that?

314
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Yeah.

315
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
I tell you, people love you.

316
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Here, listen to this.

317
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Right.

318
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Very engaging, very sexy.

319
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Flathead, big ears.

320
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Um, I give you guys lots of credit as my wife, Aaron, and I, uh, uh, uh, uh,

321
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
I live at our almost six year anniversary.

322
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
No.

323
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
What are you guys talking about?

324
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
I keep your marriage fresh.

325
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I keep it exciting.

326
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I'd love to hear about it.

327
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Um, keep on doing what you're doing.

328
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Um, despite how long you've been doing this.

329
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
And it hasn't been that long.

330
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
You guys still do a great show.

331
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
It's very fresh.

332
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Correct.

333
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Regret from San Francisco.

334
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Yeah.

335
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
How do we do it?

336
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I don't know.

337
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
You tell me.

338
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
I, I think you just put up with me.

339
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
And that's about it.

340
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Well, um, I think it is patients and respect.

341
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
F patients for each other.

342
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
And try to understand why.

343
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Why someone is acting like an occasion.

344
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Yeah.

345
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Acting like a few.

346
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Just take a step back and think.

347
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Okay.

348
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
What happened there?

349
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Why is this?

350
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
And, you know, where's coming from?

351
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Yeah.

352
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
And that's what you have to do.

353
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I think I think what it is.

354
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
No.

355
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
It's very simple.

356
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
You're a mature woman.

357
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Oh, I don't know.

358
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Is that what you say?

359
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
You said, oh, it's very simple.

360
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Well, let me finish.

361
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Okay.

362
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
You're a mature woman.

363
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
You know, most people when they get married.

364
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Or when they share their lives together.

365
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
They start around.

366
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Let's say 20, 20, 30.

367
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,400
We're already 38 when I met you.

368
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,400
And I was in between the 20 and 30 age range, like 22.

369
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
So you had a lot of patients with me.

370
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Yeah.

371
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,400
And now as you grow older and see now, I have more patients with you.

372
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Just kidding.

373
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Well, there you go.

374
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
That's what they might say.

375
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Patients are scanning and respect.

376
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Just kidding.

377
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
That's it.

378
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
You know, no matter what.

379
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
No matter what.

380
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
No matter what.

381
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
No matter what.

382
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
But yeah, I think that's the thing.

383
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,400
And I am a little bit old-fashioned.

384
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I have to say.

385
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
That's true.

386
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
And you know, it's all for the good.

387
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,400
And I think that a woman should take care of herself.

388
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Oh.

389
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,400
And because you're going to get a lot of interesting response to that.

390
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Well, if you take care of yourself and you feel you look good.

391
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Then, you know, the whole thing around you.

392
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,400
And also reach your husband and, you know, with the men around you.

393
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
It works out.

394
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Just, you know.

395
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,400
But in general, you hate men and would not want to live with one if you could choose differently.

396
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I have not a lot of patients for a lot of men.

397
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Sort.

398
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Sort of men.

399
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I went through the voicemail.

400
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Voicemail box today.

401
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I had about 80 different voicemails.

402
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
You know, from back, even before when mom died.

403
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
But after mom died, I noticed that a lot of women started calling.

404
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,400
And I keep asking for women to call in and leave messages.

405
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,400
And now all of a sudden, there must have been 45% female voices that I heard.

406
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
It was interesting that all of a sudden they come.

407
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
You know, that's when they come out when it's about emotions and stuff.

408
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Yeah.

409
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Yeah.

410
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Yeah.

411
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,400
When I just want sexy calls or naked pictures, I never get any response.

412
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
No.

413
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
And now you did.

414
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Yeah.

415
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Check it out.

416
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
In celebration of beautiful women around the world.

417
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
This is KFC from pod.

418
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Check.com.

419
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,400
And again, the writing rather than convertible to hot sunny day in Toronto.

420
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Where in my bikini.

421
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
But I wanted to comment on the beautiful women in London.

422
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I was there last weekend.

423
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
It is so amazing.

424
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
True.

425
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
And we have a new pod.

426
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Check them out on today's show Friday.

427
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
3 p.m.

428
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Check it out.

429
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Hot chicks around the world.

430
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Send in your photos.

431
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
All right, Adam.

432
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
You have an amazing weekend.

433
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
And make them smile.

434
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Sounds good.

435
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Yeah.

436
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Yeah.

437
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Yeah.

438
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Now, this is about the English girls.

439
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Letting it all hang out.

440
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Oh, yeah.

441
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Oh, yeah.

442
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Oh, yeah.

443
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I mean, guys walk without sure.

444
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
I mean, maybe they're all poo poo.

445
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
And they know their manners.

446
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,400
But the minute the sun cracks through the clouds.

447
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Yes.

448
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
It's no damn boobies.

449
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
And we have a drink.

450
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
We have to have a drink and show them boobies.

451
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Oh, yeah.

452
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Another one.

453
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
This is that Jeff.

454
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Listen, that will be July.

455
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
And glad the boobs are out in London.

456
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
You're in Hawaii.

457
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
They never go away.

458
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Yeah.

459
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
So I missed a couple of really good ones.

460
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Yeah.

461
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Check this out.

462
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
This is really cool.

463
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Hey, Adam.

464
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
It's Richard calling.

465
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
It's 120 in the morning.

466
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,400
And you're down for me on the 50 July.

467
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,400
And you know, Alan, I figured that once England got knocked out of the World Cup that we

468
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,400
thought it was about time, we started a family and what better to do it than on the 4th of July.

469
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,400
So the 1141 PM on the 4th of July.

470
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
That might be a beautiful life.

471
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Keepers to a beautiful daughter.

472
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Addison Brewer, hey.

473
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Red hair, blue eyes, six pounds, 14 ounces.

474
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,400
And a nice 12, 22 inches long.

475
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
So she's doing great.

476
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Mom's doing great.

477
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,400
And the only thing is, when I'd like to plug anything in here at the hospital.

478
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,400
So we don't get to listen to the BSC for another couple of days.

479
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
But we'll get right back on track.

480
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
I'll show you.

481
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,400
And I'm still, I'm still in my blackberry on period.

482
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
To check for emails from the public services.

483
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
And for those people that want to get on the show, take it easy out of sight.

484
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Yeah, that is new baby in the background.

485
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Is that a proud pop out there? Is that cool?

486
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I remember that moment.

487
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Oh, yeah, I remember too. That was fantastic.

488
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Yeah, I was 26 centimeters long.

489
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,400
But really? And what was Addison 22?

490
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
What did he say? 22, 22, 24.

491
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Those inches that she said inches.

492
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
I think he said inches.

493
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
What's she inches 26?

494
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Yeah.

495
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Must have cancer centimeters.

496
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
You can carry that in your pocket.

497
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
It's my blackberry's bigger than that.

498
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
No, it was inches.

499
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

500
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Because I always think in centimeters.

501
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
But it's inches.

502
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Did you hear it? I heard something else. She's a ginger.

503
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Yeah.

504
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Yeah.

505
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
We got a ginger in the family.

506
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Yeah.

507
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
That's like not a good thing here in the UK.

508
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Yes, it is.

509
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Are you sure?

510
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Oh, yeah.

511
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Whenever I hear someone talking about someone with red hair,

512
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
they talk about them like a ginger.

513
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,400
They always say they must be very sexy.

514
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Why?

515
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
They are very sexy.

516
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Why?

517
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
I don't know.

518
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
You've never had a ginger.

519
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I'm trying to think of it.

520
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
I've ever had a ginger.

521
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Did you?

522
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Yeah.

523
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
I'm trying to think.

524
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I don't think I've ever had a ginger either.

525
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
No.

526
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
No.

527
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Let me think.

528
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
No, no.

529
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Don't give me that.

530
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm sorry.

531
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm sorry.

532
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm sorry.

533
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Was it not a ginger?

534
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Oh, really?

535
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Robbie Dale.

536
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Robbie Dale?

537
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Yes, that's not.

538
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
From a radio Luxembourg?

539
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Yes.

540
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
This is the big sound of radio Luxembourg.

541
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Robbie Dale.

542
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
He had a, but he had a, he was a ginger.

543
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
I'm sorry, Charlie.

544
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
And he had a beard, didn't he?

545
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Wasn't he a ginger with a beard?

546
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
I don't know.

547
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
I can't believe he's not doing a ginger beard.

548
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Yeah.

549
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
The ginger beard, man.

550
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Yeah.

551
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Why did you do that?

552
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
I don't know.

553
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Robbie Dale.

554
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Yeah, right.

555
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Why?

556
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
I don't know.

557
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Does he, is he still alive this evening?

558
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Is he still around?

559
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Well, I'm sorry.

560
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
It was in the evening.

561
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Wait a minute.

562
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Where are we?

563
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
He was in the evening.

564
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Where are we?

565
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
He was in the evening.

566
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
And he had a sort of a blind date that evening.

567
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
And Lex Harding was with Ivan.

568
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
And with Robbie Dale, I think.

569
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I got, I got Robbie Dale.

570
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,400
And it's best if you go on a blind date with Robbie Dale that you're actually blind.

571
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
That would actually, that's better.

572
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
I have to say that he's a very funny guy.

573
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Yeah.

574
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,400
And you know, and humor sometimes makes you horny.

575
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
That's all.

576
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
But, but it all stayed with the dogging.

577
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
So I guess his jokes weren't that good, huh?

578
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
And now we're from our spine tier.

579
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
It's the yanks versus the brits.

580
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Oh yeah.

581
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
We'll drive each other crazy.

582
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,400
But everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

583
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Let's just like you and me.

584
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
It's the yanks.

585
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
And in the brits.

586
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,400
The yanks versus the brits.

587
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Mind the gag.

588
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Okay.

589
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
So I just running through all these voicemails.

590
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
I found a great yanks versus the brits question.

591
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
And one that maybe you and I can help answer.

592
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
In fact, I don't even know the way you do it.

593
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
All right.

594
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I had them come and see them here.

595
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
A long time listener of the Charlie.

596
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I have a question for you.

597
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
I was looking through a recent article for my new scientist magazine.

598
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,400
And it was talking about how Americans would like to use their toilet paper

599
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,400
by scrunching it for its brits tend to fall in it.

600
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Perhaps you can say, shed some light on this for me.

601
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Because I'm not really understanding what scrunching it is.

602
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Meaning when it's talking about toilet paper.

603
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Thank you so much.

604
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,400
So the question is, are he read a new scientist?

605
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
A new scientist?

606
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
No.

607
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
But this is interesting.

608
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,400
He read a new scientist magazine that apparently Americans scrunch the toilet paper before using it.

609
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Where's the brits fold the toilet paper before using it?

610
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Hmm.

611
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
And I really would not know.

612
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,400
And I'd like you to tell our audience, of course.

613
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Do you want to?

614
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
No.

615
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm a folder.

616
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Are you a scruncher?

617
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
I'm a folder.

618
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Absolutely.

619
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Folder.

620
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Folder, folder.

621
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Interesting.

622
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Do you think Americans really scrunch it?

623
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I think if you scrunch and bunch it.

624
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,400
You also use a lot of paper.

625
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
I think, you know, they just...

626
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
How much paper do you use?

627
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Too much.

628
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Really?

629
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Yeah.

630
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Because it's a problem in the toilet.

631
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
I remember that sometimes.

632
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
And I think, why do I use so much?

633
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
But then you use more than me because I never had any.

634
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
And I wonder for what?

635
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm so, you wonder for what?

636
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
For what?

637
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Why you use so much paper?

638
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
What?

639
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Oh, okay.

640
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
For what?

641
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Let us know.

642
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Are you a scruncher or a folder inquiring mind?

643
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
No.

644
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
We're from our sponsor.

645
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
It's very not done.

646
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
No.

647
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
But what we do.

648
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
And that's why we don't use that much.

649
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
It's a good idea what we're doing.

650
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Oh, the...

651
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
The bodies.

652
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
The bodies for the...

653
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Can't believe we're talking about this.

654
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
But it's so refreshing.

655
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
It's lovely.

656
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Yeah.

657
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
It's always put a box in the toilet.

658
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
It's very complimentary.

659
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Complimentary?

660
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
To what?

661
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
To the service?

662
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
To the rest of the service while you're in there?

663
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Please enjoy one of our body wipes.

664
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
It's a compliments service of our washroom.

665
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Compliments of that.

666
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Mind the gap.

667
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Yes.

668
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
But it's true.

669
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
It's very refreshing.

670
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
You feel very clean.

671
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
And I think everybody should do it.

672
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Thank you.

673
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Yeah.

674
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Buncher or for...

675
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Was it scruncher or a folder?

676
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
That's what you want to know.

677
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
You should just end it.

678
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Whenever you call in on the show, just end with, you know, instead of saying, hey,

679
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
you know, see you just say folder by by or scruncher.

680
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Just so we know what kind of person you are.

681
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,400
And I want to find out what kind of people are scrunchers.

682
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
I think scrunchers are a little bit in the hurry.

683
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Yeah, that could be.

684
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
And...

685
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
I take my time.

686
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
I just take their time.

687
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I take my time.

688
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Make sure they're clean.

689
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
There's something like that.

690
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
I even appreciate the pre-fold.

691
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
For serious.

692
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
The pre-fold, I really like.

693
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
That's what they do when they clean the condo.

694
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Oh, yeah.

695
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
They fold the little point in the toilet paper.

696
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
I love that.

697
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I love that.

698
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
And nothing.

699
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
This condo.

700
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
No, this is a cottage.

701
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Don't get me started on the help you selected and continue to maintain.

702
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I mean, I've told you many a time.

703
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I select that because she's spooked like that.

704
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Yeah, but she walks.

705
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
She talks like that.

706
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
I'm not.

707
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I'm not.

708
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Maybe she cleans like that.

709
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
That's not true.

710
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Not true.

711
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
So I just want to know that Sid Barrett passed away yesterday.

712
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Of course, that was all over the new Sid Barrett of Pink Floyd.

713
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
That was Floyd.

714
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I walked this morning to, it was an Emily.

715
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Was that the name in the song.

716
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Yeah.

717
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Yeah.

718
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,400
That was on BBC 2.

719
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
So, 60 years old way to young.

720
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Yeah.

721
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
But he was definitely what they say in the financial time.

722
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,400
So they the the the Icarus of Britain psychedelic pop music and he just got too

723
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
close to the song or what.

724
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
But I don't know what he died of.

725
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
I don't know actually I didn't do.

726
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,380
It didn't say it or at least I didn't read the permission.

727
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:52,380
I think if you live that way that they did, I mean, you have to somewhere. It's shortens your life and they, you know all the bad.

728
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:59,380
Well, that is true. I mean, all the people we know that were hard-ass rock and rollers all seemed to go somewhere between 50 and 60.

729
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,380
Yeah, 55 seems to be pretty much like Alfa.

730
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
A little bit too much of something.

731
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
It's not good.

732
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
I guess too much of anything. It's not good.

733
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Yeah, I think about it.

734
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,380
Well, no. A lot of sex is good.

735
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,380
No, no, too much cannot be good for you.

736
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
For me?

737
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,380
No, for anybody. You can't have too much sex.

738
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,380
No, no, no.

739
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,380
No, no, no.

740
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
That can also be bad.

741
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Oh.

742
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,380
I thought it was a good attitude.

743
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
That's a good idea.

744
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
The idea is very appealing.

745
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
Yeah.

746
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,380
Those of you checking us out on serious stars 102.

747
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,380
The pod show is just getting started.

748
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,380
We have a Pacific Coast Hellway coming up after this show and that will be followed up all the way.

749
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,380
Until 10 o'clock Eastern time.

750
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,380
As you do every single week day evening on serious stars 102.

751
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
And if you want to hear the rest of the show with the lady Patricia

752
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Go to dailysourcecode.com.

753
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,380
So what else do you got?

754
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,380
I'm disappointed.

755
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,380
And what?

756
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,380
I'm thinking about it.

757
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,380
I thought that I always read sex is good for you.

758
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,380
Oh, it is, but too much of anything is not good for you.

759
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,380
Come on.

760
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,380
You can actually physically harm yourself if you have too much sex.

761
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,380
Oh, and you mean like exaggerated.

762
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,380
Well, what are you talking about?

763
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,380
Like four times a day?

764
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,380
No, I don't mean like, you know, doing dull day because I sometimes hear that.

765
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,380
I would have a heart attack if I had to four times a day.

766
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,380
And of course, you know, that's not very good for you skin.

767
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,380
No.

768
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,380
Down there.

769
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,380
No, no.

770
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,380
I mean just in a normal way.

771
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,380
Like, you know, having fun with it.

772
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Yeah, like last night.

773
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
I know.

774
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,380
Yeah.

775
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,380
I think it's very good.

776
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
And it's good for my heart.

777
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,380
Oh, yeah.

778
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,380
Mine too.

779
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Keep the heart to go.

780
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,380
Keep the heart pumping.

781
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,380
Pumping.

782
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
Hmm.

783
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,380
See, got anything?

784
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,380
Anything.

785
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
I mean, I got lots of stuff too.

786
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
Pumping for low.

787
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,380
I got lots of stuff to talk about.

788
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
Do you?

789
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,380
Did you come to the show prepared, I guess, is one of my asking?

790
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
No, never.

791
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
No, you're not fantastic.

792
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
You know that.

793
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,380
But whatever you want to talk about, I'm ready.

794
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,380
I have some things I got to do there.

795
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,380
We're into the final round of the earth link.

796
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,380
Yeah.

797
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,380
Add challenge.

798
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,380
You want to hear this.

799
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,380
This is one of the finalists.

800
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
You might have heard this one before.

801
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,380
So this is going to be voted on by the judges, which is basically, you make the commercial

802
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
if you know.

803
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
So goddamn good.

804
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,380
That's basically what the project is.

805
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
Yeah.

806
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,380
Yeah.

807
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,380
We're doing the earthly clues.

808
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,380
That's right, baby.

809
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,380
Earthlink.

810
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,380
Bombastic broadband.

811
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,380
Delicious, darling.

812
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
That's Earthlink.

813
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,380
Earthlink comes home to you and brings it home to Mama.

814
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
That's your idea, sister.

815
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
That's what I'm talking about.

816
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,380
In Earthlink, to help you out with all your internet needs.

817
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,380
It's just good.

818
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,380
Earthlink.com.

819
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,380
Let them know that papa sits in.

820
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,380
Yeah.

821
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,380
That's your idea.

822
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,380
That's what I'm talking about.

823
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,380
So that would be in the song category.

824
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
Yeah.

825
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,380
So we got more coming over the next couple weeks.

826
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,380
You can now listen to all the finalists at adchallenge.podshow.com.

827
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
I don't know what you can talk about.

828
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,380
Listen to this.

829
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Hi Adam.

830
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,380
This is Alex calling you from Afghanistan.

831
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,380
I just.

832
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,380
From Afghanistan.

833
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,380
Just heard the resource quote about your mom.

834
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,380
I want to give you my condolences and see your family.

835
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,380
And take care.

836
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,380
And know what we tried to get you over here.

837
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,380
Just like you did a couple of years ago.

838
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,380
I was a Dutch in Iraq.

839
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,380
Yeah, okay.

840
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,380
How about that, huh?

841
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
Yeah.

842
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,380
I would go.

843
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,380
You know I would go.

844
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,380
Yeah, I know.

845
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,380
But I wouldn't just do podcasts.

846
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,380
I do streaming audio so that you could listen to it live as well.

847
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,380
God, I would love to go.

848
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,380
I really think that would be awesome.

849
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,380
Isn't it amazing that everybody's still there?

850
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,380
The problem is still there.

851
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
Well, yeah.

852
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,380
Well, the problem is it's all over the world, baby.

853
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,380
I mean, did you see what happened yesterday?

854
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
It starts in India.

855
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
Yeah.

856
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
Fucking hell.

857
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,380
Yeah.

858
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,380
There were hundreds of hundred and ninety people blown to bits.

859
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
Three hundred injured.

860
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,380
They still don't know who they don't know.

861
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,380
Yeah.

862
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,380
But isn't it interesting?

863
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Did you have a different field?

864
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,380
Do you think that when we read about something that happens in India?

865
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,380
Yeah.

866
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,380
Which is actually, you know, I know a lot of people from India, which I was bringing

867
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,380
someone closer to me, but it feels so far away.

868
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,380
Do you think that when the London bombings took place or in Madrid?

869
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,380
Yeah.

870
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,380
Do you think that people in India had the same feeling?

871
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,380
I wonder.

872
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,380
What do you think?

873
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,380
I think so.

874
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,380
Because really, I mean, we think.

875
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Well, you know, if something happens, really close to you, of course, it's a

876
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
different experience.

877
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,380
Of course, you know, it's so close.

878
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
You think I could have been there.

879
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,380
But so here's today's world where a guy just called me from Afghanistan.

880
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,380
Yeah.

881
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
And he feels pretty close.

882
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
Yeah.

883
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,380
And India doesn't feel like something incredibly far away country because I know a lot

884
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,380
of people from India.

885
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,380
I know people who travel back and forth all the time, who travel through London.

886
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,380
Yeah.

887
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,380
But still that it feels somewhat removed in it.

888
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,380
And it's the same problem.

889
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
I always think about it.

890
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Especially when I see the pictures, I always really stare at it and read it.

891
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,380
And I think, oh my God, you know, that must be horrible.

892
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,380
If you're family or anything or you're child.

893
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,380
I just like the point out that I do not, I do not believe India is fighting

894
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
Iraq right now.

895
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,380
I just like the point out.

896
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
No.

897
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
And I'm very curious.

898
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
What is this all about?

899
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,380
Well, India has multiple religions living side by side.

900
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
Yeah.

901
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,380
Christians, Buddhists, Muslims.

902
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,380
You know, there's always been huge tension between India and Pakistan.

903
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,380
You know, there's a lot going on over there too.

904
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
Of course.

905
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,380
But terrorism is terrorism.

906
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,380
It's moment.

907
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,380
I just, who, who, who was this?

908
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
Who is responsible?

909
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,380
Did anyone claim it?

910
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,380
No, not yet.

911
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,380
You sure?

912
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,380
No one claimed it.

913
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
Then how do they know it?

914
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Well, I guess they know it's terrorist attack.

915
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
They, they too.

916
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
Suicide bombers.

917
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,380
That's what they think.

918
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,380
Yeah.

919
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,380
We know so little actually.

920
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
And we're so quick to believe what we're told.

921
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
Yeah, yeah.

922
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,380
I mean, I catch myself time and time again doing that.

923
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,380
I just like why do I believe everything immediately?

924
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
Yeah.

925
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,380
So we got two new shows coming.

926
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,380
In the next two weeks, one of them will talk about what you listened to last night.

927
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,380
I want to talk about that in a second.

928
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,380
But now, there's all this is new.

929
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
I'm not going to show what it is.

930
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,380
But it's a show where two people compete against each other.

931
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
And you know, PWB.

932
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,380
Mm-hmm.

933
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,380
Sidelight repairman.

934
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,380
I'm just saying.

935
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

936
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:39,380
So now he is competing against CC Chapman.

937
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,380
And you didn't hear yesterday because of course.

938
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
You don't listen to the show.

939
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,380
But PWB said he was like, is it like a really angry?

940
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,380
And like, I'm going to slap CC Chapman down.

941
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,380
And now CC sent in the following comment.

942
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,380
Hey, Adam, it's CC.

943
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,380
Okay.

944
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,380
So I hear this crap from PWB on the show.

945
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,380
And I don't know what's going on here.

946
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,380
You know, Mark, you know, Yoshimoto there says, Yo dude, you know what you guys come

947
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,380
on this game show.

948
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
We're going to do a thing.

949
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
We're going to do a thing.

950
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
We're going to have some fun.

951
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,380
You're going to be a bone.

952
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,380
I don't like it.

953
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
I get this actually on you.

954
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
And it's all good, man.

955
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
Whatever.

956
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
And you know, Mark's my boy.

957
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,380
So I said, yes, sure, whatever.

958
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
We can do that.

959
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,380
And, and then also in PWB's first talk in this trash.

960
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
I mean, you know, he's an old guy.

961
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,380
You know, he gets a little crazy sometimes and goes up the handle.

962
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,380
You know, he doesn't really, he really, really hates the Uncle Jesse stuff.

963
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,380
Um, but if he starts to trash talking, then he sends crap to you.

964
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,380
I mean, I thought it was just an innocent blog post.

965
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,380
I'm like, you know, whatever, man, that's cool.

966
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
You know, I'm just, I'm the easy girl.

967
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,380
I'm the, it's all good guy.

968
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,380
And then thin goes and does all those stuff, man.

969
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
So, you know, I just, you know, PWB, you know,

970
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,380
I don't, you know, I just want a truth, you know, white flag man, you know.

971
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,380
I don't want to get on the show and just totally have the bitch slap.

972
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,380
Some old guys weren't depends on, you know, a podcast around the world.

973
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,380
Come on, dude.

974
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,380
I thought we were friends, man.

975
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,380
You know what I mean?

976
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,380
Yeah, I'd give you an ass, weapon, and, you know,

977
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,380
I'd beat you over the hip.

978
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
Sorry.

979
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,380
I just wanted to, you know, because I know, you know,

980
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,380
people think you know, PWB and our friends,

981
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,380
and I thought I was too, and then all this happened.

982
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,380
So, you know, I had about, I don't know what's going on next.

983
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,380
You know, I just, I wanted to retort, I guess,

984
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,380
after I heard PWB on the show today.

985
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,380
I don't know.

986
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,380
I guess we'll find out when bone comes out, you know,

987
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,380
what happens, and, you know, hopefully,

988
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,380
PWB and I can work as shit out, you know, because, you know,

989
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
I love the man.

990
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
I don't know.

991
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
Whatever.

992
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,380
Hey, have a good one.

993
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Good to have you back.

994
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,380
Talk to you, see you, man.

995
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,380
See you.

996
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,380
Oh, sounds are pretty fake, didn't it?

997
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,380
Yeah, you know, I know.

998
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,380
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

999
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,380
SmackDown, baby.

1000
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1001
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
I think it's a really interesting attempt

1002
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,380
of getting people to go to bone.pot show.com.

1003
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,380
Yeah, that's what he means.

1004
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,380
Uh-huh.

1005
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,380
I think so.

1006
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Real long way to promo it, but I do appreciate it.

1007
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Did you actually tell your listeners how incredible

1008
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,380
good it was to have a party at the end of your morning?

1009
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,380
I did.

1010
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
And it's our listeners, by the way.

1011
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
Oh, okay.

1012
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,380
Why don't you tell our listeners about it

1013
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,380
from your experience?

1014
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,380
Because when Adam told me that his mom wanted a 50's party.

1015
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,380
Actually, you know what I have.

1016
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,380
I'm sorry to interrupt you, huh.

1017
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,380
I have the actual words.

1018
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
Yeah.

1019
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,380
That my mom had pre-written.

1020
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,380
Uh-huh.

1021
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,380
So this is actually on the, uh, what do you call this?

1022
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,380
Uh-huh.

1023
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,380
The announcement.

1024
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,380
Yeah.

1025
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,380
What do you call it in the announcement?

1026
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,380
Condolions.

1027
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,380
Condolions.

1028
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
Yeah, condolions.

1029
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Card.

1030
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,380
The death card.

1031
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,380
You know.

1032
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,380
Something like that.

1033
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,380
Yeah.

1034
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,380
So it has butterflies or free.

1035
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,380
With thanks to all of you for your love supporting

1036
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,380
guidance given to my wife and our mom.

1037
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,380
The cremation will take place in the presence of her immediate family members,

1038
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,380
her special wish was for us to give a 50's party in her memory.

1039
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,380
And we are honoring that request.

1040
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
And then, you know, a separate slip.

1041
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,380
Uh-huh.

1042
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,380
You were cordially invited to Valerie's 50's party.

1043
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
But that was literally what she wanted us.

1044
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
Yeah.

1045
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,380
Now I have to explain that your mom, I know her now for the long time.

1046
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:09,380
And it took me a while to understand her because she's so different than any other woman.

1047
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,380
And other.

1048
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,380
That feeling might have been mutual for a while.

1049
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,380
Yes.

1050
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
And especially being a mother-in-law.

1051
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,380
Now I'm mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws.

1052
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:25,380
You know, that is always a little bit of a difficulty because it's not your mom.

1053
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
And I'm not her daughter.

1054
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,380
Right.

1055
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,380
So it's different.

1056
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,380
And in the beginning, I thought, she's not an easy person.

1057
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,380
You know, she wants attention with this.

1058
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
In the beginning, it's like 20 years ago that we're talking.

1059
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
20 years ago, I try to understand it.

1060
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
It was very hard.

1061
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,380
She was checking me out, of course.

1062
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,380
She didn't like me in the beginning because she thought, an older woman.

1063
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,380
What is it?

1064
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,380
Robbing the cradle of her.

1065
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,380
Her own son.

1066
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,380
Maybe.

1067
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:56,380
And she had her dreams about, you know, maybe not children.

1068
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,380
Because she was not into babies and these sort of things.

1069
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,380
But I don't know what kind of plan she had for you.

1070
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,380
But so in the beginning, she looked at me like,

1071
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,380
Hmm.

1072
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,380
I don't know about this.

1073
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,380
And she really showed me that.

1074
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,380
You know, so it was very hard.

1075
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,380
I got to know her.

1076
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,380
We had a couple of fights.

1077
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
Remember that?

1078
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
Well, not really fights.

1079
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,380
You know, words.

1080
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,380
Words.

1081
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
Words.

1082
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Words.

1083
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,380
Where we finally said exactly.

1084
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
What I felt.

1085
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,380
How she felt.

1086
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
That I wasn't.

1087
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
I didn't agree with her.

1088
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
But her thinking.

1089
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
And we came actually very close to each other.

1090
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,380
We did understand each other.

1091
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,380
We were only 10 years apart.

1092
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,380
Hmm.

1093
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,380
You know.

1094
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,380
So at the end.

1095
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,380
When we talked on the phone, we really understood each other.

1096
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,380
It was very, very good.

1097
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,380
And two weeks ago actually two or two and a half weeks ago.

1098
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,380
She thanked me.

1099
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,380
For taking care of her son so well.

1100
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
And nobody else could have made you.

1101
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
That's a tough job.

1102
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
So happy.

1103
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
Taking care of my son.

1104
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,380
Yeah.

1105
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,380
Tough gig.

1106
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,380
Right.

1107
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,380
So how about the back to the party?

1108
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,380
Yeah.

1109
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,380
So when you told me that she wanted to have a 50's party, I thought,

1110
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,380
Oh, God.

1111
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,380
That she goes again.

1112
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,380
She wants something.

1113
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
You know, I'm not in the mood.

1114
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
It's going to cost a lot of money.

1115
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,380
We're going to invite our people in the mood for this.

1116
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,380
I thought she's crazy.

1117
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,380
I mean, she's, you know, she's coming up.

1118
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
You actually thought about how much it would cost.

1119
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
Yeah.

1120
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,380
Really?

1121
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
Yeah.

1122
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
I think about that for a second.

1123
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Yeah.

1124
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,380
I thought, oh, my God.

1125
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Because I know your parties.

1126
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,380
When you give a party.

1127
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,380
I give a party.

1128
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,380
It's a party.

1129
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,380
And then you come up with all those crazy things.

1130
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,380
Like the pink catalog.

1131
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Pink.

1132
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,380
Right.

1133
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,380
Exactly.

1134
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
So.

1135
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,380
I thought, oh, my God.

1136
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,380
This is, you know, he's going to go berserk.

1137
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,380
And.

1138
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,380
And so when the day was there.

1139
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:03,380
And after the ceremony of the kids standing there, around the,

1140
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,380
The coffin.

1141
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,380
And saying goodbye to her, which was very sad.

1142
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,380
Because I felt horrible for you guys.

1143
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,380
And, and I felt pain in Christina.

1144
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,380
And everybody was crying.

1145
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,380
And we couldn't believe it.

1146
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,380
Actually, that she was in there.

1147
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
Yeah.

1148
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,380
Because that's what you think.

1149
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,380
Oh, my God.

1150
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,380
She's laying in there.

1151
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,380
The poor woman is in a box.

1152
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
You know, you know.

1153
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,380
Because you know, of course, there's all kinds of images of my mom.

1154
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,380
Yeah.

1155
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,380
I have the hardest time still getting that.

1156
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
We're getting the image.

1157
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,380
The image of her last moments.

1158
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,380
Just not her last moment.

1159
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,380
But really that last day, you know.

1160
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,380
I just, I was.

1161
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,380
It was incredible to see what just for cancer can do to.

1162
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,380
It was that's hard.

1163
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,380
That's very hard.

1164
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
That's the hard thing.

1165
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,380
When you think, we go back to those final hours.

1166
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,380
We were all thinking about that.

1167
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
You know, everything goes through.

1168
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,380
That's what I was thinking about this fucking box.

1169
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,380
Yeah.

1170
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,380
And I'm being in a box.

1171
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,380
Who wants to be in a box?

1172
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
Yeah.

1173
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,380
I don't think she really liked the whole box thing.

1174
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,380
No, the box.

1175
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
No.

1176
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
Who came up with the box?

1177
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
Well, no.

1178
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,380
She already pre-ordered everything.

1179
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,380
No, I mean, long, long time ago, the people should be in a box.

1180
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,380
Okay.

1181
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,380
Who came over the box thing?

1182
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
Yeah, the box thing.

1183
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,380
Well, you know, lots of people burn their bodies.

1184
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,380
Yeah.

1185
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
Yeah.

1186
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,380
So throw me on some, you know, or ration torturing me or roll them in beautiful leaves

1187
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,380
and flowers and then let them just, you know.

1188
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,380
Torturing me smoke me.

1189
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,380
I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

1190
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,380
I'll be disappointed.

1191
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,380
But come to that party.

1192
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,380
And if I can't have a party today, I'm not in mood.

1193
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,380
So we all went to that lovely diner.

1194
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,380
Really looked from.

1195
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Catty's catty's diner.

1196
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Oh, yeah.

1197
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,380
It was absolutely.

1198
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,380
It was a beautiful hot summer day.

1199
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,380
Yeah.

1200
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,380
It almost looked like a mirror.

1201
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,380
The roll right up front and park in the front.

1202
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,380
It didn't look so good.

1203
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,380
It didn't look so good.

1204
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,380
It could smell the park where you could always talk to about.

1205
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,380
And that was a beautiful pink catty like.

1206
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,380
And convertible.

1207
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,380
I think that your mom had the greatest time.

1208
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,380
You know, because that's very young.

1209
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,380
Oh, yeah.

1210
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,380
Yeah.

1211
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,380
She loved that time.

1212
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,380
She loved it.

1213
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,380
Oh, yeah.

1214
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Absolutely.

1215
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,380
And it could hear the music from the do-box coming from inside.

1216
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,380
The smell of the hamburgers and the hot dogs and the milkshakes.

1217
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,380
And we had a great time.

1218
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
Wasn't that nice?

1219
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,380
It was such a beautiful sort of end of a sad day.

1220
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,380
Mm-hmm.

1221
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,380
And of course, it was sad.

1222
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,380
But in a little bit, it was like, it was healing.

1223
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,380
It was the beginning of the healing, I think, from most people.

1224
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,380
Exactly.

1225
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,380
Some people came by, you know, for four hours on multiple buses just to get there.

1226
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,380
Exactly.

1227
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,380
It was so pretty.

1228
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,380
Sweating and hot.

1229
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,380
But everybody was so happy.

1230
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,380
Yeah.

1231
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,380
And we all thought about her.

1232
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
We had wonderful stories about her.

1233
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,380
Yeah.

1234
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,380
And we all came together.

1235
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,380
Yeah.

1236
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,380
And it was a lot of wonderful idea.

1237
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
Yeah.

1238
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,380
It was a good idea.

1239
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,380
It was a good idea.

1240
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,380
And maybe this is a very good idea for other people.

1241
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
Because why?

1242
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,380
You are already said.

1243
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,380
It's deep in your heart.

1244
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,380
It will be there.

1245
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
And it hurts.

1246
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
It hurts like hell.

1247
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,380
But why?

1248
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
You know, just ended.

1249
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,380
And feeling even more crappy and crappy and...

1250
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,380
Yeah.

1251
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,380
And crappy and...

1252
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,380
Do you want speeches that you're a service?

1253
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,380
Because we didn't do any speeches.

1254
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,380
Which I thought was kind of nice.

1255
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
Because, you know, there was no...

1256
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Everyone could have their own conversations and...

1257
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,380
Yeah.

1258
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,380
Well, the speeches were...

1259
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,380
What we were talking to each other about her.

1260
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,380
Yeah.

1261
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,380
Much better.

1262
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,380
Because if you have a speech, it's always so unreal.

1263
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,380
Yeah.

1264
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,380
You know.

1265
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,380
You're always going to say something that you think...

1266
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,380
I actually don't mean it like that.

1267
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,380
Like what sounds so good.

1268
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,380
But it rhymes.

1269
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,380
But it sounds...

1270
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,380
It sounds so good.

1271
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,380
You know?

1272
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
And...

1273
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,380
Yeah, that's true.

1274
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,380
Yeah.

1275
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,380
That's true.

1276
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,380
And she...

1277
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,380
Your mom loved honesty.

1278
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,380
Oh, boy.

1279
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,380
She had the saying honor bright.

1280
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,380
Right.

1281
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,380
Like honor was something that was inside of you.

1282
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,380
And if you said, my honor is bright.

1283
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,380
And there was so clear in our family.

1284
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,380
You do not want honor bright.

1285
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,380
It was not an honor bright.

1286
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,380
No.

1287
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,380
Where she was.

1288
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,380
Oh, no.

1289
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,380
That's the way she was.

1290
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,380
She did threaten me to spank me with the hairbrush, bristle side down.

1291
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,380
Sometimes she said, I'll do it on the wooden side.

1292
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,380
Oh.

1293
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,380
Let's go.

1294
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,380
Let's go.

1295
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,380
Okay.

1296
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,380
So I had to...

1297
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,380
Because that thought it was a good idea.

1298
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,380
That was a good idea.

1299
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,380
In hindsight.

1300
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,380
Yeah.

1301
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,380
Absolutely.

1302
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,380
So last night we checked out...

1303
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,380
I almost felt like...

1304
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,380
Like a Hollywood producer.

1305
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,380
You know, we're...

1306
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,380
You have your own little movie theater.

1307
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,380
The...

1308
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,380
The Dailys of the New Masterpiece that your company's team is working on.

1309
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,380
And so...

1310
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,380
And I had not listened to it.

1311
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,380
Of course.

1312
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,380
We've been working on it.

1313
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,380
Well, I say we, but really pod show LA out in the shack.

1314
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,380
They're in Venice Beach.

1315
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,380
Mark Yoshimura Namcoff.

1316
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,380
And the...

1317
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,380
And the hell players.

1318
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,380
And the whole bunch of...

1319
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,380
Really talented actors from Hollywood have been working on this.

1320
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,380
And that has all been doing it, you know, in the new style.

1321
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,380
Which means, come on.

1322
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,380
Let's just get a fucking Mac and throw it together.

1323
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,380
And we'll pay everybody.

1324
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,380
Did you?

1325
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,380
What a concept.

1326
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
And it's a...

1327
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,380
A drama.

1328
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,380
An audio drama.

1329
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,380
Yeah.

1330
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,380
And you have to listen to it.

1331
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,380
You just dim the lights a little bit.

1332
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,380
And then sit back.

1333
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,380
Have a cup of tea or a glass of wine.

1334
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,380
And just let your fantasy.

1335
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,380
Let's play the promo for a second.

1336
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,380
Do the thing.

1337
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,380
Let's get people into the mood for a second.

1338
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,380
Here.

1339
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,380
All not.

1340
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,380
See.

1341
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,380
This is working.

1342
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,380
A bit down.

1343
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,380
Of shadow falls.

1344
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,380
All the secrets are more clear to protect.

1345
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,380
And others will die to expose.

1346
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:38,380
For it is on this ground that the prelude to Armageddon has been battle over for more than 300 years.

1347
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,380
This time, it will be decided.

1348
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,380
Once.

1349
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,380
Actful.

1350
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,380
Coming soon to headphones near you.

1351
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,380
For every light that shines.

1352
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,380
A shadow falls.

1353
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,380
To be amongst the chosen pre-register, a shadow falls.

1354
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,380
Don't go.

1355
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
Coming to their headphones.

1356
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,380
Near you.

1357
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,380
Near you.

1358
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,380
I like that.

1359
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,380
Yeah.

1360
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,380
Where's the voice, huh?

1361
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,380
Oh, my God.

1362
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,380
Isn't that great?

1363
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,380
This is so good.

1364
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,380
I love that thing.

1365
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
I think he's a waiter.

1366
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,380
You're kidding.

1367
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,380
Could be our fishman.

1368
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Oh, yeah.

1369
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,380
Yeah.

1370
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,380
He's got a good voice.

1371
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,380
Dude, come on up here and be part of the show.

1372
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,380
So we're listening to it.

1373
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,380
He's good.

1374
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,380
I got to say, I was just, I was like, whoa, this is good.

1375
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,380
She was great writing.

1376
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,380
Great story.

1377
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,380
Great.

1378
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,380
Great acting.

1379
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,380
Or you have to see it like you don't have to read.

1380
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
You're just listening.

1381
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,380
Well, I've heard stuff on the BBC.

1382
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,380
It's not even half as good as what this is.

1383
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,380
Yeah.

1384
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,380
I mean, it's really, you can find it.

1385
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,380
I guess they have the room up now.

1386
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Shadowfalls.podshow.com.

1387
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,380
So it's coming.

1388
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
Well, listen to the BBC world.

1389
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,380
Yeah.

1390
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,380
And they have dramas.

1391
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,380
But this is so good.

1392
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,380
It's rich with sound effects.

1393
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,380
And we didn't listen to it on earphones.

1394
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,380
We listened to it just on big speakers with a bass reflex and cuts.

1395
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,380
That sounded good.

1396
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Yeah.

1397
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,380
Now to be able to see world has more like.

1398
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,380
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

1399
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,380
Yeah.

1400
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,380
Exactly.

1401
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,380
So there's a theme song to our drama series Shadow Falls.

1402
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,380
And I think you should listen to it because it's out now.

1403
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
And available on the pod save music network.

1404
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,380
From monk.

1405
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,380
I am.

1406
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,380
It's Molly's theme.

1407
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:38,380
I just became.

1408
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,380
I was dead for her.

1409
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:51,380
For us to be, that's means both ways.

1410
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,380
You've never asked my name.

1411
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,380
I am here.

1412
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,380
I am here.

1413
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,380
I am here.

1414
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,380
You'll see.

1415
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,380
I am late.

1416
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,380
I am naive.

1417
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:17,380
I am fearful of crazy.

1418
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:27,380
I am here.

1419
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:35,380
I am here.

1420
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,380
I am here.

00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,380
I am here.

1422
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:47,380
I am here.

1423
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
For my same.

1424
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,380
For every life that shines.

1425
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,380
Shadow Falls.

1426
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,380
I am here.

1427
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,380
I am here.

1428
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,380
I am there.

1429
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,380
You'll see.

1430
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,380
I am alive.

1431
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,380
I am naive.

1432
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,380
I am fearful of crazy.

1433
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:24,380
I am here.

1434
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,380

I am here.

1438
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,380
I am here.

1439
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,380
I am here.

1440
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,380
I am here.

1441
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,380
I am here.

00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,380
I am here.

1462
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,380
I am not awesome.

1463
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:33,380
I think you will like this production.

1464
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,380
I am so proud of it.

1465
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,380
I expect Michael Jackson to come with something like that.

1466
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,380
It is so interesting you said that because when I was listening because the way the first episode goes

1467
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,380
into the song.

1468
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1469
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1470
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1471
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1472
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1473
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1474
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1475
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1476
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1477
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1478
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1479
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1480
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1481
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1482
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1483
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1484
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1485
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1486
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1487
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1488
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1489
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1490
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1491
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,380
It reminded me of Michael Jackson.

1492
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,380
What do you think she said?

1493
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,380
Some people are not even legal and a 40.

1494
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,380
What do you think she means?

1495
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,380
I'm legal.

1496
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,380
Now I'm legal.

1497
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,380
So that's all she wanted.

1498
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,380
Are partying?

1499
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,380
Yes, she wants a party.

1500
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,380
She wants to go to Disneyland.

1501
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,380
Dad, I like Paris.

1502
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,380
So we're going to go.

1503
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,380
I'm going to go to San Francisco next week and then after that we'll go to Paris.

1504
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,380
That's a long time.

1505
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,380
You're right.

1506
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,380
It's nice.

1507
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,380
Yeah.

1508
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,380
The nice Disney hotels always fun.

1509
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,380
Christina can stay in a room with a girlfriend and you and I can have goofy sex.

1510
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,380
In our own suite.

1511
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,380
Goofy.

1512
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,380
We can we can invite him.

1513
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,380
Goofy hot.

1514
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,380
He's a long nose.

1515
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,380
He's saying Goofy is a folder or scruncher.

1516
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,380
And Goofy has his big long nose with a big black knob.

1517
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,380
Yes.

1518
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,380
The knob.

1519
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,380
The knob.

1520
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,380
Goofy.

1521
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,380
So that's what she wants.

1522
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,380
And she wants a Chanel bag.

1523
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,380
Look at the Chanel bag.

1524
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,380
I don't even have a Chanel bag.

1525
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,380
Yeah, you're legal.

1526
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,380
Here's a goofy knob.

1527
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,380
The Chanel bag.

1528
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,380
Please.

1529
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,380
Ah, please.

1530
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,380
I didn't know.

1531
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,380
You can't have it all done.

1532
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,380
Darling.

1533
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,380
But that's, you know, that's what she knows.

1534
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,380
That's because of MTV.

1535
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,380
No, that's not MTV.

1536
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,380
That's half the magazines you drag into the house or fill with a crab.

1537
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,380
It doesn't mean you have to buy it.

1538
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,380
No, but it's.

1539
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,380
You can look at it and enjoy it.

1540
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,380
It's just.

1541
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,380
Yeah.

1542
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,380
Whatever.

1543
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,380
But I'm from a different generation.

1544
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,380
Yes, you are.

1545
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,380
We enjoy these things.

1546
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,380
Just look at it.

1547
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,380
We don't have to.

1548
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,380
You actually have to own it.

1549
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,380
No, you don't.

1550
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,380
I don't understand the, the whole appeal of having.

1551
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,380
The sunglasses.

1552
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,380
I understand.

1553
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,380
Because you don't have to have, you know, if you have the same sunglasses, someone else,

1554
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,380
then it's actually not cool.

1555
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,380
But this whole idea of having the same bag.

1556
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,380
And it's just to say, I could afford it.

1557
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,380
Is that what it is?

1558
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,380
Or.

1559
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,380
I mean, yeah, particularly if you have it at the right moment.

1560
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,380
What do you think that's it?

1561
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,380
Yeah, you're making a statement.

1562
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,380
So that's that's horrible.

1563
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,380
Yeah.

1564
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,380
They're really used.

1565
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,380
Because that's what they see in all those magazines.

1566
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,380
You see those stars.

1567
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,380
I understand.

1568
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,380
Okay.

1569
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,380
So it's a good formulation.

1570
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,380
No, because this bag thing is different.

1571
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,380
It is about having the right bag at the right time with the right dog.

1572
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,380
With the right dog and the right cell phone.

1573
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,380
You got to have the right cell phone.

1574
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,380
Right cell phone.

1575
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,380
And if you have all that, then it's just like, but it's always been a little bit like this.

1576
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:57,380
Because you know, it's all those accessories, but using years ago, was having the right car.

1577
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,380
For example.

1578
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,380
Oh, that's true.

1579
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,380
You know, so it's all right.

1580
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,380
Yeah.

1581
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,380
Yeah, you had to have the right limo.

1582
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,380
So it is all about showing some form of wealth of success or something.

1583
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,380
It is.

1584
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,380
Oh yeah.

1585
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,380
It's your version as the women's version of a penis extender.

1586
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,380
Yeah.

1587
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,380
It is.

1588
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,380
Yeah.

1589
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,380
Yeah.

1590
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,380
Yeah.

1591
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,380
I don't really care about that.

1592
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,380
But I think if you are a beautiful.

1593
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:27,380
You have a certain personality and when you come in the room, and you have to do it.

1594
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,380
First, I think not the bag.

1595
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,380
Not the bag.

1596
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,380
Not the shoes.

1597
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,380
You know.

1598
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,380
And I think that's where they're making a mistake.

1599
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,380
Right.

1600
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:39,380
And if you see those movie stars, some of them just have it.

1601
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,380
Yeah.

1602
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,380
It doesn't matter if they have a postal bag or, you know.

1603
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,380
Well, I'm just about done with it though with this whole bag stuff.

1604
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,380
I just don't.

1605
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,380
I love bags because you can put so much in it.

1606
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,380
So, you know, I always have the whole thing with me.

1607
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,380
Yeah.

1608
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,380
Yeah.

1609
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,380
I like that.

1610
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,380
But you go out and you actually find bags that in themselves become trends.

1611
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,380
And you're pretty impressed with that.

1612
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,380
Yeah.

1613
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,380
Like the one you got was it to Karen Millen?

1614
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,380
No.

1615
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,380
No, no, no, no.

1616
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,380
No.

1617
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,380
The one you got to...

1618
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,380
The one you got to...

1619
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,380
TK Max.

1620
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,380
They have a whole bunch of wonderful bags.

1621
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,380
TK Max is the British version of TJ Max.

1622
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,380
TJ Max.

1623
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,380
Yeah, I love that.

1624
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,380
Fantastic.

1625
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,380
No, it doesn't matter.

1626
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,380
You know, it doesn't matter.

1627
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,380
Sometimes you can enjoy something that's really cheap and you're happy with it.

1628
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,380
That's true.

1629
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,380
I mean, that's, you know.

1630
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,380
Okay.

1631
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,380
It's not about that.

1632
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,380
Hey, well, I got shit to do.

1633
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,380
Oh, sorry about that.

1634
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,380
All right.

1635
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,380
So you've been so busy.

1636
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,380
Yeah, right.

1637
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,380
And it's not over yet.

1638
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,380
I got to...

1639
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,380
But I can see you enjoying yourself.

1640
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,380
I'm having a lot of fun.

1641
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,380
That's good.

1642
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,380
Yeah.

1643
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,380
That's a lot of fun.

1644
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,380
It's amazing.

1645
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,380
Look at the hell.

1646
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,380
Look at what's happening.

1647
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,380
Look at what has happened.

1648
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:55,380
We've become so used to podcasts reaching people all over the world and the interaction.

1649
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,380
And all these, you know, all these experiences and how new music is playing into it.

1650
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,380
This has only been going on for two years.

1651
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,380
Look how you swear to it.

1652
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,380
Nobody.

1653
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,380
You know.

1654
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,380
But every day, I'm like, wow, I can't believe I get to do this.

1655
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,380
Wow.

1656
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,380
I see what happened in the short time.

1657
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,380
My God.

1658
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,380
Yeah.

1659
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,380
When I used to play with the real-to-real tape decks.

1660
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,380
Yeah.

1661
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,380
In my room is a boy.

1662
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,380
You know, it's like, that was the dream.

1663
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,380
Yeah.

1664
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,380
I could have known a little studio here.

1665
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,380
And that's what I got.

1666
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,380
Yeah.

1667
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,380
I got it.

1668
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,380
And it's still a mess.

1669
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,380
Well, we, I remember my, my dad and I always play with our Ray Fox.

1670
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,380
Yeah.

1671
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,380
It's real-to-real.

1672
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,380
Yeah.

1673
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,380
Sure.

1674
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,380
You know, and we taped and we did.

1675
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,380
And now.

1676
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,380
You do some echo.

1677
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,380
Dubbed.

1678
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,380
Dubbed.

1679
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,380
That's right.

1680
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,380
Downsing bouncing from channels.

1681
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,380
A lot of fun.

1682
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,380
Cutting with a razor blade.

1683
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,380
Yeah.

1684
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,380
Yeah.

1685
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,380
Yeah.

1686
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,380
Yeah.

1687
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,380
Good times.

1688
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,380
All right.

1689
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,380
Now we're officially old and foggy.

1690
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,380
Yeah.

1691
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,380
All right.

1692
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,380
So you want to come tomorrow?

1693
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,380
Uh, right.

1694
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,380
Depends on if I, if I'm doing something more.

1695
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,380
I'm so sorry.

1696
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,380
That'd be so appreciated.

1697
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,380
All right.

1698
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,380
Thank you very much, Lady Patricia.

1699
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,380
