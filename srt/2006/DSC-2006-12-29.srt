pay three bucks a gallon for our guests.

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Last year was a real humdinger,

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Paris Hill thinks she's a singer.

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Hope next year is better than the last.

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Hope next year is better than the last.

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Mark Dolly's I am in congressional pages asking for picks and what their ages.

25
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,640
A lot of elections were uncontested because half a congress scout arrested.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Approval ratings are down for bus,

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
doesn't seem to know as head from his touch.

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
The president may not be too brave, but he's smart enough not to hunt with

29
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Cheney.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Last year was a real humdinger,

Paris Hill thinks she's a singer.

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Polarized caps are melting fast.

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Last year was a lot of crap all the dealing

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
with the eye-a-toolers.

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Hope this year is better than the last.

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,440
everything to fuck up, but it's okay. And we got a good show for you today. A little bit

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,360
later than normal, but of course I spent a little bit of time preparing because I wanted

55
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,760
to do some 2007 media entertainment predictions for you. Everyone loves to look back at the

56
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,760
predict, you know, I looked back for my predictions from last year and I don't think I did any.

57
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,200
I certainly didn't do any on the weblog. I had to go into the way back machine at archive.org

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,080
to find my old weblog because of course the archives are all busted and broken through the

59
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,080
numerous moves and shifts to servers. No, no reason for it other than just complete chaos from

60
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,880
my domain name management systems. But I didn't find, yeah, I found one, I found a podcast

61
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,800
from the 30th of December 2006 daily source code. It was like episode 320 or something like that

62
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,760
where I was talking about comic strip blogger who would put a number of predictions for 2006 on

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,200
as a list and one of them was that Pod Show would be acquired by Yahoo. No, he said Ron Blumen

64
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,280
Adam Curry will sell Pod Show to Yahoo or AOL for $400 million. And I was laughing at it then

65
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,880
and still am CSB. But thank you very much for opening up the show. Very helpful.

66
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,880
So I got some of those for you. And of course, you know a final final thought of the week should

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,520
be final thought of the year and it won't really be a final thought. It'll be more like a looking

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,080
forward. What have I learned from 2006? Great news in the New York Times. It was, um,

69
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,760
see yesterday. Of course, you'll find a link in the show notes of this. Um, about the Marie Claire

70
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,560
mast head. And I think I've told you about this previously, but Marie Claire, which is a very

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,280
famous women's magazine, um, has a podcast. You can find it at Marie Claire dot pod show dot com

72
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:24,560
M-A-R-I-C-L-A-I-R-E. Marie Claire dot pod show dot com. It's called the mast head. And it's,

73
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,480
I'm very proud of this. It launches January 2nd. So you can already see a trailer online as a promo

74
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:38,160
clip and some background information. Um, it's, it's, if you saw the devil wears Prada,

75
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,320
then you'll recognize some of it. Only it's real life. And as we follow, um, the editors around

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,560
of Marie Claire, um, which, of course, deals a lot mainly with fashion. I should say lifestyle

77
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,920
and fashion. And this editor, editor and chief, she's fantastic. This British woman. She's so made

78
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,880
for the part. Really spot on. Um, so anyway, read the, the article in New York Times, um, and,

79
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,800
and then check out the trailer. And you might as well get the show because when it comes out

80
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,040
on the second of January, I think I, I think you're really going to like it. I showed it to my

81
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,600
own personal little test audience here, which consists of the left hand side of the spectrum,

82
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,880
Christina 16 and a half years old, and the right hand side of the spectrum Patricia 57 years old.

83
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,040
And guess what? Score on both points. Um, see what was in the news. Saddam Hussein.

84
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,480
So this is something I don't really understand. So the guy is going to be executed. He's been,

85
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,760
um, he's been sentenced to hanging to death by hanging instead of any other quote, Hugh

86
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,720
Maine way, um, because it then equates him with the common criminal. And I presume that, you know,

87
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,200
this is an Iraqi thing, because I don't think it came out of the, uh, the war crimes court in the

88
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,000
haig. Um, and it has to by some strange laws. It's very hard to get, you know, to get the truth

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,800
out of newspapers. Again, the only truth in the newspapers is in the advertising. It's very hard

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,760
to find out what really is the full story. But apparently what I've extrapolated is that the sentence

91
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:25,200
has to be carried out within 30 days. And, um, it could even happen as soon as the next couple of days.

92
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,000
But now, and here's the thing I don't understand. It's going to be done in, you know, in like some

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,720
closed off secret place. And, and, you know, Krike, look at what we've gone through in Iraq.

94
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,040
Look at all that's happened. Look at all the coverage we have. Look at, I mean, even though

95
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:49,120
governments have really tried to stop, um, the images of our soldiers coming home, um, in boxes.

96
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,560
You know, there's still there's so much horror to be seen and so much horror to be felt. I mean,

97
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,040
why don't we make this a prime time special? Where's Haraldo in Iraq when you really need him?

98
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,120
You know, let's show the world what it really means to hang someone. You know, I really don't

99
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
understand why this is going to be hidden away. I don't like that at all. I think if, if we're going to

100
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,080
do this and if, you know, because no one is saying stop the execution. You know, so let's see it.

101
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,920
I think the public deserves to see it. I really, really believe in that.

102
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,600
Hey, if you don't want to watch it, you don't have to. But, you know, that would, that would really,

103
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,400
you know, it's like we're, we're so in the middle ages, still, you know, shooting hot

104
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,120
LED each other in a fucking desert. But yet when it comes to the hanging of, uh, of a criminal,

105
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,880
who killed thousands of people, oh, well, you know, we don't want to, that would be too shocking. We

106
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,800
don't want to see it. Bullshit, I say. I say, put that shit on the air. Prime time.

107
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,800
I don't know who this is, but put shit on that hole. Okay, message received.

108
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,080
Hey, Adam, this is Scott up here in Alaska. Did you know a band in the Pods eight music network

109
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,240
is going to be starting off this new year for the United States or anybody else who's going to

110
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,000
be tuning into NBC's New Year's Eve party, which is going to be hosted with Carson Daily at Time Square

111
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,560
New York. Yeah, that's right. Their panic at the disco and from their CD, a fevery

112
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,520
can't sweat out. This is our song, a time to dance. Happy New Year, Guy, and everybody else here

113
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,040
on the Daily Source code.

114
00:10:50,560 --> 00:11:20,560

116
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,980
Give me, give me, give me, I'll explain it, give me, we're life

117
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,260
Shotgun, you say what I need

118
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,360
Shotgun, what we shotgun, what we need

119
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,360
We'll see it choose this role

120
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,860
It's a boy and make it seem too slow

121
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,060
Come here, come here, come here

122
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,060
Cry

Remember we did from the tears and the teeth right out

124
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,760
To the vibe

125
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
I'd better be

126
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
For so many boys

127
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Highly in the edge of the midnight

128
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,760
But we hope for change

129
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Change

130
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,760

Come here, come here

187
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,200
Patricia said a headphones got a real nice set of AKGs, which he tried out. She said she loved it.

188
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,520
She loved the sound and well, probably she had all kinds of stuff to do today. So I couldn't

189
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,000
couldn't drag her in. I'm sorry. I'm sure we'll have some kind of recordings over the next two

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,240
weeks during the moves. We also went to to check out our our stuff yesterday. As the famous

191
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
George Carlin once said, when it's your things, it's your stuff and when it's someone else's

192
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,440
things, it's their shit. And so we looked at it with both eyes. At the stuff side and the

193
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,160
shit side, boy, we had stuff in storage or shit in storage for so long. Over two years and stuff

194
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,320
has just kind of like rotten away. You know what? Besides, I don't know, there must have been 15 boxes

195
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,760
full of admin, which of course you have to slap a slap around for seven years of your life in

196
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,920
case the taxes decide to audit something. And boy, I'm happy I've always slept that stuff around

197
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,600
because I've had many and all of it. But we also found I think at least a thousand. You know,

198
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,280
the, you know, the CD, the Patricia made for her for a cosmetics company with four tracks on it.

199
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,040
And I've played a couple of them, Misty for me, Foggy Day in London town. Two others, which

200
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,320
escaped me at the moment. Well, I think we have a thousand of those completely new in the box.

201
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,120
I mean, I had no idea. I thought we were completely out of stock. So we're going to do something

202
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,320
with that in 2007. I definitely want to give them away or maybe even better sell them and then

203
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,920
give them money to charity. It's really, it's a nice CD. And, you know, the number of people who

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,400
listen, I'm sure at least a thousand would like to have a CD buyer. So that's something that we

205
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,200
found was pretty interesting. What are all these heavy fucking boxes? Oh my God, it's CDs,

206
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,640
the ones we thought we didn't have anymore of. And my face is a little bit reconfigured finally.

207
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Well, actually, the face is still kind of the same. But somewhere around mid, mid morning today,

208
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,640
the penicillin finally kicked in. And, you know, penicillin makes me a thar jick and, you know,

209
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,960
and sometimes little scratchy and itchy, there's, oh, you know, I think everyone has probably

210
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,360
some light form of allergic reaction. Maybe you might not even notice it. But this isn't heavy

211
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,840
ass shit. And I've got like two separate boxes. And one of them I have to take four times a day with

212
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,640
eight at six hour intervals and the other one three times a day at eight hour intervals. And that

213
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,400
does require quite a bit of that administration. Thank God for for Google account. Really makes

214
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,840
a big difference. Still love to hear from you. You know the number by now, I hope.

215
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,520
Now, I'm hoping that by the time I get my studio set up in the new in the new cottage that I'll

216
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,640
be able to create a couple of my own best of Charlie's. I have about five slots left. If you

217
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,800
want to create a best of Charlie, 24 minutes and 30 seconds long, it'll air on the daily source

218
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:48,480
code feed as well as on serious, serious stars 102. So you can put your own plugs and shit in there.

219
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,320
And I just go crazy. Do whatever you want. Email me first if you're going to do it though. Okay. So

220
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,960
I so I don't have more than the 10 slots that are available. And so no one gets really disappointed.

221
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,080
And again, if you if you just call into the phone line, I'm sure I'll be able to slip something

222
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
in myself in the next two.

226
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,480
I don't really have any new years resolutions to speak of other than to keep on riding the wheels

227
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,960
off this motherfucker called life. But I do promise myself that I'm going to do a lot more

228
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,920
blogging. I tried this past year really to do everything in audio and what I've noticed is that a lot

229
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,320
of the facts get turned around. Things I say people hear things the way they want to hear them.

230
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,640
Sometimes I miscommunicate things as well. And things come across incorrectly. Or when I hear people

231
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,120
spit it back, I'm like, oh, that's not exactly what I meant. So I'm going to do more blogging.

232
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,600
And I don't know if you looked at Podshow Plus recently, but the blogging tools have gotten a

233
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,120
shitload better. We have a fantastic fucking editor now that's built right in. You can do all kinds of

234
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,240
cool shit. You can embed stuff from your gallery directly into your blog post. So if you have

235
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,760
a picture's uploaded, then you can select one and it'll just insert it automatically.

236
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,360
We're going to do the same for video. The same for show episodes, the same for tracks. And it's

237
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,000
going to be all kinds of cool shit that you can do. Really, it will become a true social media network.

238
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
We're well on our way, I think, but it's going to get even better. And there's some other

239
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,640
things I got to fix as well. Adam is party and quick one mate. The levels your podcast is

240
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,760
DSE520 was coming through loud and clear in my ear buds. I had them jammed in deep as you do.

241
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,920
And then I made the mistake of letting it play out. So the advert for the end,

242
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,440
little blue nerd rums out. And that's really not very good is it. So could you have a look at that

243
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,960
for us? It really does suck ass as you chaps with today. Thank you. Bye bye.

244
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,760
Well, what would you chaps say then? It's so funny. Parkie cracked me up, dude. He goes on the

245
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:50,480
forms and yells about me and yells about me. But he'll still listen and call in and help me out.

246
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,720
And that is much appreciated. Yeah, the problem is all mine, actually. It's not it's not pod show.

247
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,480
Here's what happened when I reconfigured the studio. For some reason, I've set up, well, I thought

248
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,760
I set up the proper routing, but I just can't get enough signal into cast blaster. So I'm running

249
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,440
consistently at about minus 10 dB, which is definitely soft. And it's, uh, you're right. What's happening

250
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,400
is you're turning up the sound to be able to, it's all digital. So it's not like you get anything extra.

251
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,040
You just want to be able to listen to the show. And then when the show is over, you know,

252
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,640
incomes 0 dB and it blows out your ear drums. So what I'll do is I will remind you with the

253
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,880
end of the show to turn down the volume. And then by the time I get the studio, rejiggered and

254
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,760
re-fixed, I'll have that fix as well. So it's, uh, it's not happening. It's impossible that it's

255
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,440
happening with every single podcast that I'm sure it's only happening with the daily source code.

256
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,080
Just because, uh, what's coming out is, uh, it's just the levels are just way off.

257
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,280
Although they are p-dub approved. I'll have you know. Let's do it today. It's Friday.

258
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,520
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Food about Friday. I am spinal fund for the week.

259
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,560
Well, I tell everybody, well, I promised you. Well, yeah.

260
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,000
Gotta be sufficiently prepared for, uh, for predictions for the new year. That's what we're

261
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,840
going to do in today's final thought of the week. Here are my 2007 media entertainment predictions.

262
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,640
The music sales industry is going to suffer a total meltdown in 2007 as several established

263
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,960
artists without a current record deal will crack the online social media networks.

264
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,240
Now, all those sales will not be significant. Mainstream media will build a case against the big

265
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,800
three labels, touting their demise. And that's going to make shareholders nervous, which will

266
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,400
result in a stock tail spin and an exodus of management. Now, the only people left to run the

267
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,120
joints will be lawyers and they won't be able to maintain sufficient levels of creativity to keep

268
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,560
the business viable. Now, the artist responsible for the upheaval will manage their

269
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,120
online customer base through their own online presence, utilizing, you know, the myriad of

270
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,800
APIs available to them for sales, for messaging and media distribution through all kinds of channels,

271
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:07,360
like PMN and LCD baby. Independent record labels will become management facilities for artists

272
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,440
and mark my words, they will start to invest in talent. The music publishing business is going to

273
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,080
flourish in 2007 as new players innovate on licensing terms and become talent development agencies

274
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,440
in some cases this will, in fact, be the current independent record labels. You're liking it so

275
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,280
far. A small group of software engineers will become rich and famous after they realize the

276
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,480
weak link in the iPod chain is iTunes and they're going to build an open source cross-platform

277
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,320
iTunes replacement that will open the floodgates to new content. Whatever you do, please don't

278
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,000
send me email and tell me that's already happened because it hasn't. It'll catch on when

279
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,680
it's the right application. Now, because of this and other mobile-playing options, drive-time audiences

280
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:58,000
will surge for audio podcasts. With this surge, though, public radio programming will also

281
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,280
surpass the audience of commercial radio. Because let's face it, public radio ain't bad, folks,

282
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,000
as we could shit there. Furthermore, in 2007, Jiselle will start a celebrity call-in show titled,

283
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,320
I don't know who this is, but stop fucking calling Jiselle asshole, where host Jiselle tries

284
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,840
to guess the identity of celebrity phone callers based on sexual clues. Okay, made that one up.

285
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,120
In 2007, at least one video blogger will grow a huge audience that will grow very quickly through

286
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,600
viral and social media networks. In other words, you're going to peer about it through IM or

287
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,720
read an email, maybe stumble upon it otherwise, but you will be hearing about it. The socially

288
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,440
disconnected will become aware when the local weatherman quips about it during his evening report.

289
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,960
That's how it works. It's what viral is all about, or let's just call it social.

290
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,320
The serialized programming of these, this video blogger, or maybe even more, will strike

291
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,720
a chord with the audience because of the words, the writing, the timing, delivery.

292
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,400
It'll be highly consumable and accessible. So-called production value will be of no importance.

293
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,440
Now, on the other side of this spectrum, for 2007, I predict opinion based in dramatic video

294
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,360
programming will attract audiences that demand innovative production values as different from expensive.

295
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,480
It's innovative. Both types of programming will be able to build their brand into valuable media

296
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,880
properties, advertisers, check this out in 2007, and we'll have to audition to sponsor these programs.

297
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,120
By the way, I'm going to post all of these in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com,

298
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,240
not today because I don't want people just reading it. I want them to actually listen to the

299
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,320
fucking show, but I will post them after the new year, so we'll have an online record of it.

300
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,320
In 2007, members of online podcasting communities will come to realize that a community of

301
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,520
podcasters is about as silly as a community of broadcasters, and they will split into three

302
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,240
main factions, broadcasting for part for profit, podcasting for dummies, and podcasting to save

303
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,160
the world and win valuable cash prizes. By the way, podcasting for dummies is a metaphor,

304
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,560
it doesn't mean you're dumb if you don't want to make money. Okay?

305
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,440
In 2007, reality-based talent shows will become the new mainstream record companies,

306
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,000
making hundreds of millions and revenues from syndication, SMS voting, and licensing.

307
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Every record they will release will be a huge success. Unfortunately,

308
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
they're only going to release one record for 13 weeks to stay in sync with their video programming,

309
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,720
so we'll see hundreds of similar talent-based reality programming on television, on cable, online,

310
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,600
all across the internet, all with their own distribution networks and targeted audiences.

311
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,280
Potential contestants will soon be scouted just like record companies used to do

312
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,280
in the darkest corners of the crappiest hell holes on earth.

313
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,800
And Simon Call will suffer physical injury after sore loser or cost him at a public appearance.

314
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,920
But that's not really that hard to predict that now is it?

315
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,840
Search-based advertising will level out mid-here as advertisers increase budgets for sponsorships

316
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,600
of media brands that they want to identify their own brand with. Brand advertising pricing in 2007

317
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,240
will ship from cost per thousand to an audience engagement metric.

318
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,280
Furthermore, let me just give myself a little more time there. The creative artist agency in

319
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,640
Hollywood will begin packaging programming amongst multiple brands that will include media properties

320
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:36,320
outside of the traditional mainstream media domain. In 2007, an advertising form known as the

321
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,120
infomercial will gain critical acclaim as spot advertising shifts from 30 seconds to long-form

322
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:51,440
programming concepts. Will it blend anybody? And finally, prediction for 2007, the tech world will

323
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,400
hardly take notice or complain about the demise of the Gilmore gang after Steve Gilmore

324
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,720
tries to gain attention by quitting the show and his job at Potcho.

325
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,720
Shortly thereafter, former Zif Davis and tech crunch technology reporter Natalie Delcante will break

326
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,600
through the Wall Street Journal's web 2.0 smoke screen reporting with a series of audio and video

327
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,800
programs produced exclusively for the Potcho network. Wait a minute, that's not a prediction.

328
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
That's already true.

329
00:28:48,800 --> 00:29:00,640
Yo, what's up, AC? This is Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the Chacha.

330
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,840
Hey, you know, this week had me thinking about the life of the potsafe Godfather, Mr. James Brown,

331
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,800
and while I'm incredibly sad about his passing, I have to think about his life as a celebration.

332
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:16,320
I also have to thank him for the many, many good times that he caused in my life. I also have to

333
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,400
think about the thousands and thousands of artists that he influenced. His sound is all over the

334
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,360
Potsafe music network in one way or another. One of the bands that you can really hear JB sound is the

335
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,760
band's Shag out of New York. This is something a little different than how the Godfather would have

336
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,680
done it, but I think he would have approved. This is the band's Shag with the song,

337
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:47,520
Boba, Boba, on the Daily Source Code. Hey, have a great week everyone. I'll talk to you soon.

338
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Boba, Boba, I stand on top of the world. Look around and you've been all the

339
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Potsafe, I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

340
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:55,680
I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

341
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:05,680
I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

342
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:21,680
I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

344

I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

345
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:27,680
I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

346
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:53,680
I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

I stand on top of the world.

I stand on top of the world. I stand on top of the world.

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:31,680
I stand on top of the world.

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:51,680
I stand on top of the world.

I stand on top of the world.

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:49,680
I stand on top of the world.

I stand on top of the world.

I stand on top of the world.

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:37,680
I stand on top of the world.

I stand on top of the world.

372
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:15,680
I stand on top of the world.
