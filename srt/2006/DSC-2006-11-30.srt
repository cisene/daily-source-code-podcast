16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass then the next generation

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,800
radio content in my ears I like to think I'm flying into the future

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not going to get it my way

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to get it my way

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to get it my way

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not hiding my way

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going to get it my way

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to get it my way

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm going to get it my way

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to get it my way

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to get it my way

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
oh yeah, that's why I'm talking about

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
around

18
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
the

19
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,000
balance

20
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,040
The show notes at daily source

21
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,040
So number five, zero six of the daily source code coming to you from the affluent suburb of

22
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Surrey and Gilford in the United Kingdom, still playing Mr. Mom Patricia still in Rotterdam.

23
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,040
I gotta tell you, man. Why I'm told you this before? Ah, so much respect for,

24
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,040
for basically any parent who stays at home and makes the house run.

25
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Particularly if you got kids and animals and crap like that.

26
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Oh boy, there's so much to do. And you know what?

27
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,040
I've got to do everything just right because you know this right whenever she comes back,

28
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,040
the first thing she does is investigates everything.

29
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
To see if everything has been done properly and if everything was done on time.

30
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,040
And of course there's the the obvious stuff, feed the kid, feed the animals.

31
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Ah, but if you don't open the curtains in the morning, well, then the Mary and the neighbor on the other side of the street,

32
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,040
you know, she'll see that and then she'll wonder if something's wrong and she'll report that.

33
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,040
And then of course, I'm in trouble because I didn't do exactly as I'm supposed to do.

34
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
So I'm creating a checklist.

35
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,040
As a as an aviator, I believe strongly in checklist because they will basically keep you alive.

36
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
You can't think you know the checklist. You can't think I, you know,

37
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,040
I'll remember and I won't forget any of the items because of course,

38
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,040
there will be a day when you do forget an item and that could of course be what we call a day record.

39
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,040
So I have this checklist man. It's like first, you know, the first part of the checklist isn't even really my checklist.

40
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,040
It's the dog. Now, now I sleep through this, but every single morning, the dog comes up to Patricia.

41
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,040
This little Yorkshire Terrier. He's very sweet and we love him dearly.

42
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,040
But you know, he comes up and he'll make these noise.

43
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,040
It's like it's not really a bark, but it's kind of like a half bark going.

44
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Well, you know, and this little dog, right? And he makes this really, this, this really big sound.

45
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:22,040
So I've learned to sleep through that, but that of course is the signal and that comes around 630 a.m.

46
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,040
That the dog wants to be put up on the bed.

47
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,040
So now, of course, that's part, that's the first item when I checklist in the morning.

48
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,040
And then, you know, it's seven when I actually, when the alarm goes off, because we've got to get Christine off to school.

49
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,040
The other check start and that includes folding the covers back on the bed.

50
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,040
It includes opening up the curtains and the blinds.

51
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Then, of course, I have to carry the dog downstairs.

52
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Make sure that he goes out into the backyard to do his stuff.

53
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Then, I have to pour a little special glass of cat milk for the, for ginger for our, our tabby.

54
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,040
I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on.

55
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,040
But let me tell you, guys, if you, if you're serious about not getting shit,

56
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
you got to make a checklist.

57
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,040
And my checklist is longer than that of a fucking 747 unfortunately.

58
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,040
What are you going to do?

59
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Ah, she's back.

60
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Amy Mac.

61
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Here to get my ass in shape with some real work.

62
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,040
It's week 17 of our quest to save Adam's ass.

63
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
What are we doing?

64
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Adam, how are you?

65
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm good, Amy, how are you?

66
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
What's wrong?

67
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
We're getting fancy.

68
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,040
We're going to need a chair and your wireless because we're on the floor.

69
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Oh, shit.

70
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Okay, let me turn on the other one.

71
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
You're a folding chair would be great.

72
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
I wouldn't really recommend a chair on wheels.

73
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Okay, I got it.

74
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
I go collect your goods.

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Wait a minute.

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Hold on.

77
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I got it.

78
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Okay, I'm on the other mic now.

79
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Okay, I'll face the chair seat toward you.

80
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
The chair.

81
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Oh, face it towards me.

82
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Now, play on the ground and pop your feet up onto the chair.

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Oh, hold on.

84
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
You want your feet as flat as possible on the chair seat.

85
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
All right.

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Okay.

87
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Now lift your butt and make a bridge.

88
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Lift it on the floor.

89
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
We're back in the day.

90
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Take it to the bridge.

91
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Okay.

92
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Now you're going to go up and down 10 times.

93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Ready, go.

94
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Up and down.

95
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
When you come down, you want to come close but not all the way to the floor.

96
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Oh, okay.

97
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, my God.

98
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Keep it slow and control.

99
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
All right.

100
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Your hands are going to lay on the floor next to you.

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Two.

102
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
The button free.

103
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Now on 10th one, hold it up there.

105
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Four.

106
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Squeeze your butt as high as possible.

107
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,040
I make my clients use this ability, but for their feet to create an unstable surface.

108
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
So you lucked out with the chair.

109
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Oh, thanks.

110
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
All right.

111
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
You can come down.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
This works.

113
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Your butt, legs, stomach, and even your calves and back.

114
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm sure you felt every single one of us.

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Oh, yes, I did.

116
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Every single one.

117
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
I'm out of touch.

118
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Say nice things about me.

119
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Until next time.

120
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Thank you so much.

121
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Amy, how could I not say nice things about you?

122
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Get rid of the other mic there.

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Wow.

124
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Yeah, I did feel that one.

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Well, that one in my ass.

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,040
You know, you could actually do that with two people that exercise.

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Just to make it a little bit more challenging.

128
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Go ahead and visualize what I look like doing that.

129
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,040
And you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

130
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Let's see.

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
What am I hearing now?

132
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
How was that?

133
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Something's, oh, I see.

134
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Okay, there we go.

135
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
The other mic was still on.

136
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Let me see.

137
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
I have a whole list of things to talk about here.

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
First of all.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,040
On pod show plus if you go into your collection and you add a show.

140
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,040
The RSS and OPML importers are live and they're back and they're working.

141
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,040
So you can literally take an OPML file of subscriptions.

142
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,040
You can upload that into your pod show plus account into the collections.

143
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
And it will load all of your shows in.

144
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,040
You can actually create it into a single channel if you want to.

145
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,040
You can add an external RSS feed to get to put a show into your collection,

146
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
which is not currently in the database.

147
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
And of course it's automatically then added to the database,

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,040
so to show up and search.

149
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
And I'm quite, quite chaffed with that actually.

150
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Yeah.

151
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
It's working.

152
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Big story here in the UK.

153
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
This is unbelievable.

154
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,040
You heard about this Russian spy who was poisoned to death.

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Now, of course, you know, that's the story.

156
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
And it sounds very plausible.

157
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,040
It's one of the definitely sounds like one of those kind of cold war era.

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,040
James Bond asked type scenarios where Russian spy is poisoned by.

159
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
What is the.

160
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Let me find out.

161
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,040
I'll put a link in the show notes to the CNN story.

162
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,040
The actual poison is.

163
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Polonium to one zero.

164
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,040
A rare radioactive element usually made in specialized nuclear facilities.

165
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
So this guy was riddled with it.

166
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
And he died.

167
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,040
And he looked really shitty at the end there because they have all kinds of footage that they run of him.

168
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
I presume that's the end of his life that they're showing in the hospital bed.

169
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,040
So they they checked out hotel rooms where this guy was restaurants,

170
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,040
office buildings, and they're finding traces of this polonium to one zero everywhere.

171
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,040
And and someone thought, you know, maybe we should check out the airplane that he flew on.

172
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,040
So now two seven sixty sevens at Heathrow British airway seven six sevens have been tested positive.

173
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:34,040
And a third was grounded in Moscow awaiting examination for contamination of polonium two one zero.

174
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:41,040
British airways now trying to contact 33,000 passengers who have flown on these jets since October 25.

175
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,040
That's an interesting statistic right there.

176
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Two hundred and twenty one flights in two months, I guess, or less than two months.

177
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Three thousand crew and airport personnel had contact with the planes.

178
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,040
And let me see apparently.

179
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Sixty eight have been referred to specialists health authorities.

180
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Test take about one week.

181
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I mean, you know, we were all freaked out and we shut basically shut down the air, you know, the air or the aviation industry.

182
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:22,040
For for this explosive so called explosive liquids that terrorists were planning on taking on board.

183
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
And when he's that shit.

184
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Yeah, we got to have it, you know, got to have another scan now.

185
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,040
We've got to have radiation scans while we go through to make sure that you're not trying to kill you to fill up passengers.

186
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,040
And it is quite serious, though, and I'll bet you that a lot of people are going to get quite sick from this, even if they.

187
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Yeah, this is basically if you ingest it or inhale it, you're fucked.

188
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Lots of feedback about yesterday's story about Cliff Richard, sir Cliff Richard.

189
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Who's some of his songs that he wrote and and of course also they were hit songs that he has copyright on.

190
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:12,040
About to expire in 2008, actually, and Sir Cliff is making a big issue of it and saying he's one of the instigators of trying to extend the copyright.

191
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Lifetime from 50 years to 95 years because essentially in 2008 hits when his songs start to become public domain, which means anyone can use them for anything without paying a license to Sir Cliff.

192
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,040
And understandably, yeah, he's upset.

193
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
There are some opposing views.

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Don't work in Ask Up. I just thought I'd like to weigh in on the 50 year copyright and plans for extension or please for extension right Cliff Richard with a couple of thoughts.

195
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:51,040
The first one is that in this country, UK, can reach school at 16 and get a job and make you weigh in the world and work at 165.

196
00:12:52,040 --> 00:13:00,040
That's 49 years in which you have to provide for yourself and put enough money away to provide a pension for when you retire.

197
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,040
So I don't know why Cliff Richard didn't get any difference.

198
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,040
He's got 50 years living off the year, the world sees some of his songs.

199
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:16,040
And now he should have put enough away to keep him for the rest of his days, he doesn't need a copyright extension.

200
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:23,040
And it's a copyright extension to a longer term with right is right.

201
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,040
And how come he's got any staff to decide it's important at the 50 year barrier starts to arrive?

202
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,040
There is really that important. This should have been agitated for this 20, 30, 40, 45 years ago, maybe even 40, 90 years ago.

203
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Say that the 50 year copyright was wrong.

204
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,040
And now it doesn't come to the attention now, it's about now the gravy change about the cost of the rails.

205
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Well, good luck to him. I don't think he deserves it.

206
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
I don't think many other people will either, but for now.

207
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Well, some interesting things there.

208
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,040
It sounds a little bit like you're throwing some of your own unhappy dark baggage onto Sir Cliff.

209
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,040
And I had a good think about this.

210
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I'm a copyright holder myself. I do lots of stuff that has that I own that has copyright over it.

211
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:19,040
I think the first thing is you should not presume just because Cliff Richard, Sir Cliff Richard, I really should say that all the time because it's proper Sir Cliff.

212
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Just because Sir Cliff has made millions over a 50 year time span.

213
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Don't think for a second that he's still gotten money.

214
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:39,040
I think this is one of the biggest misconceptions of people who are famous is that they actually famous and rich at the same time.

215
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Those two increasingly do not go hand in hand really they don't.

216
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,040
And it's very difficult to sustain a lifestyle once you hit it big.

217
00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:00,040
You know, you got to kind of keep hitting big records hit records and over time, you know, royalties on some of his songs, you know, they definitely dwindle licensing.

218
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,040
I'm sure if someone wants to do a commercial and license his music, you know, those are nice little hits interim hits.

219
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,040
But but don't for a second think that he's made or that he still has a shitload of money.

220
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:16,040
So I think that he, he may just, you know, he very well may want to keep that income.

221
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:32,040
You know, it could easily be, you know, what about, you know, so think about it. He's got to living dull, which is, you know, worldwide very famous hit, you know, got myself a cry and walk and talk and, you know, whatever live in dull.

222
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:41,040
So, Mattel will be able to use that for their Barbie commercial and Sir Cliff left the sit at home agitated watching that song.

223
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:49,040
The creation, his art, his work sell plastic dolls with no genitalia.

224
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,040
And that could be very frustrating. So I do see the other side of the coin on the other hand. I think it's wonderful.

225
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,040
That creative works coming to the public domain and can be used by others.

226
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:09,040
But you know that really what's going to happen is going to be used commercially. So I don't know. I'm kind of on both sides of the fence.

227
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:27,040
I feel, I feel his pain in a way. Now there's lots of shit that I've done that people re broadcast on mainstream radio and television stuff that they would all definitely have to ask my permission for and they never do.

228
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,040
You know, you can spend all your lifetime, you know, running around trying to track down money for that.

229
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:40,040
But as an example, my official biographer, the official biographer of curry of my broadcast career, Tom Scooting.

230
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:51,040
You can find him at clockwalk.net. He lives down under. He's been collecting a lot of my radio shows from the past and he put up three clips through YouTube clips.

231
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,040
I got to tell him that he's got to put the shit up. He's got to use the the new Potio video uploader.

232
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,040
You know, we also do the flash video thing now and you can put it in your collection. You can share it and do all kinds of cool shit with it.

233
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Potio plus.

234
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,040
So he found three clips, which I've put on curry.com. You've got to see these.

235
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,040
One is well, two of them are me on stage with famous people performing with them. Well, famous.

236
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Let's just say meet loophus famous and there's some other guys.

237
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,040
And another one where I pretty funny interview I did with Grace Jones in the very early 80s.

238
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:35,040
And, you know, that's all stuff that, you know, obviously I have certain rights over that material.

239
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,040
You know, now it's on YouTube, you know, what are you going to do?

240
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,040
That's just kind of a fact of life and I'm actually I'm quite happy that it can be shared and people can enjoy this crap from 25 years ago.

241
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:51,040
And maybe get a good laugh out of it or just the laugh out of my, my hair, you know, either way it's okay.

242
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Hi Adam, it's Mark. I'm talking to you.

243
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,040
It turns out the BBC held and you suggested that Potio squaps cast my ears for me.

244
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
So guess for her.

245
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Yeah, I know worked for a radio one.

246
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,040
And I'll be doing the back for sure as of next Monday.

247
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
I don't know if that is all we've said about it.

248
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,040
But, you know, you'll be taking over at TomPotcast.com.

249
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,040
And we're not going to say in Oxford Beauty, Potio, he wants to remain independent.

250
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
He told me as he was clearly noticed.

251
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
But, good news all around.

252
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,040
So thanks for suggesting that to the BBC.

253
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Hey, I don't know who this is.

254
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,040
But stop fucking calling the Daily Source Code asshole.

255
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Mark, on Jerry Buckley.

256
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3, plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

257
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,040
And this Jousel thing has really gotten out of control.

258
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,040
People sending in all kinds of, all kinds of fun audio.

259
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
You heard that one just came in.

260
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Not particularly aimed at you, tartan man.

261
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Thanks for calling it.

262
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
I was kind of funny actually.

263
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Check this out.

264
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I think you're like it.

265
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
So, you know, what's kind of like it?

266
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
And I just, she's so cute.

267
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
I thought it was a joke.

268
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
She sent me a picture by the way.

269
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Okay.

270
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
I don't know who this is.

271
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
But stop fucking calling.

272
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Is Alan Paul.

273
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
She's Alan.

274
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Getting so much trouble.

275
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
And he's sound like 7 feet tall.

276
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Like he'll beat me so well.

277
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
I think I'm going to hang back on this one.

278
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Oh, oh, man.

279
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
He's such real stuff.

280
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I will give you a little advice.

281
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Oh, wow.

282
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Thank you.

283
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Oh, man.

284
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Hey, Adam.

285
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
It's Jousel.

286
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
I've been thinking about it.

287
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,040
And I realized that you had to see those things because of your wife.

288
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
So, I forgive you.

289
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,040
And I was also thinking that since you're going to be back in San Francisco next week,

290
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I'm going to try to put some money together and come up and see you again.

291
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Or you know it'll be really cool.

292
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Is this you could hop in your plane and come down to San Diego and pick me up.

293
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
That would be very, very cool.

294
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
So let me know what you want to do it.

295
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Talk to you later.

296
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Fight.

297
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Okay.

298
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,040
I guess everything's still up up in the air with Jousel.

299
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,040
This is the weirdest thing I've ever witnessed.

300
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Is this girl from San Diego?

301
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I don't know, Jousel.

302
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,040
I think we should just stop because this can only end in tears or something really, really bad.

303
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,040
And hanging out with you in San Francisco.

304
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Let me just check here.

305
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Hold on a second.

306
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
It's.

307
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Nope.

308
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
It's not on the checklist.

309
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Yeah, I don't encourage such it.

310
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,040
This is James from the UK.

311
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
I am.

312
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
It's.

313
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
It's.

314
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Let's all listen as enjoy this lovely voice mayor.

315
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:06,040
The one who listens to his podcasts at one third in the morning while walking his dogs.

316
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Yes.

317
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
I do.

318
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Thank you.

319
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
I am drunk.

320
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Then it's Christmas.

321
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Is a one cat.

322
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
It's too good by it.

323
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:28,040
I have to say there's a very high proportion of drunk calls coming from the UK versus the US.

324
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Yanks are really, really lagging behind.

325
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,040
No one calls when they're when they're stoned though.

326
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I always look forward to those calls and I get the drunk calls.

327
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Yeah, you should call Chris Moiles man.

328
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Get on the air.

329
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Get on the, get on the Chris Moiles show and.

330
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
And then and then plug the daily source code.

331
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Do something like that when you're drunk.

332
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
I'll be very cool.

333
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Hey, Adam, it's Sam here in the UK.

334
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
I just got our drink and.

335
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Tell me about this crazy thing.

336
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
It's just been going on in the UK just recently in London.

337
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,040
And on the 28th of November, Liverpool Street Station in London.

338
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,040
It was the last mobile clubbing event.

339
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
And just the later people turned up on the train station.

340
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
It started dancing a specific time.

341
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:18,040
And it's happening again tomorrow on the on the 30th of November.

342
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,040
And the instructions are as arrive at panning station.

343
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Good time.

344
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Walk around and get into your groove.

345
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Spread out throughout the whole station.

346
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,040
No dancing before night or seven 18.

347
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
At the instant the clock strikes seven 18.

348
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Dance like you've never danced before.

349
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Try not to dance in one place and always leave without a trace.

350
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
No letter please.

351
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
If you don't dance as long as the need takes you.

352
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
And I thought that was actually fantastic.

353
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,040
So I'm going to be turning out for panning station and seeing what the hell guys on.

354
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
And I suggest you do it too.

355
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Oh, that's it.

356
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
All right, dude.

357
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Folders.

358
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Of course.

359
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
All the folders doing all the wacky things.

360
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
Make sure you shoot some video.

361
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,040
A bomb man because that would have been perfect.

362
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Because at Liverpool Street Station is the station.

363
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
I get off.

364
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,040
I get out of the tube to go to our shortage office.

365
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,040
It's about a seven minute walk from there.

366
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
I could have witnessed that.

367
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Of course, I didn't go into the city yesterday.

368
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,040
I was supposed to be on a panel of digital Hollywood London.

369
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
And obviously more.

370
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
And I've ever heard one.

371
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
But I was still running today.

372
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
It's okay.

373
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
I was still running that fever three days in a row.

374
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,040
I'm pretty convinced that it's it's related to jet lag and and the checklist.

375
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,040
But I just felt like such shit.

376
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
So I apologize.

377
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Adam.

378
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
First to do it to Jezelle.

379
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Stand her up.

380
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Stand from Cisco.

381
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Stay to it to me.

382
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Put me up here in London.

383
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Digital Hollywood.

384
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
It's looking forward to seeing you.

385
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
You were wrong.

386
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Because it helped a rather bland presentation.

387
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,040
I need to have to shake it up here.

388
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Take it easy.

389
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
There you have it.

390
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Report from London.

391
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
A rather bland presentation.

392
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I'm sorry, man.

393
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Chris Jacob our head sales.

394
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
We'll be appearing on a panel on Friday.

395
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
I believe he's in town for just one day.

396
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Guys, if I can animal.

397
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Is it going all over the world?

398
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Make it podcast or money.

399
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Congratulations to Kelly Lewis.

400
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Episode number 100 of geek brief TV is up.

401
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Nice little compilation of.

402
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
It's it's really amazing.

403
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,040
The she opens up the show with a compilation of a whole bunch of different openers.

404
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Basically geek brief one geek brief two geek brief number nine number nine number nine.

405
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,040
And it's like one of those.

406
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
You've probably seen these these videos.

407
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
A picture a day for a year.

408
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
It's like that.

409
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,040
And it's fascinating to watch how Kelly has.

410
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
In some ways matured.

411
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
In some ways gotten.

412
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Really really sexy.

413
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,040
I think she lost a little bit of weight over the over the years as well.

414
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
I can't quite tell.

415
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Anyway, she has a.

416
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
She's a t-shirt on today that.

417
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,040
It looks very good.

418
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Or Kathy looking good everybody.

419
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Those of you who follow the entire apple trademarking the word podcast.

420
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Big blogger's for your vibe.

421
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Yesterday.

422
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Let me open up the email.

423
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Okay.

424
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
This happened to.

425
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
What is this global geek the podcast network?

426
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
What's his name?

427
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Hold on a second.

428
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
It's just loading.

429
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Takes for a second here.

430
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Great.

431
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Yeah.

432
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Great.

433
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Is it great Davis?

434
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Is that what I'm thinking?

435
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Let me just see.

436
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
No.

437
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Dave Gray?

438
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
No.

439
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
No.

440
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Yeah.

441
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Dave Gray.

442
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Yeah.

443
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
There you go.

444
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Dave Gray host of the global geek podcast.

445
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Okay.

446
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
So apparently.

447
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,040
He sent one Australian dollar.

448
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
To Apple.

449
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
To use the term podcast.

450
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Which I think is pretty funny.

451
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,040
And so he scanned in a reply that he got from the Apple trademark department.

452
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Dear Mr. Gray, apple is in receipt of your letter.

453
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Your date at October 3rd, 2006.

454
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
We are returning your check for one dollar.

455
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,840
Apple does not object to third party usage of the generic term podcast to accurately refer

456
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,040
to podcasting services.

457
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Apple does not license the term podcast or in regards the Apple trademark department.

458
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,040
So everyone's like jumping up and down and saying, oh, this is great.

459
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
You know, it's confirmed.

460
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,040
You know, Apple is leaving the trademark alone.

461
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
I see exactly the opposite.

462
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,040
And in fact, I think we should shut up and not be so euphoric because what you.

463
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
This is setting a precedent right here.

464
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Apple is setting a precedent by saying, we do not object to third party usage.

465
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,040
In other words, they're saying that they own the word podcast.

466
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,040
And because they said Apple does not license the term podcast in no way.

467
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Does that mean that they don't claim to own a trademark or some.

468
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Type of, you know, service mark or whatever on on the name podcast.

469
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,040
So basically, you know, we just became Apple's bitch.

470
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm not happy about that.

471
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
I would reject it.

472
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,040
I would say you have no right to object or not to object.

473
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,040
What's that Steve Jobs pulling the tank up front?

474
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
I don't know, man.

475
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
I find that highly suspicious.

476
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Presidents is very, very important in law.

477
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,040
So I'm not too happy about about what I saw there.

478
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
And I finally figured out what I want for Christmas.

479
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,040
The other day, I was saying that I really had no idea.

480
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
I have everything.

481
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
All I want is health and happiness.

482
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Well, there is one other thing I have to say.

483
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,040
It is a flight simulator.

484
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Actually, I thought, and I was looking at Google for flight simulators and you get all kinds of stuff.

485
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
And I downloaded a couple of the free ones.

486
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,040
And actually, when I bought a little joystick to see, you know, to test some of the demo versions of flight simulator 2004.

487
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
But I'm looking for something.

488
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:31,040
You know, and I love the open source ones, by the way, because a lot of cool shit does creep in because anyone could contribute to the source files and the data files.

489
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,040
When I'm talking about, you know, I want the hardware, man.

490
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
I want the real panel.

491
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I want the enclosure.

492
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
I want the 3D view.

493
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
And I found out that these are not called flight simulators.

494
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
I know they're called FTDs.

495
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:52,040
That is Fox Trot Tango Delta flight training devices, which is a stupid name because it so easily can be confused with an STD.

496
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
And I found this company elite.

497
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Oh, man, they make some fucking amazing, amazing flight simulators.

498
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Complete enclosures, 3D views, real panels.

499
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
I can't wait.

500
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
I can't wait to install one of these.

501
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:12,040
After we move, after we're in the new cottage, and I have a third floor all to myself, let me tell you.

502
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
I'm going for it.

503
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
And these are like certified.

504
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,040
You know, you fly for five hours in these things.

505
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,040
And you can actually count it towards your, your instrument rate license.

506
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I mean, it's like apparently the experience is so real that they are counted as real even on the,

507
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:36,040
on on the application and what they're, they're counting.

508
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
I'm losing it.

509
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
I'm totally fucking losing it.

510
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
We've got about it.

511
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Humans in the parking lot, arteries covered blood clots.

512
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Push you through the arms of the apartment stores.

513
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Me on crosses in Christmas lights, credit card debts and brand new bikes.

514
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:06,040
The holidays are here in this year and more.

515
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,040
The rabbi reads from the test to me in the bank accounts.

516
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Is it the easement, salvation, Santa, solicit for the poor?

517
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Disception of democracy, the planaries of folk foreign policy.

518
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:31,040
The holidays aren't here in which they're at war.

519
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Smoky skies and fixed elections.

520
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,040
And just distracts from all directions.

521
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,040
People with their backs against the floor.

522
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,040
Looking for someone to set us free.

523
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,040
A king with fists like Muhammad Ali.

524
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
The holidays aren't here.

525
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,040
And we're still at war.

526
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:03,040

Let's go, they gotta imagine too.

532
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:32,040
The profits of oppression grow like never before.

533
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,040
I'll hail to the capitalist thief.

534
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,040
The moon get lost once and cover it off.

535
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:45,040

Religious wars and domination were all trading globalization the prices of patrol beyond control.
