Let's go, we value who we are, we won't

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're any of the soil, your young mechanic can be a panic

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We just could look you down

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And if army, it can be a stormy

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If she dances with all, we stop it then

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're at the heart, we won't

We're at the heart, we won't

Hello, let's do it, yeah.

Hello, let's do it, yeah

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You shoot Petra is your way

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
O'er that we can pursue, yeah

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She threw, all the pieces thin

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Say it the light away

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The blue righteous is always crazy

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Shut her a loop you hear

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hey, we don't know how to do it

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and now, it's to shoot them

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:12,000

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,200
opened up the show by telling you that it is indeed the mystic 512. I've been trying to

39
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,280
play that song for you for two days in a row. How is it possible that I went to California?

40
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,760
I went to Los Angeles, that is, and that I stayed at the same hotel I stayed last time,

41
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,520
but I swore I wouldn't stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel, which of course is the epitome of

42
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,560
old world old fashioned Hollywood. And it shows because they still haven't fixed their

43
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,720
goddamn internet connection. It was impossible for me to really tight schedule. You know,

44
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,760
when you're in LA, you got to do breakfast meetings. It's like 730, and of course you don't finish

45
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,600
up the day until 1030 at night after you're done with your dinner meeting. Everybody take in meetings

46
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
and there's just no time in the morning to dig around. You know, I would need to get my pod

47
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,440
safe music. I need to be able to upload stuff. And in the morning is when everyone else apparently

48
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,880
is on the network at the Beverly Hills hotel. So I'm sorry. I wasn't able to get a show out to you.

49
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,160
But it's good to be back in the condo. And let me tell you, man. I have been there. I've been,

50
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,840
I have been to the Death Star. There's a lot of confusion going on. Hollywood, my friends.

51
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,360
Everybody is running around trying to figure stuff out. And yeah, I know everyone's got to be in

52
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
the new media. We've got to be doing the new stuff. Even if we aren't making any money, we want

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,920
to do stuff with you. And let's take another meeting. And oh my god, it was, it's like the whole

54
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,600
town is just going nuts because they're not sure how to how to participate in the stuff we're

55
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,400
doing online. We met a lot of great people over the past two days, though. It was great to see

56
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,240
Tony Costas from Costas a World, Sharon Bam from Rock and Roll TV. Oh, man, we sell so many people.

57
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,520
Crank you. You met the guys from G-Living Live. Of course, we also met people at like

58
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:58,400
William Morris Agency. C-A-A. I see it. It was fun though. It really was. Yesterday, I just got

59
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,360
to tell you though. I was, I was so fed up with everything so fed up, just even having breakfast,

60
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,800
just listening to the conversations at tables. I should have recorded that. I would just too busy.

61
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,520
I wasn't thinking. Anyway, so I had this whole thing planned out. I was going to use the

62
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:23,920
the dial tone system, which apparently really works. You know, where I basically give you the touchton

63
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,840
dial tones and you hold your telephone up to your speaker and it actually will dial. I was going

64
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,080
to give you my room number to dial so that, you know, we could have some fun with it, but I didn't

65
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,080
have a line anyway. We'll be doing more with the dial tones later on, but perhaps we can still do

66
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,120
have a little bit of the fun that I'd planned for you while I was in the Beverly Hills hotel.

67
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,480
It's a real sing-along free hall. And, uh, no, I don't think it's pot safe.

68
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,080
I just found the head. And, one day, he was shooting ads and food up through the ground. Come

69
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,720
above the link through the hall and answer. Right, who? Texas T.

70
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:38,080
Just thinking, oh, gentlemen, can folks said, Jed move away from them, said California is the place

71
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,120
you're to be, so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly Hills that is some swimming

72
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,520
booths movie star, Josh. Granny and me always has to dance this little number. If you'll take my

73
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,720
part, I'll try to take Granny's part. What do you say?

74
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:19,840
Hey, it's all for all the fellow dude, try to keep out of the world, huh?

75
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:27,280
Now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all this kid. They would like to thank you, folks,

76
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,960
it's kind of a drop at the end. I won't invite you back again to this locality. I have a heap

77
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:41,360
in heaven of the hospitality Beverly Hills. That's what to call them now. Nice folks,

78
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:54,800
y'all, come back here. Much back. Yep. That's all. You know it. Earl Scruggs,

79
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,560
Ballad of Jed, Clampett. Yeah, that was good. Of course, there were some good parts of the trip,

80
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,760
you know, hooking up with Mark Yoshimura Namcoff, hadn't seen him in a while. And it's always good

81
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,480
for me to to see Mark in person because, you know, sometimes the thing he says, I'm

82
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,280
Pacific Coast, hell away. I just so brash and so mean and it's good to, you know, look at him.

83
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,720
So I can just go, oh yeah, that's right. I understand now. Hey Adam, it's Chris Conley from CC

84
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:30,560
radio. biz and I was listening to DSC 511 and you said this. The sky is completely red. The sun

85
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,120
is just coming up over the clouds and the distance over the day. And even though,

86
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,040
in fact, I'm going to actually put down the shade here so I can see what's on my screen.

87
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,440
You know, there's an old, uh, damn, that's loud. There's an old sailor's, uh,

88
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:55,200
rhyme that says, uh, uh, reds, uh, reds guys at night, sailors delight, reds guys at morning,

89
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,920
sailors take warning. I don't know though because I've had some really nice red mornings here in

90
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,000
in the Bay area and the days have been just fantastic. Oh, yeah. And I just wanted to mention

91
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,640
after spending two months on a lobster boat, what I realized is that sailors take warning in the

92
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,680
morning because of red skies, although it may seem like a nice day being sunny, the water is affected

93
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,000
by the wind and the wind will pick up. Now, living in the city, that affects the weather.

94
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,120
And frankly, your safety isn't determined by the wind. So that's why that's all Adam.

95
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,080
All right. Okay. Folder. Folder scruncher. No, no, no, giveers, no takers.

96
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,840
Okay, a couple more days left in San Francisco. It's going to be great because we have our, uh,

97
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,800
our second annual holiday party coming up on, um, what is it Friday?

98
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,320
Yeah, that should be cool. We've got a lot of, I think we're going to have about 125 people.

99
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,160
Now, of course, the spouses are allowed to come and and kids and bring in some people up from,

100
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:04,560
from Los Angeles, um, oh, by the way, as I came back to the condo yesterday, I took a look at the home page.

101
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,440
And there were two things that I thought were that pretty damn interesting. The first one,

102
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,760
Cali Lewis appeared on the MSNBC with former colleague of mine, Allison Stewart, to give you the, uh,

103
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,120
was that?

104
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,360
You hear that something's changed. You know, the gremlins have been in,

105
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,960
been into the, uh, into the condo while I was gone. I also had everything's feeding back and beeping

106
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,480
all over the place. Anyway, um, so that was pretty cool. There's a nice clip of that, uh,

107
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,200
that you can find in the home page of podshow.com. Um, and then, uh, the high fish show,

108
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,680
um, Lika and Kevin apps went to the premiere of the new Will Smith movie.

109
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,560
And they got, uh, they got a one on one with Will Smith and they got some of the excitement there,

110
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,640
the premiere, and they got the mayor of San Francisco. And, uh, I was really proud. Like, yeah, go.

111
00:12:52,640 --> 00:13:01,280
And very interesting to see, um, Jada Pink at Smith, who, um, you know, it's, it's funny. Once

112
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,360
you get a different type of crew once, you know, if it's not someone from entertainment tonight,

113
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:13,440
you know, or some real, you know, real mainstream, achy type entertainment show, and it seems to be a

114
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,160
little more, you know, in the groove in the vibe, which the high fish show is completely all about.

115
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
All of a sudden, people start talking very differently, and you should really take a look at this,

116
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,520
and tell me if you don't think, uh, Jada Smith, uh, Will Smith's wife is, is kind of throwing a

117
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,040
little different attitude into the mix, which I'd like, because it seems like it's much more her,

118
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:39,680
much more real, but it was just something that, uh, that I really noticed. Um, you know, uh, I really

119
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,600
wanted to hook up Barry Barry is the guy who does, uh, cure him radio, radio, cure him, and, uh,

120
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,520
Barry, um, maintains a lot of the forums at castblaster.com and helps, uh, castblaster Mike out.

121
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,240
As you know, we're working on, uh, castblaster video, which is, um, that's going to be so cool.

122
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,120
You should check out, check out testing one two three dot pod show dot com testing one two three,

123
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,960
uh, and that's new world's one two three dot pod show dot com. That's, uh, castblaster Mike,

124
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,400
and I, I really, I think that what the guy is doing is fantastic. Um, he's really using his,

125
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,200
he's eating his own dog food as he's testing along. So he's putting himself on camera, uh,

126
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,680
while he's testing the application. Anyway, long story short, uh, that, uh, I really want to

127
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,400
hook Barry up and play his winter promo, uh, but Barry, dude, two minutes long. Hi, this is Barry

128
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:34,000
J and Jess from Radio QRM. Hey there. Well, it's that time of year again. The towns and villages

129
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,840
up here in New Hampshire are decorated to the hill with all sorts of colorful lights and inflatable holiday

130
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:47,440
decorations. We'd like to call this the Christmas season. Josh 11 o'clock. The Grinch by the front

131
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,080
porch is small. Heart won't be growing three sizes a day this year. When we're not out hunting

132
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,240
inflatable holiday decorations, Jess and I do a weekly podcast from the Menanda region of New Hampshire.

133
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,600
Josh frosty at two o'clock. No more birthdays for him. The show is a little home spun humor

134
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:15,600
reindeer at five o'clock Josh. One down seven to go, a little news. Josh, over there,

135
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,920
Snoopy by the Christmas tree. No more dancing in the backyard for him and a little fun with

136
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,480
life in New Hampshire. Josh up on the rooftop. Santa!

137
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,520
sin is going to be running a little late this year. Oh yeah, and we also feature great music

138
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:43,120
from the pod safe music network. So check us out at radioqrm.com or visit our pod show site at

139
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:51,920
radioqrm.podshow.com. Oh no. Is that an inflatable snow globe with the entire cast of

140
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,360
root off the red nose reindeer inside? Barry J. Hand me my hell of sir.

141
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,880
Radioqrm does not condone the destruction puncture or dismemberment of any decoration for

142
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,080
the Christmas season. No actual inflatable holiday decorations were destroyed during the making of this

143
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,320
promo. Well, maybe just one. If the use of the word Christmas offend you, grow a thicker skin.

144
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,480
Yeah nice Christmas spirit there guys. All right Los Angeles was in the Christmas spirit.

145
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,800
You know, it's always so weird to be roaming around a relatively warm climate and seeing all these

146
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,800
unbelievable Christmas displays. As we were right in Beverly Hills with no fucking internet.

147
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:55,840
The houses were just extraordinary. I'm kidding around about about LA, but there is definitely

148
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,920
some, there's a lot of people who are in California who are really dissolutioned

149
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,960
with what's going on in Hollywood and they are showing up and that's what's really cool.

150
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,960
I really, I really like the talent that's that's walking around there that just no longer fits in.

151
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,120
And I'm not talking about just, you know, people who never got a break. I'm talking about people who

152
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,320
have had many breaks and are just sick and tired of the whole process.

153
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,680
And there's a lot of people out there with big fuck you money who also just want to do something cool. So

154
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,560
that's the good news. But it's exactly the way I remembered it really is. Let me see if something

155
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:40,000
else was going to say about, hmm, crap, I can't remember. I'll tell you what, I'll go look at my

156
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,600
notes and you think about the spirit of Christmas.

157
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,400
What do all of a sudden? Hi. Hello. I'm the spirit of Christmas and I can give you everything you want.

158
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,920
What do you want for Christmas? I want everything you have. And you computer and you house?

159
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,680
One woman, two woman, three woman, everything. Well, I'm okay with that. But money?

160
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,440
How much? As much as you can, pal. Oh, a million? A million is that okay?

161
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,720
Ah, that's that will get me started. Okay, I need you to do something.

162
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,720
What would you like? Yeah, I need you to close your eyes, look deep into your heart and send all

163
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,440
your love to Adam Curry. He is a very greedy man. Yeah. Can you say I love Adam Curry? He needs you.

164
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,800
Okay, I love you Adam Curry. Adam Curry. I love Adam Curry. Thank you, buddy. Merry Christmas.

165
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,800
All right, thank you. So, uh, getting back last night. Uh, and we had a little delay because the

166
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,840
day was all fog-bid, day area. So, uh, I think we left about probably about an hour later than scheduled.

167
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,400
So, I got in around 10, 10, 30. You know, like, it's been very short nights, no more than five

168
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,400
hours each night, really, not kidding. So, maybe I can get six, you know, maybe even seven. So,

169
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,280
I mean, bed by 11, 15, 11, 30. And, you know, I've watched a little John Stewart turn that off and,

170
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,680
you know, I'm drifting away. It goes pretty quick with me and my phone rings.

171
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,400
Now, this is not a normal time for my phone ring. I did know, however, that Patricia was on her way to

172
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
Rotterdam once again for more rehearsals. And I think she's doing the first, uh, she's recording two

173
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,280
shows for Dancing With The Star. So, it'll be the first show. And she calls me from the airport.

174
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,160
She says, okay, I forgot all my medicine. They have to know as, uh, as someone who has a

175
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,360
minor cardiac issues, heart medicine is pretty important to take with you. And, uh, I could get it to

176
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,080
or, you know, by tomorrow, but that doesn't really work. So, the plane is about to leave in like,

177
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,240
you know, 25 minutes. Um, Christina is still fast asleep because, you know, it was a really early

178
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,280
morning flight and Patricia's like, what the hell am I going to do? And, you know, I'm kind of

179
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,440
out of this dead sleep and like, uh, it's like, okay, what are we going to do? So it's like an hour.

180
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,280
So trying to figure that out, getting cabs to pick up medicine, rescheduling flights. Um, and, uh,

181
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,160
so it was, uh, once again, a short night. But, uh, it was just like one of those things, man.

182
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,720
Whenever, you know, this is really why when I'm at home, I don't want the phone anywhere near me

183
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,720
in the bedroom. I don't want to be able to hear the phone when I'm sleeping because there's nothing

184
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,360
I can do for you anyway. I'm asleep. You know, people have phones next to their bed.

185
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,800
Now, I can understand maybe for security reasons. You might want to be able to call out in the middle

186
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,880
of the night. But, you know, I just do not want any phones name because this always happens.

187
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,120
And so last night, a prime example, of course, but I have my phone next to my bed

188
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,880
when I'm here because, you know, I want to keep, keep tabs on my girls, and I want them to be

189
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,480
able to reach me. And that's not the only disturbing phone call I got.

190
00:20:51,520 --> 00:21:00,960
Okay, I don't know who this is or how you know to sell. But she's been gone now for four days.

191
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,040
So if he's there, or if he talked to her, tell her they're calling it right away.

192
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,200
That's pretty disturbing.

193
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,720
Is that the same? Let me just see if it's the same guy. Hold on a second. This is, uh,

194
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,880
I haven't over here. This is that guy when he was pissed off at,

195
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,680
and whoever he thought was calling to tell, let me listen to see if it's the same guy.

196
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,200
Hey, I don't know who this is, but stop fucking calling to sell, asshole.

197
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,760
Is that the same guy is this?

198
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Okay, I don't know who this is.

199
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,680
I don't know. Hmm, that doesn't sound like the same guy, is it?

200
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,080
Hey, I don't know who this is, but

201
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Hmm, or how you know to sell. Well, I maybe it is the same guy.

202
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,080
But she's been gone now for four days. So if he's there, or if he talked to her,

203
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,400
tell her they're calling it right away.

204
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Look, I'm not going to do any more outreach on this one, my friends. This is really freaking me out.

205
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
Please, feast your ears on this.

206
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,840
I wouldn't mind a couple more new operas. I don't have anything

207
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,760
All I want is I just want one of those for my own, the start's with

208
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,120
the world, the world, the world, the world, the culture of the series.

209
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
Or something like that.

210
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,160
So as always, when I'm feeling a little bit blue, and I just don't know what to do, I reach down deeper.

211
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,360
Excuse me, since I always blend up. It really throws me off well.

212
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,680
I'm good at this, almost insulting.

213
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Fuck me. I didn't work the way I wanted it to.

214
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
The opening of the show today was hooray for Hollywood by the Star Sisters.

215
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,640
That is one of Patricia's, the Lady Patricia's projects. A lot of you

216
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,760
called into the voicemail numbers. And I think what was it? Friday or something when I asked you

217
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,040
what this was? I'm just playing a little bit of it for you, okay?

218
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,560
Most of you got it, right? But you only got half of it, right?

219
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,400
And it wasn't date from 1969. Of course, that also is the Lady Patricia with the

220
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
Fisherman King, as many of you said.

221
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,760
Yes, indeed.

222
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,760
That's all. Yeah. What a lot of you don't know is that the band backing

223
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,200
her up there is none other than the world famous focus. And you probably got to be at

224
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,320
least born in the 60s. Before the 70s to even have an inkling of who

225
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,520
focus is or was young acrimon, some of you may recognize that name, focus known from

226
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,600
focus focus definitely a very tight world class band. And it was cool that the couple of you picked

227
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,200
up on that. I don't know, first time corner, I believe at least it's the DSC size tech.

228
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,920
I'm from Birmingham, England. Your logbooks, the form V5, she had to just describe the car,

229
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,000
you know, the CC, what kind of car is the engine number, stuff, etc.

230
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,840
Oh, I'm on there. Hope to see it. It's the big cool, the registration document as well.

231
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,960
It's the form which shows cool V5 at the top. It's usually a feet page dock opens out wide there.

232
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,360
Hope that helps. Bye-bye. Oh, uh, I think I'm a scruncher. Yeah, but I can't be asked.

233
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,960
Okay, then you probably are a scruncher.

234
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,680
So, you know, this is the, this is what I got to take care of when I get back.

235
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,440
Crap. Hey, those of you listening to us in serious satellite stars 102. The show's about to end

236
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,680
for you. So you're going to miss this awesome song, the Marcus couch sent to me from the scene

237
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,920
scene, which I'll play in just a couple of minutes. But there's a lot more cool stuff coming up for you guys.

238
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,120
So take care. I'm also looking for that song. I realized that I hadn't loaded it in. Oh, there it is.

239
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,120
I loaded it into into cast blaster. All right. So a lot of people, this is my registration

240
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,000
order. The license for my car and I live in the UK and they're asking for my log book.

241
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,840
And it turns out the log book is an old English phrase or that the haven't basically updated the

242
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,840
the forms to reflect what it really means. It's your registration is that you own the car.

243
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,840
So now I have to send my original insurance certificate. I have to send, well, I'm not supposed to

244
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,120
send. I'm not even supposed to have an MOT, which is a ministry of transportation like certificate

245
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,160
the car is roadworthy because it's new, you know, it's like a year old. It's a new car. So that's

246
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,640
kind of confusing. And then it's supposed to hand over my registration.

247
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,640
I don't know. It's the, you're busted, Jordi, Joseph, there's something in the, in a series of

248
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,200
minutes. And this isn't the thing I say. And it's just the main thing I forgot to remind you

249
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,120
of, do not, on any circumstances and you love to do to anybody. No matter how they are, never,

250
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,400
ever let that thing out you say. And you hand that door in the door, you've lost your car on the

251
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,200
mode basically person who then filled in that document then becomes the legal owner of it. You never,

252
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,960
ever, ever give it to anybody. So it will red tear off a little bit of the bottom, that's basically

253
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,400
the transfer of ownership and once that's gone, so as your car. Cheers, mate. Yeah, cheers, mate.

254
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,600
So is that officially a conundrum? Was that what it is? I think what it means is I can't just send

255
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,480
the shit via mail. I have to actually go to the some special post office. And what do you care?

256
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
And you just want to hear me bitch.

257
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,520
That's the number for everyone in the UK to call in. I think I've got it though.

258
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,760
I'll let you know how it goes when I get back next week and then take care of all that crap.

259
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:58,560
For those of you in the States, I've been honest, how often are you walking along and you

260
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:06,880
just start singing that tune to yourself plus one two one six two five six three five seven.

261
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,520
I've just wanted to tell everyone about it. So it's exciting. It doesn't mean it's just planned. I didn't

262
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,360
explain why I've got past it. We've just done, we are just done for my first video.

263
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm going to have some fun. I don't want to have video format. We've got six kind of tasks.

264
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,160
It's video problems. We've been doing some virtual slam. I'm pretty excited about this.

265
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,000
And it depends as we've got this time. I'll pull back a ton of what's in parent, you want to

266
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,680
meet him, see the name, don't stray far and the studio is prepared. You can check out my videos

267
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,480
and post what's on the slam either website. So go to there and now it's a slam. I don't

268
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,200
know how often it's been interesting to talk about. I have a slam either post or talk from

269
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,040
and I have one of the URL of the URL. What do you think of this video in text video and post what's

270
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:07,120
there? I think so. Well, I like it. Obviously. If you've never listened to the slam idle podcast,

271
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,840
you definitely should. And so now also with video. I think though Simon, you might want to choose

272
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:19,680
a little different background. Because you sent me this in video as well. You know, standing in front

273
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,240
like the door, I'd look kind of doorky. So choose your background carefully, my friend.

274
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,480
What's up, you guys? This is Evan from Cage 9 and you're listening to The Daily Source Code.

275
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:03,760
Frozen in my face beside this entire place. She's got to make she's got to make

276
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:12,640
she's got to make what she's right on time. Why? Because it's all in this time.

277
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:27,200
And she's feeling that she's so close in my eyes. But that's not too late. I'll get some deep

278
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,200
blades. And there's a way, a way, a way, a way for her to fly.

279
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,240
A last blow to buy.

280
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,640
She's got your friends, but you can't be sure.

281
00:29:52,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Because they're singing songs she's never had before. She's a dead piece, she's not dead.

282
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:18,240
And I think she's afraid I'm afraid to be rich enough. Why? Because it's all in pain.

283
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:26,240
And she's jealous. And I think it's a way, a way, a way for her to try.

284
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:39,600
But that's all too late. I'll get some deep blades. But that's a way, a way, a way for her to fly.

285
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:49,280
A last blow to buy. And I think she's running out for her to run fast.

286
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:59,280
And I think she's jealous. And I think it's a way, a way, a way for her to fly.

287
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,280
And I think it's a way, a way for her to fly.

288
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:15,280
And I think it's a way, a way for her to fly.

289
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:21,280
And I think it's a way, a way for her to fly.

290
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:29,280
And I think it's a way, a way for her to fly.

291
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:37,280
And I think it's a way, a way, a way for her to fly.

292
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,280
And I think it's a way, a way for her to fly.

293
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:53,280
And I think it's a way, a way for her to fly.

294
00:31:53,280 --> 00:32:01,280
And I think it's a way, a way, a way for her to fly.

295
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
And I think it's a way, a way, a way for her to fly.

296
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Crash. Ah, sorry.

297
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Cage 9. Now, that's the title of the talk.

298
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
That's a Friday show.

299
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Please, pilot error disregard.

300
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Yeah, Marcus Couch is bringing these guys on the pod safe music network.

301
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Cage 9 lasts a lot of buys what you heard.

302
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,280
And Friday will play another track that will be up on the PMN.

303
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Very cool.

304
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
I know that Marcus has been playing these guys.

305
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,280
So, I'll support it.

306
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Shipman, I'll support anything pod safe.

307
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Really, I will.

308
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,280
And I also support English Blokes calling up drunk.

309
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
I had a misparky.

310
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
It's a...

311
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Oh, yeah.

312
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
I'll say.

313
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
And I'm completely salted.

314
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
I've had a...

315
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,280
...absorbing marvelous afternoon, Tokyo.

316
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
We've, uh...

317
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,280
We met at the, uh, the greats in, uh...

318
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,280
Chef of Marcus, which is, quite in the race in, in the West End.

319
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,280
And then, uh, we went on for Matt as the, uh, brutal blow, which is, uh,

320
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
uh, since the white sausage.

321
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,280
Now, bear in mind that this is like a Friday night.

322
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,280
And the only thing, Parkie has...

323
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,680
I guess he has nothing better to do than to call me, call the voicemail, when he's drunk.

324
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:25,520
And then we had a marvellous afternoon, food and drink, and then we went on for a mess.

325
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:32,080
So I warned you about this phone call, and I'm absolutely, absolutely, also, B.B.

326
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,520
So this is Friday evening, and that's the rest of Friday evening, I'm absolutely slaughtered.

327
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,840
So how to show me nice whenever you get this, because I'm absolutely bugged.

328
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,000
Take care, bye-bye.

329
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,720
It's very interesting. Usually around Friday night, I usually get about, you know,

330
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,280
three or four calls like this, of guys just completely hammered, and they're all from the UK.

331
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,480
And they start, and you may be, it's because they can't help, but, you know, when you're drunk,

332
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,120
you start singing songs, and maybe they can't help, but sing along with this tune.

333
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:23,920
Plus four four, two, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, nine, three, plus four, four, two, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

334
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:33,680
All right, I got to get out of here. I'm still some, some chock-full days at, uh, at Potio HQ today.

335
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,120
And, uh, I should give you a real proper update of what's going on. Okay, let's

336
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,600
so tomorrow I won't do any, and I won't do a whole bunch of promo and feedback and crap like that.

337
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,840
I'll just tell you exactly what's happening with Potio, and what we're up to. I got, I got to really

338
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,680
make a list, so I can remember it all. So if you're interested, join me then. Otherwise, of course,

339
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,640
Friday will be back with the Fubar Friday festivities to get your music in for that as well.

340
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,440
Adam and Potio.com, send me some email, or check out anything you want to know about the show at

341
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,440
the show site, dating source code.com. Take care, everybody. Have a great Wednesday.

342
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,040
Another Potio Potcast. Stick it in your ear.
