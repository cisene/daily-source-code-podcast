00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Potcho is pleased to bring you the following killer content direct from the all new feature-richpotcho.com

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,480
Get it! Play it! Dig it! Dig it!

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,720
The third and fourth edition folder, for your own problems with your family.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,000
With 15 keys, a gun just stuffed in the truck.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,440
Bigel! The five packs are split up right out.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,560
We don't need no naked man!

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,080
It's Adam Curry. This is DSC 495.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,560
I was 16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,400
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,400
podcasting is Adam Curry. Adam Adam, a lot of curry.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,960
Podcasting from Gilford, a supper-look serving,

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,680
is shows called the Charlie DSC or the Chacha.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,080
He fires up slips in spite of the law.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,520
Ha! Travels the globe open new markets like Nixon.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,400
Plates for naked pictures from PMM fixings.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,720
Lady Patricia, how what can one say?

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
When she co-hosts it's just like a bright Sunday.

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,000
He's the pod father who normally isn't the one.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,560
Daughter Christina's PSTQ is such fun.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
She cracks on the pikes and likes to rock out.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,040
Something Adam's pink is going to fall in.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,400
That was all about.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,040
The penis sponsor is birthed in Go Daddy and Smanda.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,080
What's out five shows a week and sometimes a week end up.

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,920
His calls from CSB Uncle Jesse and some of them are odd.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,800
He's a confidate as his courtesy of Jersey Todd.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,920
The police hides might be red and he doesn't act hurried.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,480
Don't think that his podcasting vision is blurred.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,440
He has grand plans and great schemes even bolder.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,520
He's not a scruncher of a roller just upon a fight for me.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Yes, she avoids the sun is creeping in.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:10,480
Through that she cuts us onto the bed she's lying in.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:24,240
And with weary eyes she turns to the face of shame.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She can't hide the snow these skies with his.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:56,160
And now she cries to what she's lost with tears she whispered.

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:06,160
And in the dark the dead of night she holds his back.

38
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,000
Turn out the light.

39
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,340
Through the lijn and sheets,

40
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,800
you hit the lights a life bread.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:06,100
I'm a scar of the leaves she lies a secret

42
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:31,100
She can't let go, she can't let go, she can't let go

43
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:38,100
And now she cries through what she's lost

44
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,100
It's eerie eyes, she whispered

45
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:51,100
And in the dark, the dead of night

46
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,100
She holds his hand out the light

47
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,100
And now she cries through what she's lost

48
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,100
It's eerie eyes, she can't let go, she can't let go

49
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,100
And now she cries through what she's lost

50
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:23,100
It's eerie eyes, she whispered

51
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Yeah, I really don't know what it is

52
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Not actually, I think I do, I think it's the radio guy in me

53
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,100
When of the days get shorter, the nights get longer and darker

54
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
And the weather gets a little grisly

55
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Chili and rainy, you just want to pull out records that kind of reflect that mood

56
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Which of course completely breaks down if you're listening to the daily source code

57
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,100
In Australia, it's fucking summer over there

58
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,100
It's just years and years of doing the same, I can't really help myself

59
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
Hope you don't mind, and the pot's safe music network

60
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
That from the UK, the called Cedar Falls

61
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,100
It's the ballad for a lonely heart

62
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,100
What are we today, episode 4?

63
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
What are we saying?

64
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Crap, 4.95 already

65
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
Can you believe that?

66
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Although I must say, Patricia and I went into Gilbert into town yesterday

67
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,100
And it kind of feels like that season is upon us, you know?

68
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,100
You've got the commercials on television, you've got the lights that are being strung up

69
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,100
They haven't quite been lit yet, but

70
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,100
I don't know if I'm ready for that

71
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Tell us this

72
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

73
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Brand new week here on the daily source code

74
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Lots of stuff to talk about, had a nice weekend

75
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
I hope you had a really nice one

76
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Besides the debugging, which is continuous and ongoing

77
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,100
That's kind of my job to sit over here and debug a number of things

78
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,100
First of all, the UK site, I'm in a different time zone

79
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,100
So I also can do things when other people are catching up on some sleep

80
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,100
And just a whole bunch of little gnarly buggies, particularly the channels

81
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,100
And some feed stuff that got fixed over the weekend

82
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Which is really very nice to see all that

83
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
So now everything's updating across the board

84
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,100
I learned a couple things about the system which I didn't know

85
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
If you go to patcho.com you look at the homepage

86
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Now we have a, I think Cali Lewis intros

87
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Different piece of the site every day

88
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
And then there's a screen cast that goes along with it

89
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,100
The video page, which I believe goes up today or tomorrow

90
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
There's stuff in there that I didn't even know was there

91
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
It's really fantastic

92
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,100
So yesterday, yesterday we went town

93
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,100
We had a nice day together

94
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,100
I almost didn't do any work until

95
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,100
I think around, let's see, we got up, we had some like a late breakfast

96
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Then we went into town, we walked around, we shot

97
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,100
I bought Patricia a Tom Tom navigation system

98
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Now the Jaguar has a navigator

99
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Or what we call here in the UK

100
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Satinav, satellite navigator

101
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,100
But the interface, the input, the user interface

102
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,100
The way you input information is so completely wrong and confusing

103
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,100
And that's, you can even get over that

104
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,100
But the way it displays the information is just, it's just no good

105
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,100
I mean, it's a very expensive car

106
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
And the satinav is just shit

107
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
And they're all the same, all Jaguars

108
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
The crap, absolute crap

109
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,100
And these Dutch guys who created Tom Tom Go

110
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
I believe is the official name

111
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,100
You know, they've taken the world by storm with their systems

112
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,100
And let me tell you, they're doing more than just creating a satellite navigation system

113
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
If you haven't seen it, go to TomTom.com

114
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
I think it is TomTomGo.com

115
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,100
It has little suction cups you can stick it on the window

116
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,100
It's a nice, small display unit, all touch screen, very fast

117
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
But it connects to your phone

118
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,100
And this is, they're really going way beyond giving you satellite navigation information

119
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
It connects to your phone through Bluetooth

120
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,100
So you can use it as a speaker phone, you can access

121
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,100
In fact, I was able on the E61, able to access my text messaging

122
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,100
My address book, able to make calls, all hands free

123
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
It'll show you who's calling it

124
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
It's basically an extension of your phone screen

125
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Which is really fucking cool

126
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,100
And then it can use the data connection

127
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
To call out and get information

128
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,100
So I loaded it right up with all of the speed cameras

129
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Which it gives this knife a little

130
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Little radar warning blip

131
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,100
When you were in 500 feet of a speed camera

132
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
And there's a couple that I didn't even know

133
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,100
No, I'm not one who speeds off and of course

134
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
But I did find a couple that I didn't know about

135
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
It can get you weather, you can update the system

136
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,100
It's traffic obviously, it's really, really good shit

137
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,100
These guys are tying in all the bits, love that company

138
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,100
And all car manufacturers really need to take a good look at what they're putting in

139
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
System-wise

140
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I don't think I would buy a car with a built-in navigator

141
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
If I could leave it off, it was an option

142
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
If I could say just don't give it to me, I'll just put one of these in

143
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
I'm sure I would do it

144
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Not getting paid for that by the way

145
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
It's funny, now I got to display more what I'm not getting paid for

146
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
than what I am getting paid for

147
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,100
And so Saturday

148
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
The weather was not great

149
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Although the ceilings were good

150
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Broken cloud at 2,000 feet

151
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Scattered at 2.5,000

152
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,100
And then the ceiling was probably about 8 or 9,000

153
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Maybe even higher

154
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Yeah, 8 or 9,000

155
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,100
But there was wind and gusts

156
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Significant gusts, up to 35 knots

157
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
But I had a kind of like a

158
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,100
Well, I had a meeting with my banker, Ferdy

159
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
And those of you who listened to the show

160
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Or have ever seen any of my pictures, my flicker pictures

161
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
You've seen her pop up from time to time

162
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,100
She's been with us for seven years

163
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
And she's just fantastic

164
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
During the week, so she said I'll just come to

165
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Hill for some international airfield

166
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Which is a grass trip

167
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Just south of Amsterdam

168
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
So I'll come there, we'll have some lunch

169
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
She always had to go over a couple things

170
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,100
And I want to see her again too

171
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
That's always nice to get a personal meeting

172
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Up close and personal

173
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
And so Dan and I assessed the weather and said, screw it, let's go

174
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
We were doing

175
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Almost, we were doing 197 knots

176
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
On the way over, we made it from Farrow

177
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
To Hill for seven and an hour and ten minutes

178
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
So strong, of course we had the wing in the back

179
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,100
We were flyin' man, was that like 450 kilometers an hour?

180
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
It was fantastic

181
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Very, very bumpy, turbulent landing

182
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Because of the crosswind and the gusts

183
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I pulled it off okay, but man

184
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
I'd never been in that much crosswind before

185
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
And which is kind of the whole point of doing it

186
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
And having experience that

187
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
Have a nice lunch, she took some pictures

188
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Which I put up on, you can find it at curie.com

189
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
I added a flicker set

190
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,100
And so it was really a nice relaxing day

191
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Because when you're flying in general

192
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
But certainly in those conditions

193
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
You just can't think about anything else

194
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
But flying and it's so nice to just take your mind

195
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Completely off of everything

196
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
And I was very energized

197
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
To dive right back into bug stomping

198
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
And QA testing and doing all kinds of stuff

199
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Saturday night

200
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Oh no, good weekend and I hope yours was good as well

201
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
And even though we're busy

202
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
There are still lots of questions

203
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,100
You always bring the following camera content directly

204
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
I really got to change that

205
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Yeah, we're going to install our comment feedback system

206
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
The doesn't add a promo like that

207
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
So that's on the way

208
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
That's one of the things we're going to fix

209
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
So this audio of course came from the PDA

210
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,100
It was some positive here

211
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Just with a bit of quick feedback about the new push

212
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,100
So the new unbetter

213
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Is it like an extra level of unless or un-less level of beatiness

214
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Anyway

215
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,100
I know that you say that it is based on feedback directly from people

216
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
And so having heard that

217
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
I didn't bother saying this beforehand

218
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
And quite frankly that I have a lot of time to

219
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Give feedback anymore

220
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Anyway

221
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,100
So happy we could use some of your time then

222
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
You

223
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
You say it's for listeners

224
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
And I certainly have a listener

225
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I listen to a lot of what to us

226
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
And quite often I just like to

227
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Download an episode

228
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
And listen to it on my MPF player

229
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Which doesn't have Wi-Fi

230
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Or 3G or anything with it

231
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Yeah, I know

232
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Quite probably in the future that

233
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Will be something that MPF players can do

234
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
But at the moment

235
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
I just have to connect it to my computer

236
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
To get a podcast onto it

237
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
And

238
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
And there's nothing on pod show

239
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
That makes that easy

240
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,100
I still have to find the right show site

241
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,100
To find the RSS file

242
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
And then go into the RSS file

243
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
To find the MPF file

244
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
And then have to download it from there

245
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
This is really interesting

246
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Once I heard this bit of the piece of feedback

247
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
I knew that

248
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
That you've been

249
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Consuming podcasts for quite a while

250
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Maybe even making your own

251
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
Because anyone who knows to find

252
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
The RSS XML file

253
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
And then copy it

254
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
And then paste that into a browser

255
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Has been doing this for quite a while

256
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
And you know I'm going to

257
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
I'm going to finish a comment and then I want to respond to this

258
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Because this is really critical

259
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Very important

260
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
The link gets it

261
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Might make more sense as a link to the MPF file

262
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Or

263
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Something that would help it

264
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
And we download the podcast in

265
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Question because it's just

266
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
Still hard to

267
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
To download and listen to an episode

268
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Just one episode about having to

269
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Subscribe to the whole thing

270
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Of any of the podcasts

271
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
And you want people to be

272
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Other listen to these things

273
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
And not just at a computer

274
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Or at some fancy

275
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
3G wireless enabled mobile device

276
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
So

277
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Just something to think about

278
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
For your next level of unbeateness

279
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Just just make it easy for someone to download

280
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
One episode

281
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
That's all I'm asking for

282
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
As a listener

283
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
And a folder

284
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Thank you

285
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Good bye

286
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Oh man

287
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Okay, so you make a very good point

288
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
And I understand exactly what you're saying

289
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
And we did listen to feedback like this

290
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
That people wanted a way to just download the file

291
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
And

292
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
You know, don't think that a lot of

293
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Thought has not gone into

294
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
What we do and do not put within pod show

295
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Plus and why we do or do not put it there

296
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
And the most dangerous thing I found

297
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
And I fall into this all the time

298
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Is if you're used to doing things a certain way

299
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,100
It's very hard to see the simplicity of

300
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Something new

301
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
For example

302
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Before I switched over to Windows

303
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I'd been a

304
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
At least a 15 year long

305
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Mac user

306
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
And my previous experience with Windows

307
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Had been

308
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Windows 95

309
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Windows 98

310
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
I actually used for quite a while when we had

311
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Think new ideas

312
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
And

313
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
I think

314
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
NT3.1

315
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
But really Windows 98

316
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
And I don't think I've ever even played with XP

317
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Except maybe briefly

318
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
But not really use it as an operating system

319
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
More just as a system to run cast blaster

320
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
And

321
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
My perception

322
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Of Windows is that it was very complicated

323
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
And there was lots of

324
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
You know things you had to do differently

325
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
And shit that didn't work

326
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
And even the

327
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
The five dot three naming convention

328
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Was still kind of stuck in my head

329
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Remember that where you couldn't name a file

330
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
With any spaces or anything like that on Windows

331
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
To this day I still find myself

332
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Not

333
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Writing a file name

334
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
With spaces for fear that one thing with

335
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
And Windows will not be able to

336
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Understand the space in the

337
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
In the path to the file

338
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
And it will break something

339
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
And it's just something that's in

340
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Great even though I don't have to

341
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Manipulate myself into doing that

342
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Because that's been fixed

343
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
And this two with podcasting

344
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
We're so used to

345
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,100
Finding an orange and white XML icon

346
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Which I think was the worst marketing exercise

347
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
And technology history

348
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Because you basically click on that

349
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
As someone who doesn't know what's going on

350
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
You get this page of what looks like code

351
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Or a

352
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Just a play link which is a

353
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Direct link to the MP3 file

354
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Boy you can get different results there

355
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Can't you? It might open up the file

356
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,100
And your Windows media player

357
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
It might open up a new web page

358
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Or a tab with a quick time plugin

359
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Very dissatisfying experiences

360
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
As far as I'm concerned

361
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
We really did a lot of testing with people who

362
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Were not familiar with all of these

363
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
I'll just call it the baggage of podcasting

364
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
If you will or the baggage of

365
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Indicated content

366
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Because that's really what it is

367
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100
We have to move one step beyond

368
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
So when someone comes into pod show

369
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Plus and they see a very simple play it

370
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,100
I think that kind of solves the first

371
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Issue of I just want to play something

372
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Then if you want to

373
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Subscribe to something

374
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
We've even taken the subscription moniker

375
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Because it's just to complicate

376
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
People think it costs money and they stay away from it

377
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
This is from tests really user tests

378
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
And not small ones either

379
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
You know we really do evaluate this stuff

380
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
New people not all people not

381
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Exit not podcasters not people who have been

382
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Listening and and chugging along

383
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
And copying links and being heroic at

384
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Getting this content delivered to them

385
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,100
So when you click on play it

386
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
It opens up what we call the mashboard

387
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
And no one has complained about that

388
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Everyone loves the new layout

389
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Love the organization

390
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
And right there is a link that says download

391
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
So if you want to download it

392
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
You click on that file and it will download

393
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,100
To your wherever you have your download set

394
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
So usually to your desktop

395
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
So that's where we solved it

396
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,100
I don't believe that people are

397
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Looking for the experience anymore

398
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Of clicking on a link and then having

399
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Something unrelated

400
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,100
Almost happened playing a file

401
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Within a quick time plugin

402
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
And a big white page just doesn't

403
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Makes sense to me from a media perspective

404
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
So that's why

405
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
We don't put the download link

406
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Right there underneath play it

407
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
It may be handy for you

408
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,100
But I think it's you know this one

409
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Extra click to get to the download link

410
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,100
And you know you could of course

411
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Subscribe with a number of different programs

412
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
To get it onto your

413
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
On to your portable device

414
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
And we actually have a little

415
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Widget for that in the works to make that even easier

416
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100
But the way things are going

417
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,100
We feel that we've made the right choices

418
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
And we have done it based upon

419
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Audience feedback and you don't sound to me

420
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Like your typical audience member

421
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,100
I think you've been along for the ride for a while

422
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
So again, just think of things that

423
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
You were completely convinced

424
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Would just suck about a product or a service

425
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Because you've experienced it

426
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
In the past

427
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
And what's another good example

428
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Like

429
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
The MSN, MSN chat

430
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Oh man, that used to suck so bad

431
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
And I've really stayed away from it

432
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
And except I installed it recently

433
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Because that's what Christina uses

434
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
And I see all these changes and all these upgrades that I've been made

435
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
And I think you know I've been such an early adopter

436
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,100
That the big massive people who are now seeing this type of

437
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Channel application are seeing it in a whole different light

438
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
And are getting a whole different experience

439
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
From the get go

440
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
So it's really about the experience that audience members

441
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Who are not familiar with how it works under the hood

442
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,100
It's really what they're looking for

443
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100
They just want to point and click experience

444
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,100
And I would have to be very honest with you that

445
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Obviously for mobile devices

446
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
We have two main focuses

447
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
One is the iPod and iTunes

448
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Which we support fully

449
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Right down to the iTunes namespace in the RSS

450
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
And the other would be mobile devices

451
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Because it looks like Microsoft

452
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Is not going to be supporting podcasting in the next year or so

453
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
And this is purely because of time

454
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,100
It wasn't talking about the zoom that it's not supporting podcasting

455
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
No, it's not

456
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
And it doesn't do a whole bunch of really cool things

457
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Like synchronized wirelessly through Wi-Fi

458
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Which I believe technically it has the capability

459
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
I think it has the hardware

460
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
No one's really told me if it was a Wi-Fi connection that's in there

461
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
But it's kind of the same thing

462
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
This is

463
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,100
What can we do to actually support that device

464
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
I have some ideas

465
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
They will support podcasting

466
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
They just didn't have time

467
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
They didn't need to get something out quickly

468
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
And they kind of followed the route of let's license

469
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
They made some

470
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Not very courageous decisions

471
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
Let's put it that way

472
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
And I think that they underestimate

473
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,100
The power of podcasters

474
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
If podcasters could

475
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Have had and maybe they still can have some influence

476
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,100
On what the zoom will do

477
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,100
In regards to podcasters

478
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Oh man, I mean talk about some major adoption

479
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Talk about people with real audiences

480
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Who can really promote a product that they would love

481
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
What an opportunity, what a missed opportunity

482
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,100
I don't know how I got there

483
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
You know what?

484
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
I would like to hear what you have to say about it

485
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
We got the voice mail lines wide open of course

486
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,100
6-2-5-6-3-5-7

487
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Good old Peter

488
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Who like he has nothing better to do on his weekends

489
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,100
He said hey man, you never mentioned the UK number anymore

490
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
It's probably because you don't have a phone jingle

491
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
So let me do one for you

492
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:37,100
4-2-0-7-6-8-1-3-7-5-3

493
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
Ah, you are just too kind here

494
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Oh man

495
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
You open up the door and he comes right in

496
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,100
But in a close window

497
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,100
The satellite repairman

498
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Coming after you

499
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
The satellite repairman

500
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
What's he gonna do?

501
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,100
He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions

502
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Dude, there's nothing in the universe

503
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
And he can't do for you

504
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
The satellite repairman

505
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
The satellite repairman

506
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
That's right everybody

507
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Uncle Jesse, I'm the way to close satellite window

508
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
And have so much more to do

509
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
I got Roger Smalls

510
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
I've got an awesome song

511
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Another pot-safe song coming up

512
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Ah, a response from

513
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
Ah, from the inside works folks

514
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,100
About about port city PD

515
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Unfortunately, you're going to miss that

516
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
If you're listening to this on

517
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Serious satellite radio

518
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Channel stars 102

519
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
So be sure to go over to dailysourceco.com

520
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
To download the show

521
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
You can find it from the handy download link on the

522
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
Mashboard after you click play it

523
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
Take care, bye

524
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Meanwhile, you guys are still here

525
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
And this young man

526
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
How's he going?

527
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
Thanks a million for saying

528
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Liberty Jones

529
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
And that your support

530
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
And all the podcasts is getting behind this

531
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
It's been massive help

532
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
We're playing podcast convention

533
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Accessfield in London on the 18th of this month

534
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
He's coming along

535
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,100
And he's trying to introduce us

536
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,100
We'd be really faced

537
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
And so

538
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
That's right

539
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
And catch you down

540
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Cheers bye

541
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
That's so cool

542
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
So the shakes

543
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
And I wonder sometimes

544
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I'm so tuned into the

545
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
To the accent

546
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
That I understand that perfectly

547
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Excuse me, since I was blind

548
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
I should be saying

549
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Folders with Splendid, I guess

550
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
I don't know, not paying me

551
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Yeah

552
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I was wondering if you can always

553
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Understand what the if you're in the US

554
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
What the English folks are saying

555
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Because sometimes it sounds

556
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
A little rough through the phone

557
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
But anyway, shakes performing at podcasts

558
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
On UK

559
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
This coming Saturday the 18th

560
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
As far as I know

561
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
I'm in pocket

562
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
I'm going to be there

563
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
We're going to finalize plans

564
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
I think I just might go

565
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,100
I don't know if I should go next week

566
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Because next week is kind of like

567
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
Thanksgiving week

568
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
I'm just not sure

569
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
I have half a mind to go next week

570
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
Maybe visit some family for Thanksgiving

571
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
And then stay

572
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
The next week

573
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
And then come back

574
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Which will make it a little

575
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,100
Make it a December

576
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Or maybe I go this after Thanksgiving

577
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
That's right

578
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
And stay the first week of December

579
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Something like that

580
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Just before Christmas

581
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
I want to get a visit in

582
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
I have no idea why I said that

583
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm spacing out a little bit today

584
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Let me see what else I have on my list

585
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
I had some things I wanted to mention

586
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Oh yeah

587
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Catscast

588
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
Catscast.podshow.com

589
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,100
She put in some old footage

590
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,100
From when we did a live broadcast

591
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,100
From Vegas

592
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
You should definitely see that

593
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,100
If you want to see more embarrassing shots of me

594
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
At the time I married

595
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Seven couples

596
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Who were prize winners

597
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
That's a promotion man

598
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
That's the kind of stuff I love doing

599
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
We got to do some more of that

600
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
Yeah

601
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
That's the kind of stuff I love doing

602
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
We got to do some more of that

603
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
She's ready

604
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Y'all

605
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Here's another message

606
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Wrong

607
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Rages

608
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
No

609
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
No

610
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Rages

611
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Rages

612
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
No

613
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Stop

614
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Hey, I don't like your hair

615
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Just be listening to your argument with Patricia

616
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
On four nights free

617
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
About British and shit

618
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
I just like to confirm that you're right

619
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
You're not flat to share an erect penis

620
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
On television

621
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
On many branches

622
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
On many branches

623
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
On many branches

624
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
On many branches

625
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
On every branch

626
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
My hard work

627
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Well, of course

628
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Thanks

629
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
So thank you

630
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Mr.

631
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:12,420
I tell you what, if you come up to me at podcastcon, UK, this coming Saturday, I will give

632
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,460
you my new address because I'd love to meet you.

633
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,660
Everybody wants to meet Roger Smalls and isn't it interesting how you don't hear from

634
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
the guy from months?

635
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,420
I'm telling you what, three months at least, Roger and then all of a sudden, just around

636
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:31,580
the time that there's an event happening podcastcon, UK, it starts to kind of heat up a

637
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,220
little bit and sometimes I wonder if that isn't by design.

638
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,540
You're not just your regular run of the mill stalker but something special going on.

639
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,540
Why?

640
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,100
In fact, I know there's something special going on with you, Roger.

641
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,500
Yes, censorship in the UK, I've got a lot of response on that people, a lot of people

642
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,300
mention that indeed you are not allowed to show a fully-recpiness on television or I guess

643
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:01,120
not in any other type of publication in the UK is that true or in the changing room

644
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,320
with more suspense, especially the Guilford Branche.

645
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,720
He has indeed Roger, I'm sure that's a problem.

646
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:14,260
Speaking of censorship, last week I received a piece of audio feedback from Robin and

647
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,460
Suzanne from InsideWorks and we've had lots of these delayed back and forth conversations

648
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,140
between shows, particularly here on the source code and they were very offended about the

649
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,660
promo that we were running for port city PD, our new cop show which you can find at port

650
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,660
citypeditapodshow.com, it's a great show.

651
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,140
They said it couldn't be on the homepage and I basically threw it back at them and said,

652
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,500
hey, look, it sounds like you guys got some baggage and you're projecting that onto me and

653
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,100
these are your personal issues and that we don't censor content.

654
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,740
We want everyone to have a fair shake no matter what it is.

655
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:55,100
We should have the bedtime stories, my kids read, that should be on the homepage but it

656
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,660
needs to be switched around.

657
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:02,820
We need to be able to get the audience that is out there, this is craving for stuff and

658
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,340
when it was deeper into it, I said, hey, port citypedita, you know that violence, you know.

659
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,580
And what is violence, you know, do you see any blood in the promo now?

660
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,540
Your average one of the day, you know, episode of cops is more violent than that.

661
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,660
It's also real and they responded, which is really nice.

662
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,820
Hi, Adam, this is Suzanne and Robin from InsightWorks and the Deva cast and we want to

663
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:34,100
respond to your DSC 492 from 8 November regarding our thoughts on port cityped.

664
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:40,740
Suzanne and I've talked a lot about this since you're a lot, Adam, thanks for not censoring

665
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
us.

666
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
Thank you.

667
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,580
Well, we realized as we came to this from different perspectives, Suzanne and I,

668
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,020
number one, Suzanne is anti violence.

669
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,580
Number two, I was approaching it from a business perspective.

670
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,940
And number three, we had a couple things in common that we really felt about that promo.

671
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:05,180
So first, Adam, regarding me and my anti violence stance, I realized you are so right.

672
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,580
Oh, my gosh, this is my stuff.

673
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,980
I own it.

674
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,900
It's my baggage that I was trying to thrust upon you.

675
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,660
So thank you for pointing that out to me and what I really had to figure out was why I was

676
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:27,780
doing that and what I've concluded is, as a family therapist, I am saturated with violence

677
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
and my day-to-day work.

678
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,860
I work with battered women, inner city kids, right now I'm working with clients in the

679
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,100
judicial system.

680
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,220
I see a lot of stuff.

681
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:42,340
So for me then, when I want to watch something to relax and for entertainment, it's really

682
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,100
uncomfortable for me then to go and sit watch anything else that's more violent because

683
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,340
I feel like I kind of live that.

684
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,180
So that you are so right, it is my stuff.

685
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,900
And for me, I watched Port City PD, one of the episodes I liked it.

686
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,460
Well, actually, I did too.

687
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,540
So I'm not nearly as anti violence as Suzanne and I'm not.

688
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,540
Well, it wasn't very violent.

689
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,100
You know, when I actually watched it, it wasn't very violent.

690
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Right.

691
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,900
From my perspective, I was more concerned about the business aspect of having that

692
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,940
promo on the front page of Potcho.

693
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,500
I like the diversity within Potcho.

694
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,740
That's what I want to convey is, I'm not against any content in the Potcho system.

695
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
I'm not.

696
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
I think it's fantastic.

697
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,580
That's what's going to make Potcho bigger and better.

698
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,540
And it's a symbiotic relationship.

699
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,860
When I grow my audience, it helps Potcho when Potcho has a bigger audience.

700
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,740
I have the opportunity for new audience members.

701
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,100
So it's a benefit to all of us.

702
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
I like the diversity.

703
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,420
I don't want to censor any of it.

704
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,860
From the business perspective, I see that front page of Potcho has been a really

705
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,300
critical space.

706
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,060
And people will judge what's beyond that page by what's on the page.

707
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,260
It's a delicate balance.

708
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,580
I really don't know the answer.

709
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,460
I have noticed in the past, if I remember right,

710
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:11,060
when Mark Yoshimura Nemkoff had wears my fucking latte, when the promo first came out,

711
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,460
it was fucking.

712
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,340
And now it's f-striking.

713
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,380
So somewhere it changed, I don't know.

714
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,220
I just got a jump in there.

715
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,060
This is lovely, guys.

716
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:29,100
I think, as far as I know, Mark Yoshimura Nemkoff censored that himself, the reason

717
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,780
I believe was to be able to get it onto iTunes.

718
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,700
So I think he censored it for iTunes to pick it up, otherwise it's not even the explicit

719
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
label doesn't work.

720
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,700
They just won't display it.

721
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,700
I believe that's what's happening.

722
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,780
But I'm sure Mark will correct me if I'm wrong in that.

723
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,100
But as far as I know, obviously no censorship from Potcho on that.

724
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,540
Well, I think it was your censorship.

725
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,540
That's for sure.

726
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,980
But something changed.

727
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,980
And so I just approach the whole thing from that business perspective.

728
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Right.

729
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,900
But what we do agree on Adam is no censorship.

730
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,180
And when you use that word, that really stunned for me, because I thought, oh my God,

731
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,660
you're calling me on my stuff.

732
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,180
And how could I be censoring something?

733
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,700
Robin and I were both active, duty, military.

734
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,660
We fought for the right for people for our first amendment and to be able to burn the flag.

735
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,860
And a few years ago, remember hunting when we got into a big debate.

736
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,020
We got into an argument with some other people.

737
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,540
They want to do have legislation so that people could not burn the flag.

738
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,340
And I said, that's insane.

739
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:33,500
It is exactly what this country is about to have the right to say what and do what you want

740
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
to do.

741
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,380
Last thing I wanted to bring up was grief.

742
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:42,900
I do my very best not to judge anybody else's pain.

743
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,660
The death of your mom, the death of my mom, we have both suffered a huge loss.

744
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,740
And I make no judgments that yours was any worse than mine or mine was any worse than yours.

745
00:34:53,740 --> 00:35:00,540
So Adam, thank you for listening to us and helping us get clarity on our own thoughts.

746
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,740
I'm sorry if we exasperated you, but we sure appreciate your time and energy in responding

747
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,740
to us.

748
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,140
Thanks so much and bye for now.

749
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Love you, man.

750
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
They'll win.

751
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,220
You know, I love you guys too.

752
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:17,620
And I really mean it because you made some real from the heart comments.

753
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,700
I was able to make some real from the heart from the soul comments back.

754
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,100
And we've come to some resolution here.

755
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,900
We still kind of agreed to disagree.

756
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,100
That's okay.

757
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
But you're right.

758
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
It is totally all about balance.

759
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,060
And you know, it's everything we do is about a balance.

760
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,900
That's what I guess what media is in a way, you know, because everybody's different

761
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,220
and you want to be able to reach as many people as possible and send them in the direction

762
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,020
they want to go.

763
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,620
I don't want to force anything on anyone.

764
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,900
I don't want people to have to watch something that they don't want to.

765
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:57,660
But yet there's a, there is a fine line between serendipity and discovery and searching

766
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,500
and context and all of those things.

767
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,180
And, you know, we're finding our way too and it ain't easy.

768
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,100
But this type of feedback helps.

769
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,740
There's a lot of feedback that really, really has helped tremendously that I've received

770
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,820
over, over the course of our unleashed.

771
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,420
And another one I'm going to play for you right after this, which I think you're like,

772
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,660
I liked it a lot.

773
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,460
But first something else from the Pod Save Music Network, which is also close to my

774
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:26,340
heart from the Sunshine Variety Club, simply titled Green.

775
00:36:47,660 --> 00:37:02,860
I like Green.

776
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:11,780
When I think of all the colours in my rainbow, it's only one thing.

777
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:41,060
That's right, me too.

778
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,980
The Bond Mix of the Sunshine Variety Club's Green.

779
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,540
And I'm just noticing something on the Pod Save Music Network.

780
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:55,300
I guess we have the option to sell a track now enabled for any artist to sell their

781
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,820
stuff, 99 cents for any track you find on the Pod Save Music Network.

782
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,420
You get a little store, so a little area.

783
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,780
So if you buy something, you can go back and download it again and again and again.

784
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:12,020
That's DRM-free MP3, which means the artist is building up a trust relationship with

785
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
you.

786
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,020
Pod Show takes nothing of that money.

787
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,420
Nine cents goes to the transaction company and the full 90 cents is passed on to the

788
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
artist.

789
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:28,380
We will make fees available for people to hell is that, oh, it's the last one, hold on one

790
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,380
second.

791
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,380
That's a big funny.

792
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,380
Hey, moody.

793
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,900
I'm recording the source code, man, can I call you right back?

794
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,140
The hell are you doing up?

795
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,140
It's early.

796
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
I didn't run.

797
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,140
Screw that.

798
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,140
Okay, buddy.

799
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
I'll call you back in about half an hour.

800
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:49,020
I don't know where anybody is these days.

801
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
He's in London.

802
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
Sorry about that.

803
00:38:52,020 --> 00:39:03,220
So what I don't know yet is if this bylink is also surfacing on Pod Show.com slash music,

804
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,580
you don't have to check that out.

805
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,020
I hope it does because that's kind of the whole point.

806
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
That's really the listener side.

807
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,020
But it is surfacing.

808
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,020
It is working.

809
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,020
So if you have tracks on the Pod Show music network, you want to sell it.

810
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,820
You want to get 90 cents per track, not a problem.

811
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,380
It's just a matter of ticking off a box on each track that you want to put up for sale.

812
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,420
All right, one last one about the unbated.

813
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,020
This one I thought was pretty cool and just goes to show how, even how obvious things

814
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
are how people still don't see them.

815
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,020
And it's not their fault.

816
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,860
It's completely our fault.

817
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,020
Hey Adam, it's Chip from Top of the Pod SACE.

818
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,580
First of all, I want to commend you with a wonderful job everybody's done with the Pod

819
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,580
Show.

820
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,220
Plus, unbated version, it's exactly what everybody's been asking for.

821
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
It's amazing.

822
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
I'm loving it.

823
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:53,900
I love going on the Pod Show.com slash music part of it and looking down at the bottom

824
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
right.

825
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,060
You can just refresh the web page and you get a different top 10 list every time.

826
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,540
Like Top 10 Accapellas or something like that.

827
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,620
That's really, really cool.

828
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,700
Plus, I've been messing with my profile and my shows profile that set it up even better.

829
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:12,780
And it's easier to use than the original version was, the beta version.

830
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,780
So hats off to you and everybody.

831
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,380
I know everybody's been working hard and probably everybody's gained a lot of gray hairs

832
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,380
from it.

833
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,580
But it's really paying off.

834
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,580
It really is.

835
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,700
I got a question for you because I know that you use cast blaster and I've been using it

836
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:34,540
for a while now and love it and I really enjoy the live vibe that I get from doing

837
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,540
it even though I'm not very professional at what I do.

838
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:44,420
But I haven't been able to figure out how to do this one thing.

839
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,740
And that is to use the full functionality of cast blaster.

840
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:55,100
Right now what I do is I'm making MP3 with cast blaster and I save it to a file and then

841
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,980
I use that file to go into the pod show plus.

842
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:06,220
I'll write my show notes including the hyperlinks and I'll paste it into the online area

843
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,940
on pod show and then attach the MP3 to it in upload.

844
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:16,140
But I know in the configuration of cast blaster there's an area in the bottom right

845
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,580
that says server and it has an address you can put in your email address or password and

846
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,660
then there's a little box to click that says use pod show servers.

847
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,820
And then you should be able to I guess publish it and instead of hit and save as in the

848
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,820
save show you could actually upload the show to the server directly.

849
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,940
Now how do you do that?

850
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,380
What is the address that everyone needs to search for to do that and pass wars and all that

851
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,380
kind of stuff?

852
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,660
I'm so glad you asked this okay so this is what's kind of interesting.

853
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,540
This is definitely not clear in the application I'm just going to go to the configured

854
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,060
tab here.

855
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,540
So it says server of course you know I think there it should give a little more on those

856
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,420
let's see what's in the help hold on a second.

857
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:07,620
Mike has always done a good job of help let's see under Configure let me go to server.

858
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,820
Here's server.

859
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:16,060
Enter your podcast server details here address is the URL of the server example www.mysite.com

860
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,860
slash my podcast user is your login name password is your password note that the download

861
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,140
path is often not the same as the upload path for example if your podcasts are being downloaded

862
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,140
from blah blah blah blah okay so we have to work on that particular piece of help I don't

863
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,220
think that really is saying what's happening there.

864
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,580
Let me explain it to you if you would just play along with me for a second go to the Configure

865
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:48,300
tab in in Casplaster so that's server part now you can actually enter a FTP server in the address

866
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:56,700
so if you would have so for instance I have what is it let's just say I have FTP.curry.com

867
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:03,460
so there I'd put FTP.curry.com and then my email address that is also incorrect that would

868
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:09,140
typically be then the user name and password would be the password and so what it does is

869
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,460
when you click publish first you save the file then you upload the server it will open an

870
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,980
FTP connection shoot that up to the FTP server put it in the proper place as defined by

871
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:25,460
the path in the address and you know just basically upload your show there and then you still

872
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,740
have to do all the manual you know linking to it etc. from a web page and you still have

873
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,980
to do the RSS feed if you want people to be able to subscribe to it so if you click use

874
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,700
podshow servers pdn the address field you get a whole bunch of asterixes and then you enter

875
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:52,260
your basically your your podshow credentials so your my login is adam at curry.com that's why

876
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,460
it says email address because your your login on podshow plus is your email address that you

877
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:03,220
supplied when you signed up and the password is the password that's associated with it that's how

878
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:11,540
you configure it and that's how you get upon clicking the publish button that's how it then

879
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:18,340
gets sent up to the podshow delivery network and how it automatically is added to your list of

880
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:24,020
shows the show is put into your RSS feed and well I think you're gonna be able to get it to work

881
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:32,980
also if I put my show notes in the cast blaster show notes and I do get this upload functionality

882
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:39,220
to work will the show note show up just like as if I was doing it in the version I do now with the

883
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:44,340
hyperlinks and all that kind of stuff in there just curious on your comments with that oh by the way

884
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:50,740
also I've got another another question for you hold on let me address this first so yes the answer is

885
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:57,540
when you do that not only does the file get uploaded and inserted into your RSS feed but everything

886
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:05,300
you have under the described tab so the title the episode subtitle summary the show notes the

887
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:11,300
tags all of those are filled out on your episode page automatically so you only have to do it once you'll

888
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:17,540
also see in there under show if you have more than one show you can select a different show to upload to

889
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:24,740
now all of this metadata by the way is also written into the ID3 tags of the file so if you open that

890
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:31,220
up on a player that understands how to read this data it will show all of that including the image

891
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,980
that you put into it that'll be the album art and although it's already working under the hood and

892
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,860
hasn't quite surfaced yet on pod show plus the image art will also be associated with each episode

893
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:48,740
on the web page so it'll actually be pulling that out as well so it is a beautiful process created by

894
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:54,180
people who make podcast myself as a primary tester but if you go to castblaster.com

895
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,580
there's a great lively community there for them with people talking about all kinds of stuff in

896
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,740
fact there's already a pro version in the works of which I have an alpha version haven't really

897
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:08,660
had the time to mess with it in a real life production situation because you know it's alpha so it

898
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,900
could mess up and I usually when I'm doing the show I'm fitting it in between doing a whole

899
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,940
bunch of other things so I just didn't have the time to really do it properly and for what I see

900
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:24,100
Mike is also working on a video version of castblaster so it's quite a powerful platform and the

901
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:31,380
beauty of it is it's all in one self-contained little beautiful package you record you click save

902
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:38,580
you I always like having a copy on my hard drive and you hit you know upload to server it's done

903
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:43,620
it's it's published everything is taken care of no more copying pacing of any stuff it's just

904
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,900
in there it works and it's a beautiful thing you had one more thing I'm an ass cruncher but a

905
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:55,700
nose folder so does that mean I need to search for professional help anything you can say to me

906
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:01,860
with help a lot thank you it's interesting because I too have noticed that I have cruncher tendencies

907
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:10,260
as I am an ass folder and a nose cruncher the interesting isn't it maybe we should seek help

908
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:20,260
maybe we should all right everybody that's it for today I'll be back tomorrow with another source

909
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:26,100
code will be up to 496 working on the 500 not doing not I don't have anything special plan but

910
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:34,740
