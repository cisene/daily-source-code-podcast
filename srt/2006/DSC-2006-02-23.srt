00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-4-1, this podcast is not family safe.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,600
Well, Adam, since you appeared to be clueless in this regard, I've compiled a list of why

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
you are so despised.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,400
I now give you the top 10 reasons why we hate Adam Curry.

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,360
Number 10, he used to work at MTV when MTV was still cool.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,960
And as host of Headbangers Ball, arguably, he had the coolest job in MTV also.

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Number 9, he is married to a beautiful former pop star.

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,120
Who drives a Jaguar and has her own cosmetic company.

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,480
Number 8, he is gorgeous.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:16,680
Over six feet tall with roguish, good looks and a full head of thick blonde.

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,040
You know, fuck the list, I'll tell you what I hate you, Adam Curry.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,200
You're always prancing about, look at me, I'm Adam Curry.

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,680
I can speak five languages, I fly planes and helicopters.

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,240
Look at me, I'm Adam Curry.

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,360
I've partyed at the MTV Beach House and the Playboy Mansion.

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm Adam Curry, I co-invented podcasting.

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,640
I was in a movie with Sean Penn and Elizabeth Herley.

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,400
And I was also in Truth or Dare with Mandala.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,280
I had my own TV series.

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm so rich and bloody fucking successful in popular.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,760
I've got my own stalker.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,640
And, and if that wasn't enough, my last house, my last house was a fucking castle.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,280
You've got some sort of magnet of vacuum that sucks away all the good fortune that

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,720
was intended for the rest of us regular guys.

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,880
You're taking more than your fair share.

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,360
Well, fuck you, Adam.

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
Fuck you in the plane, you flew in on.

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
Headwind, headwinds, Adam.

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,720
I want my hair back.

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,280
I want my hair back, you selfish bastard.

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,080
Oh, I swear I wouldn't do this.

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,600
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Turn me this.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,360
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

36
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Oh, I guess it is Adam Curry.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:08,680
If I feel it's feeling, if I let myself go deep again, we'd stay by my side.

38
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:16,520
If I feel it's feeling, then don't ever be the same again.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,240
Let's cut our own love, don't I'll be flying.

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,400
Cause I can't sleep inside of you.

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,600
I can't feel your undermore.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,440
I can't sleep inside of you.

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,120
But I don't mind if I'm inside of you.

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:04:02,120
You're my rally show Are you the answer to my question?

45
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Have I wasted my time now?

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Cause if I feel this feeling,

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Call all of your first year next year

48
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm calling the rally show

49
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Will you be my light?

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Cause I can't see someone

51
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,120
I can't feel someone

52
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,120
I can't see someone

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,120
But I don't run

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,120
You're by my side, I feel fine

55
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,120
I'll be fine

56
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
I'll be fine

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:02,120
I'll be fine

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Can you show it to you to me?

59
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Hey, show it to me

60
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,120

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,120

I can't feel someone

65
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,120
I can't see someone

66
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
But I don't mind

67
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I go blind

68
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,120
I can't see someone

69
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,120
I can't feel someone

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,120
I can't see someone

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,120
But I don't mind

72
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,120

I'll be fine

78
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
I'll have from Montana

79
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,120
They call themselves Black Lab

80
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
See the sun

81
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,120
And boy, do I ever

82
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Sun just coming up here in Northern California

83
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,120
The Curricando Hey everybody, how you doing?

84
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Time once again for the Daily Source Code

85
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
It is a little bit later than normal

86
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
It's a 7 a.m. I got up at 6

87
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
And of course, this is time to late

88
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,120
For those of you sitting on Syria saying, wait a minute

89
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
It's not 7 a.m.

90
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
No, this is the podcast

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,120
A synchronous entertainment in your ears

92
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
People ask me yesterday

93
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Why I sounded like shit

94
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
And the only thing I can think of

95
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Is that I just have this incredible cold

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
I don't know if it's the air conditioning

97
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Or if it's just the, I could be the avian flu

98
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Of course

99
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
If it's just the stuff that's going around

100
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
And around and around

101
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Will we ever get out of this cycle of

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Drippy noses

103
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
So I got up this morning 6 o'clock

104
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm ready to put the charted together for you

105
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
And you always love to check my email

106
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Because you know Patricia's completely email

107
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Savvy now that she has her G5

108
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm back

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
And so the first thing she says is

110
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Hey, you're

111
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Just get my, my cub here

112
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
So the first thing she said is hey

113
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
You're official

114
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Your new license came

115
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
That'll be my pilot's license

116
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
I've been waiting for

117
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Christ and it's almost six months

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Six months to get a new

119
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
An actual piece of plastic that says

120
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
That I am both certified for

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Rotaries

122
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
For helicopters and for fixed wing

123
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
And it finally came

124
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
I must say though

125
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Your government at work man

126
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
If you go to the FAA website

127
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
And you send them an email

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Or you click on their feedback form

129
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
They do get in touch with you pretty quick

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Because they sent it to the wrong address

131
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Or something like that

132
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Anyway

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
It's snowing

134
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
In it

135
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
It's snowing in the United Kingdom

136
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Today, at least in

137
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
In Guildford

138
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
So it's so weird man

139
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
And so now we've had this beautiful

140
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Weather out here in San Francisco

141
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
Not that it's really warm

142
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
But the sun is shining right now

143
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
It's once again

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
It's coming up over the bay

145
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
It's just flooding the entire condo

146
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
It's

147
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
It's great

148
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,120
And there was another email that came in

149
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
I was from my, from my attorneys

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
As you know, next week

151
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
Excuse me for a second

152
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Next week

153
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,120
On was it, I think Tuesday the 28th

154
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Going to court in Amsterdam

155
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Against this gossip magazine

156
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Who did two things wrong in my mind

157
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
One is they followed my daughter

158
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Took pictures

159
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
I'm sorry

160
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
They didn't publish pictures

161
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
They followed my daughter

162
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
And they published

163
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
The name of her school

164
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
And how she is transported

165
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Or was I might say

166
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Two in from school

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Which of course in my mind

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Is definitely in danger of my child

169
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Now that of course is going to be subject

170
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,120
To a judge saying, well, you know, you've had her in the public eye

171
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
And maybe, you know, maybe it's okay for 15 year olds

172
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,120
To be followed around by men with large lenses

173
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Which I don't think so

174
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
So that's very subjective

175
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
That that'll just depend upon the judge

176
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Remember no jury system in the Netherlands

177
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
It's a professional judge system

178
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
And if they run out of judges

179
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Then they revert back to a pool of backup judges

180
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Who of course are lawyers

181
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,120
In their during their day job

182
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
So it's a kind of interesting court situation

183
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Not at all likely might be used to in the states

184
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
And here's the interesting thing

185
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Because I just saw they had to produce all the documents

186
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
They're going to enter into the lawsuit

187
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Whatever

188
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
And what they're claiming

189
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
This is great

190
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
They're claiming that the

191
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
For those of you who don't know what happened here

192
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,120
They took pictures off of my flicker site

193
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Which of all every single picture I put up has a creative comment

194
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Either it's public or private

195
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,120
And of course I do have some pictures that are private

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Just because I store all my pictures on flicker

197
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
But I don't want everything to be seen

198
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,120
And every single picture has a creative comments

199
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
License attached to it

200
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Which is the share like non-commercial attribution

201
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Which means, well, go look it up

202
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
It's creative comments

203
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
It's real simple

204
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,120
But you understand the point about non-commercial

205
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
So you can't use these pictures for commercial purposes

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
And of course a gossip magazine

207
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Unless they're truly going to claim that it's news

208
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
That would be interesting

209
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
But I don't think that's the direction they're taking

210
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,120
So they basically stole my pictures

211
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
And published them across three pages

212
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
I mean, I'm not talking like little snapshot

213
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I mean, I'm talking like full page stuff

214
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
For my trip to San Francisco

215
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
The three of us in Central Park

216
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Just it was our personal pictures

217
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Which if I ever wanted to sell those

218
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Believe me, I could actually make some real money

219
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
From selling those for publication

220
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
So here's the argument

221
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Underneath each picture or next to each picture on flicker

222
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,120
It'll say if the picture is privateer public

223
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
And then it has a little creative comments logo

224
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Which is typified by the circle

225
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,120
With two seas inside of it

226
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,120
What they're saying, this is their argument

227
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Is that the words this photo is public

228
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Means that that photo is public

229
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,120
And you can go and take that photo and do with it as you wish

230
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I can't believe they're actually going to enter this as their defense

231
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
But apparently they are

232
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
This is exactly what they're saying

233
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
And like well, you know

234
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
It just boggles the mind

235
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
And if this could actually happen

236
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Because if they could get away with this

237
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Because of those words this photo is public

238
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Then Yahoo has a lot of explaining to do

239
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Because Yahoo owns flicker

240
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
And man they got a lot of changes to make

241
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
And it just doesn't seem like that is possible

242
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
I think these guys are just trying to wheeze around

243
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Someone didn't really look

244
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
And the arrogance of it

245
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
I just can't believe the arrogance of it

246
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,120
You know if I'm caught file sharing

247
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,120
One fucking MP3 of a ripped off song

248
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,120
You know then I get a call from the settlement agency

249
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
From the RIA

250
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,120
And only although probably started around 50,000

251
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
In my case probably more

252
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
But they can would let down to about five

253
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
And that's what I'd have to pay

254
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,120
If I didn't want to get my ass sued off

255
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
And these guys just come on to the net

256
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Just come into any place they want

257
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Take a picture and just pop not just one

258
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Three they just publish them full page

259
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
It's unbelievable

260
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,120
So that of course boggles my mind

261
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I had to spend a couple minutes just

262
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Replying to my attorneys

263
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Three me through email I'll call them later

264
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,120
But I'm sure that they have the same opinion about that

265
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
It's just nuts

266
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Let's see, yesterday great day in the office

267
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Here at Pod Show and at the headquarters

268
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Dawn and Drew were in town

269
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
So there's a lot of a lot of hub up

270
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
We had a lunch forum which is great

271
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Because everyone is working so incredibly hard

272
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,120
I think around the fifth or seventh of March I think

273
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
Maybe something like that is we're going to start

274
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Bringing listeners

275
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,120
And we'll probably do a very small beta for listeners

276
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
To come into the into Pod Show

277
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Plus and check out some of the stuff that we've been building

278
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
So everyone's really really working very hard

279
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
It was nice to just get get out

280
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I'll have a lunch

281
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
For some reason we serve Margaritas at this lunch

282
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Which I thought was fascinating

283
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
I had one I was like

284
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Okay, I think that's it

285
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,120
But it was great to see Dawn and Drew

286
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,120
And I wish I could have gone to the podcaster meet-up last night

287
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
I was really planning on it

288
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
But I got kind of hung up at the office

289
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Working on some stuff with K2

290
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
And before you know it's like nine o'clock

291
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
And so I forget about it

292
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Let's see a couple of pieces of feedback

293
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I want to share with you today as well

294
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Here's one from a buddy of ours

295
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
I'm just Kevin Reeves

296
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm not even going to try and apologize for the

297
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Weird audio quality here

298
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm laying in bed

299
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
It's 6 a.m

300
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
And I'm checking my email

301
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,120
And I'm completely pissed off about something

302
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,120
And DSC 139

303
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
You were talking about

304
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,120
People in Australia not being able to purchase

305
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,120
The song from the PMN

306
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Because of some credit card issue

307
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,120
I wake up this morning and I got an email

308
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,120
From another Australian listener

309
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Who cannot purchase my album

310
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,120
My website with the little PayPal buttons that I've put up there

311
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,120
The credit card itself is being denied

312
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Not an insufficient funds kind of denied

313
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
But you can't use this credit card denied

314
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,120
And I've heard about this

315
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
A ton of times on the Maccast

316
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
I've heard about it

317
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
A lot of times just kind of

318
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Surfing around the podosphere and the net

319
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
That people in Australia

320
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
For some reason

321
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Can't seem to get music

322
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Now my site is a dumbass PayPal button

323
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,120
That is generated just from the, you know, merchant tools thing

324
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,120
It just says click, you know,

325
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,120
PayPal, fast free and secure or whatever

326
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
So what is up with our

327
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Supposed global infrastructure

328
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Not being able to support our friends down under

329
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,120
I'm just completely pissed off with the fact that

330
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,120
You know, somebody had a desire to buy some of my music

331
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
It's nine bucks

332
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
I don't give a shit about the money

333
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,120
That's not the issue that I'm trying to raise here

334
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
But if somebody liked my music

335
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Wanted to support me as an artist

336
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Wanted to wanted the music

337
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
And can't get to it

338
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Because somehow they're locked out

339
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Because of their region

340
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,120
That is just completely ass of mine

341
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
We live in this global market

342
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
And here we are

343
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,120
People can't buy something

344
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
From a website

345
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Just because they live somewhere else

346
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,120
This is completely retarded

347
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,120
And I'm sure that there's more

348
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Incidences than you can count with PayPal

349
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
And iTunes

350
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,120
And whatever else that takes a credit card that's saying

351
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Oh, you can't purchase this

352
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Because you're from, the fuck kind of world do we live in here

353
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm just completely I rate

354
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,120
So if anybody in Australia wants to buy my record

355
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Preorder it whatever

356
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Fuck it

357
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Send me a receipt that says you can't get it

358
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,120
And I will send you a free download

359
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,120
That's just how we're going to do it

360
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,120
I feel like people should have access to my music

361
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
And if you can't get it

362
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
I will make sure you get it

363
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
So that's it for today

364
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Adam, I just thought I would throw that out there

365
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
I'm sorry for the long feedback

366
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,120
But I just wanted to open dialogue

367
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
No, I got it

368
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
I totally get it, you're pissed

369
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Of course you are

370
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
And so now I have some backup here

371
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
On some of the problems we saw

372
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Some folks from Australia trying to purchase

373
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Podsafe or piece off of the Podsafe music network

374
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,120
And they were having trouble with their credit card

375
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,120
So I guess it's not just

376
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
It's just in general for some reason

377
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
The clearing houses or the credit card

378
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Processing companies

379
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I don't know what it is

380
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
But that is major discrimination

381
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
And why?

382
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
And let me, I'm just trying to think back

383
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Because I talked to Chris Rockwell about it

384
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I know we saw a purchase from New Zealand

385
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
I think we had at least one or two purchases from Australia

386
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,120
But we have gotten feedback that some folks have had problems

387
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Using their credit card

388
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,120
So it does seem like some kind of discrimination

389
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
I guess

390
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Moving forward

391
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
With the unlabeled concept

392
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Making MP3s available

393
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Free and clear for you to purchase

394
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Through the Podsafe music network

395
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
I think we're going to add a couple more songs to the data test

396
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
So we can really

397
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
We want to test out the podcaster links

398
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
There's all kinds of reporting

399
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Stuff remember now if you're participating in the data test

400
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
You'll see that

401
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Just every single track on the Podsafe music network

402
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Has a kind of grayed out by button

403
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Which means you can't buy it yet

404
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
But if you look for podsafe

405
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
For peace you can actually sign up and see the process

406
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
And send us some feedback on that

407
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
If you will please and for night

408
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
You know put your credit card in you've opened an account

409
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
And of course

410
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Except for the transaction fee which is nine cents

411
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Everything else is going to podsafe

412
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
For peace which of course is going directly to unice

413
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
So for the data test

414
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
No one's making money

415
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
It's up the damn credit card guys

416
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
In this case that would be clicking by

417
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
But hey, you know what they're doing it

418
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
And then yeah, okay

419
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
So we're just going to continue to test that

420
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
And I think that we'll have a couple more songs that will make available

421
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
And then we'll just open it up

422
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
So any artists can go in

423
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Click a button and make any tracks available

424
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
That they wish

425
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
What else was I gonna say

426
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
My goodness

427
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Oh you know who's in town today

428
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Ponsi

429
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
If you don't know Ponsi she is a Chris Parillo's better half

430
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Then I really mean the better half

431
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
She's going to be in San Francisco

432
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
You know nom dex is coming up

433
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,120
So maybe maybe I can drag her on the podcast

434
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
That would be cool

435
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Yeah, maybe we do that for tomorrow

436
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
We'll do a thank god it's Friday with Ponsi that could be yeah that could be interesting

437
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
All right, so I'll ask her if she'll do that

438
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
So she's going to be in the office

439
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
And around San Francisco that'll be fun

440
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
Oh man oh yesterday

441
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
We had we finally had our earth link conversation

442
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
You know what I want to talk about the earth link conversation

443
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
But I'm going to do that outside of the satellite window

444
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,120
So folks on the serious stars 103

445
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120

Six foot five

265 pounds of angry ex-loinbacker

450
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,120
His daddy toughened him up with a strap

451
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,120
The law called it child abuse and assault

452
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
His daddy called it discipline

453
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
That discipline

454
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Help make Perry Dawsey

455
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh pilot wrecking ball of a linebacker

456
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,120
A football legend and a pain-dealing machine

457
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
What would the football stop

458
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,120
The violence didn't Perry has spent his whole life

459
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Trying to break the cycle of violence

460
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Do we come a better man than his father

461
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,120
He told himself to control his anger

462
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
His paranoia and his powerful rage

463
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,120
But the voices are telling him something else

464
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,120
When the infection hits Perry has only one week to live

465
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
The question is

466
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
How many people is he taking

467
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120

If the cure doesn't kill you

475
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120

So it drops March 11th

481
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
You know the success of Earth Corps

482
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Scott has got so many items in the fire

483
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
There's so much cool stuff going on

484
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
And I'm really looking forward to this new novel

485

Which of course will be released

486
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120

So stay tuned for that

488
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Let me see

489
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Okay, what we're going to do here

490
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
You know it seems like this infections

491
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Of course infectious infection

492
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
Flues

493
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
We talked about the bird flu yesterday on the podcast

494
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Oh of course

495
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
You think that I would be the only one talking about bird flu in podcast

496
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
No, I don't think so

497
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
The world of the 21st century

498
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,120
The planet is in a state of terror

499
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Helped to rent some by international terrorist groups

500
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Abel to trust constants on their own

501
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Unstoppable by the government

502
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Unreasonable to impress

503
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
So hard core a speaking sheep's and whistles

504
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
With a weapon so strong

505
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
So powerful

506
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
They can demand all the stealing grain they want

507
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Tweety pie stars in

508
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Bird flu

509
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Over the coos nest

510
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
The sea geek

511
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Until there's a cure to bird flu

512
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
There's something to listen to

513
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Double WWE dot

514
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
And the sneaky key dot next

515
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Go ahead take advantage of it

516
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Well yeah, and there's also a

517
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
There's a bird flu

518
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Uh weblog that I've been

Something completely different which I think will be

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
The blue collar comedy channel on 103

527
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Okay, they're gone

Speak in of Madge Weinstein

551
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Hello Adam

552
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
It's Madge here

553
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Listen I heard that you listen to your

554
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Asking why I haven't been

555
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
I'm

556
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Leaving new messages anymore

557
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Clever messages

558
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Well because evidently you found Roger Smalls

559
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Who you like more than me

560
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
And

561
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Plus my girlfriend because he is good

562
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
It's just died of cancer in case you didn't notice

563
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
First of all

564
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I am not the least bit offended by somebody

565
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Making a joke about cancer

566
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
That's idiotic

567
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Why the fuck would I make care about

568
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
Somebody making a joke about cancer

569
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
As if it just started to exist

570
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
When my gutsy isco

571
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
It's got cancer inside of it

572
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Listen remember a long time ago

573
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,120
When I said that I think breast cancer is worse

574
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I'm sorry when I thought vaginal yeast

575
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
It's worse than breast cancer

576
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Well listen

577
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
I meant it

578
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Because my gutsy

579
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Really Christ I got up

580
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
It just stayed hard

581
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
It's anyway enough

582
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
So I don't know what are all you walking on egg shells

583
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Plus I didn't even have time to listen to your gut

584
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Fuck I'm starving so now

585
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Listen that's not the real reason I'm complaining

586
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
And you better listen to this Adam

587
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Because you may not want to play it on your show

588
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
But how come

589
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
You want it bitchy you're going to get bitchy

590
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Why Adam

591
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Does it take since September

592
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
To get way into wisdom

593
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
And rate it fox

594
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Signed up with advertising agreements with pod show

595
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,120
I've had a call Brian longest a hundred thousand times

596
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
And nothing happens

597
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
And I called Richard Bruhae and he promised

598
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
Everything's going to work

599
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
And then he tells me no it's not going to work

600
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Because they're rearranging something

601
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
So that was some from September

602
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
To now now how the fuck am I supposed to make you got

603
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Damn money and me got damn money

604
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
If I can't even forget any of this

605
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Fucking fucking goddamn fucking paperwork

606
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
So get the shit together over there

607
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Already I don't know who's fucking fault it is

608
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
But just fucking take care of it

609
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
I'm doing my part

610
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
I call every five seconds and you're like

611
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Mads take initiative take initiative

612
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Well I'm taking goddamn initiative

613
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
I got a popular show that I work with Wanda

614
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
And Reagan with it's called Eat This Hot Show

615
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
It's been on it

616
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
It's actually featured on the iTunes

617
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,120
And how the fuck am I going to put sponsorship on it

618
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Take your goddamn assholes together

619
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
So do it

620
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
I'm in mourning

621
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Take care of me

622
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Mads my dear

623
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Well I went to the I went to the mat for you yesterday

624
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
To figure it all out

625
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
You remember when we helped you

626
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Set up your own production company

627
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Which owns your own podcasts

628
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Remember that dear match

629
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Remember when we did that and why did we do that

630
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
So that you could produce more shows

631
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Well

632
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Remember all the paperwork that had to be made up

633
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Which we paid for by the way

634
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
So that we could set up your production company

635
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Well now we have on our dime

636
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,120
We've gotten more lawyers more of my favorite people

637
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Mads working on agreements

638
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,120
So you can actually have the direct agreement

639
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
With Wanda and with Reagan

640
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
So give me a break

641
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Okay

642
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
I love you anyway baby

643
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
You know that

644
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Hello Adam this is Chris Skinner

645
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
From the podcast

646
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Simulacrum

647
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
It was a pleasure to hear you playing my advert

648
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
I think it was yesterday

649
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
For McWilco turbo sword 94

650
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Which is a brand that I'm sure will be available very soon

651
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
You had problems with the name

652
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Simulacrum

653
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
It basically means a vague

654
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Or unreal resemblance to something

655
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,120
And the shows called that because I interview very very very famous people

656
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
But they're not real

657
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Well they are real but they're not really there

658
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
But they kind of are

659
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
I think I think I'll probably be the best way to celebrate

660
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
And I have adverts on it as well

661
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Which are kind of real

662
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
But because they're really adverts

663
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
But they're not always

664
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Selling things that are there

665
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
And that are real

666
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
You should listen

667
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
It's really good and we should have you on

668
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Because you're your real really famous now

669
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
And you have a nice neck tie

670
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
So thank you very much

671
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Chris Skinner from Simulacrum

672
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
I keep up the good work

673
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Dude

674
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
What are you talking about?

675
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Maybe you're confused with Tim Curry

676
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
Who know is not related to me

677
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Let me point that out

678
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Speaking of being on shows

679
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I'd like to be on Simulacrum

680
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Now that I know how to pronounce it

681
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,120
If you haven't heard it today in podcasting

682
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Episode number

683
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Was it three or four I think

684
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Yeah, I'm not sure

685
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
I thought it was three

686
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Interviewed by the guys from today in podcasting

687
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Who build themselves kind of as a

688
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
A twit for podcasting

689
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Love it

690
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
We had a really nice conversation

691
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Haven't listened back to the show

692
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
But I know they posted it

693
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
And we had a really good chat

694
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
About just all kinds of stuff

695
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
And podcasting

696
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
And really enjoyable

697
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
So if you want to check that out

698
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
You can look for it

699
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
It's at today in podcasting.com

700
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I'm sure it is

701
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I'm sure this guy did that

702
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Okay, so briefly about earthling

703
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Because this is

704
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
First of all

705
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
I wish that I had recorded this

706
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
But you know when you have a phone call

707
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
It was me, Ron, KJ from the office

708
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,120
We had the folks at Jess and her team at MediaVest

709
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Who are their agency

710
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
And we had the marketing department in Atlanta

711
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
From earthling on the phone

712
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
And you know

713
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
If we'd all known each other really well before

714
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
And it would have said can I please record this

715
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
But actually

716
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
One or more I think Scott from earthling

717
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
I said that he would be happy to come on the show

718
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
And talk about

719
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
About our conversation

720
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Because he said it so eloquently

721
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
And so beautifully

722
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
You know what they had learned

723
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
From the earthling commercials

724
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
And all the feedback that they received

725
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Not only from us

726
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
But these guys are out there

727
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
They live on the internet

728
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,120
And they really do care about their customers

729
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
And they even said that they were laughing

730
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
At times about

731
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
You know about

732
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Basically the

733
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
The thought process that we'd all gone through

734
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
About these commercials

735
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
And I think that I'm also realizing now

736
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
That it just doesn't make sense

737
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
At least to have the same commercial

738
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,120
Playing every single time

739
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,120
And

740
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
And it was it was it was it said

741
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
You know we really liked a lot of these alternative

742
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Commercials

743
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
You know what was the one they said

744
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
From I think it was was that

745
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Derek Kay Miller who sent that one in

746
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
How shoot now I'm forgetting

747
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
The one that said you know earthling

748
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
It's like a laxative for your inbox

749
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
And it was so great he said

750
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
You know it's true that we really are

751
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
We really are laxative for your inbox

752
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
And we really like that kind of stuff

753
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
So we were coming up with a plan

754
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
That will involve everybody

755
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
And there is reward for this

756
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
There's obviously

757
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
You know I talk about a lot

758
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Social and for winners

759
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Yes economic reward

760
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
To participate in this

761
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
And we should be announcing

762
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
I hope sometime next week

763
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
We have sign off on the idea

764
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
And everything

765
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120
We've kind of talked a hint a little bit about

766
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
What that would be

767
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
But it was so nice to hear

768
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Talking about

769
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
New ways of advertising

770
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
And they're so into it

771
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
They are so completely into trying it

772
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
They understand it's a risk

773
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
But they said screw it

774
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
We just want to do this

775
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
Let's go and figure this out

776
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
So I'm looking

777
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
I'm looking forward to a lot of you

778
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
Folks helping us out

779
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
And indeed figuring out what works

780
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
What doesn't work

781
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
And you know maybe we'll learn something

782
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
In the process

783
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
I sure hope so

784
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
So anyway

785
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
I should be able to get Scott from earthling

786
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
I'll shoot for that next week

787
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
If I can get him on

788
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
To talk about their thoughts about advertising

789
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
In

790
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
You know really

791
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
When I think about it

792
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
I haven't seen or heard

793
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Many interviews with advertisers

794
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
With big name brands

795
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
I'm not talking about agencies

796
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
I'm talking about big name brands

797
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,120
And their thoughts about advertising

798
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
In podcasting

799
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
So that may be a first

800
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Certainly

801
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
I know that these guys are

802
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
We'll do a good job

803
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
But explaining their position

804
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
And what we're going to do

805
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
And I'm very excited about it

806
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Okay

807
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
I'll tell you what

808
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
I'm going to get ready

809
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
You know I've been standing here

810
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Once again in my

811
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
In my white bathrobe

812
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
With my black ugly boots on

813
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Which is the way we do it here in podcasts

814
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Alright Michael Butler

815
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
This one's for you

816
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
I think you love this song so much

817
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
But you got to do it

818
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
You don't like this

819
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
But you got to do it

820
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
You got to do it

821
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
You got to do it

822
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
You got to do it

823
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
One, four, three

824
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Stingray

825
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Right around

826
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
All our world down here

827
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
Been alive

828
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
Falling down on a patio

829
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
Making plans

830
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
Moaning to care

831
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
People go

832
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Can't happy face

833
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,120
It's sad I don't need you again

834
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Piles

835
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,120
No, one, four, three

836
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
That's where we're

837
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Get it all

838
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Now you'll never find it

839
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
You can feel it

840
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
One that's far

841
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
It's far

842
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
You'll never find it

843
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
One time

844
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
One from the corner

845
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,120
We've been by our time

846
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Take our right and right

847
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
But we got nothing to hide

848
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
Make a start

849
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Just one right

850
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,120
To our right

851
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Never say that

852
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Good boy

853
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,120
With your heart

854
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
What do I do

855
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
What do I do

856
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
What do I do

857
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,120
What do I do

858
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
You got to do it

859
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
One, four, three

860
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
That's where we're

861
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Get it all

862
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Now you'll never find it

863
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
You can feel it

864
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
One that's far

865
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
It's far

866
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
You'll never find it

867
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,120
You got to do it

868
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
There's all that brought us

869
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Ask a place

870
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
What do I do

871
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
What do I do

872
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
What do I do

873
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
What do I do

874
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,120
W Trying to find you

875
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,120
When I find you

876
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Everybody want me to spell it

877
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,120
When all I need is sudden

878
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:08,000
To begin one

879
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,620
And one is falling for you

880
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:31,020
One, four, three, from the Bodhisattva Music Network, music.bodshow.com.

881
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,580
I just realized I made an incredibly huge mistake.

882
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:44,220
Last Blaster Mike has created a new version, or the Beta 060 of Cast Blaster, find it at

883
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,620
castblaster.com, has removed the war bowl that everyone has been talking about.

884
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,980
And I'm such a dick.

885
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,900
I forgot to install it.

886
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,460
So apologies for the war bowl.

887
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,900
The minute I'm done with this show, I will go and install the new version.

888
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,060
I'm so sorry about that.

889
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,980
Adam at curry.com, dailysourcecode.com is where you can find all the information about

890
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
this show.

891
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,860
Be back if you feel like it tomorrow, right here on the Charley, it will be the thank

892
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
Goddots Friday edition.

Take care now.
