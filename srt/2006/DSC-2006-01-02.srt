00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Introducing Adam Curry, here down to his butt crack and layer of field that just don't wash off.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm towed three, four, five, six.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Sweetheart, thank you, thank you.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
With a $14 bicycle strap to his ass and a Yahoo Map of Gilbert England is front pocket.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He likes to think of himself as peddling into the future.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Adam Curry helped us Sierra Charlie 307 happy new year, everybody.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So it's an elemental, an innocent girl to get all right.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because now we can't receive so much attention to what it exists.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We have a horn and a side horn and side side.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We'll make him a fish shake.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm afraid that the fish will be killed.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Leave us as dead as a kiddo.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And the fish don't seek you a kill.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And the chips you want are the other.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And the world knows the rules.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Every time they release the wheels.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And jealous like you can't make you spend it to me.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A list you never meant to contest for free.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It turns into a sad, annoying sight of times from the hands.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But God never match your plans in my plans.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And jealous like you can't make you spend it to me.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And jealous like you can't make you spend it to me.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And I'm walking through outside the sunset clouds.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And I'm walking through inside the sunset clouds.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Yeah, now that's the way to start the new year.

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,920
Negative tones for Brooklyn, so my troubles begin on safe music network.

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
I'm so 307.

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,880
How did the daily source code starting off a new year?

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,920
2006, we did it.

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,200
We made it all the way through.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,600
I hope you had a great new year, I hope you had a great celebration, and hope you are

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,000
ready and pumped for some cool stuff coming up this year.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,400
Whew, oh my goodness, thanks Camille AC for pointing out the negative tone track to me.

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Actually, I heard that on the Ultimate Mix podcast.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,800
I was like, what, does something about that song?

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm not really a guy who plays a lot of indie rock or punk rock, but it was almost

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,400
like, there was a piece taken from the Beatles, the, the, the, the, the, the mixed in with,

64
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,400
it almost sounded like hello from YouTube, I don't know, just the, it kind of worked

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
for me.

66
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Learned a lot of things over the, over the, the passing of the past year and the entrance

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,800
of the new year, all kinds of lists showed up everywhere, and all kinds of information,

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,200
and the hundred things you found out this year.

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,400
That's actually something that I found in, let's see, who sent this to me?

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,800
It was, uh, Steve Page sent me this link to the BBC website.

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
I think what it was, it's exactly a title of this.

72
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
I think it's a hundred things.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,000
We didn't know this time last year.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,800
So this was published on Friday the 30th and at number 100, I think it's number 100.

75
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
And this is something I didn't know.

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Um, it turns out, and I quote from this article, musical instrument shops.

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,000
So that's places where you buy guitars and drums and stuff like that.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Must pay an annual royalty to cover shoppers who perform a recognizable riff before they

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
buy.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,200
Considering a public performance.

81
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
So I guess that's true in the, in the UK.

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,200
I don't know.

83
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Is that true in the US?

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,800
I assure there's lots of people who work at, uh, at music shops who listen to,

85
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I actually I probably should ask big, big mic, he go figure find out for me.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,200
But I was blown away by that.

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,600
Of course, it makes sense.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
You're playing music.

89
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,800
We've, and I told Patricia this and it's been an ongoing discussion throughout the new

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,400
years.

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,600
She said, but I don't understand why the, well, that's bullshit.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
I said, well, when, you know, because she's a, um, uh, uh,

93
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,600
be my stem rower slash asscat BMI artist.

94
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,200
And, um, and she gets she collects royalties from public performances.

95
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
And I went down the list.

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,600
Well, if someone plays your music in an elevator, yeah, I want to get paid.

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Well, if someone plays your music on the radio, yeah, I want to get played.

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,200
If someone plays your music on a podcast.

99
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,400
And then she's like, well, yeah, yeah, I guess so.

100
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,200
I said, well, how much?

101
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
So I basically what it boils down to every single time.

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,400
As I keep saying, look, you know, these are the problems.

103
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
And we've just stopped bothering with them.

104
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,000
There's plenty of talent, plenty of great music out there.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
Yeah, it's a fuck.

106
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,800
It's a major bummer that I can't play because what we're listening to today.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Stevie Wonder story, um, and the BBC has a wonderful, um, musical journey

108
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
through Stevie's life and, um, and an interview with Stevie Wonder.

109
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, I'd love to have that on a podcast, but obviously we can't do that.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,400
So she said, yeah, but so that'll never happen again.

111
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,800
How about Glenn Miller said, nope, can't play that either.

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I just went going on a list and look, you know, representatives from your community

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,200
need to step up and say, this is messed up and we need to come up with something else.

114
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,600
But in the meantime, we're not stopping.

115
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
We're just continuing with what we're doing.

116
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,800
And, um, she bought Kumar.

117
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I think I pronounced in that right.

118
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Sent me a link to, um, see, what site is this?

119
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
This was pretty funny.

120
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,200
This is, um, it's a website, but it's basically a publication for, um,

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,200
for the radio broadcast industry, radio daily news.com named Steve Jobs,

122
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
radio person of the year.

123
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
For his innovation and podcasting.

124
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,000
Let me see if I can read from the press release.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,800
He was pretty funny.

126
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,600
Oh, there was a specific mention of, of podcasting in here.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,400
Oh, yeah, Steve Jobs has been a champion innovator and producer of technological

128
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
products, absolutely true.

129
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,400
His Apple II, my iPad, I put shuffle blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,400
The introduction of the iPod changed the way that people listen to music

131
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,600
and other audio and video programming iPod spawn podcast and almost overnight.

132
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,200
A new distribution channel for radio entertainment program for radio program was born

133
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,800
with the introduction of replays of sports news information entertainment program content.

134
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
That's right.

135
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,200
It continues to grow measureably with more innovations expected to be introduced by

136
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,000
Steve Jobs and Apple in 2006, absolutely fantastic.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
My goodness.

138
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Hey, and of course, this says the first show the new year on a serious stars one

139
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,600
of three, the lineup is back and everyone's cracking and rearing to go.

140
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm told.

141
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,200
So for the first half hour of this podcast, we'll be simultaneously cast on

142
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
the serious satellite radio network.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And I guess it's only what seven more days until Howard Stern arrives.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hey, you have to think about, by the way, so the goal here is to show you the stars,

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
so you'll think about what I'm going to do.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,200
Hey, Adam, this is Tokyo Dan hitting the hot clubs and recording the hot indie bands

147

We are a flank.

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,400
You know, I got Patricia that karaoke microphone for Christmas, so I'm totally enthralled

184
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,560
by the capabilities and possibilities and that was actually it was more like a commercial

185
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,440
than a promo, but it kind of worked both ways, which is why I played it for you.

186
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,640
Quite a community, this karaoke stuff is Peter Jacobs lives in Germany, and he sent me

187
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,040
an email titled the Senseo Conspiracy, and he's come up with something that even had

188
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
caught my attention.

189
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,080
Not just for those of you who knew to the show just tuning in for the first time, maybe

190
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,800
maybe you got an iPod for Christmas and you hooked it up and like, oh, what's this podcast

191
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
thing?

192
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,240
I love the Senseo Coffee machine made by Philips and Dawa Echiberts.

193
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I love it.

194
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I love the product.

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,560
I love the coffee, and then I figured out how to make it just right.

196
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,240
It gives me gastronomitis, and I love to talk about the Senseo whenever I do burp.

197
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,080
But now, PJ from Germany says, I've been listening to your show for a few weeks now.

198
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,080
There's something that keeps bugging me about it, while you seem to struggle from freedom

199
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,400
from the music industry.

200
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,560
You keep advertising the Senseo brand, as someone who really likes coffee and really dislikes

201
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,440
the way the world is shaped by global players.

202
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,800
This is a constant thorn in my ears.

203
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Here's why.

204
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Senseo is a brand of Sarah Lee, which I don't think is true.

205
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,280
I don't, I think it's, well, I could be wrong, but I thought it was Philips, and maybe

206
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
they sold it.

207
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,160
Anyway, just as Nestle has Nest Spresso, and craft foods has Tassimo, those brands

208
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
are closed.

209
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,800
Non-interoperable formats, that was a great.

210
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,520
We're getting down into, and today, wine a land of coffee.

211
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,080
Just as if Sony was to create a media device that was sold for very cheap money, but

212
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,400
could only play content from Sony or their licensees.

213
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,040
Well indeed, such a device exists.

214
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
It's the Sony PlayStation portable.

215
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Here's how it works.

216
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,000
The brand owner sells licenses to the companies who produce the coffee makers, while they

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,960
may actually not sell licenses, they may sponsor them for every machine sold.

218
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,560
This way, cheap, system-bound coffee makers are pushed in the market.

219
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,280
Yeah, kind of like razor blades, I guess, which is also an uninteroperable format.

220
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,800
The brand owners may sell licenses for the supplies, like coffee tablets, where they may

221
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,760
choose to keep them monopoly on it, just like with inkjet printer cartridges.

222
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
So if you've got one of the cheap machines, this effectively gets you on the hook of a global

223
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,200
player, such as those named above.

224
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,280
Not only can they dictate what you pay for your coffee, and the system coffee is as much

225
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,600
as three times expensive as normal coffee, they can also push competitors out of the

226
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
market.

227
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,440
Podcasting is closely linked to freedom, since sale and the likes are linked to closed markets

228
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,560
and control, and if you like the stuff fine, but don't advertise it.

229
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
It's bad.

230
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,960
When I presume he means by that they're evil.

231
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Dude, it's coffee.

232
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,600
It's fucking coffee, okay?

233
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:10,560
Hello Adam, this is Robin, that's Robin from InsightWorks.com, that's INS-YT-W-O-R-K-S.com.

234
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,640
I want to give you my thoughts on advertising and the possibilities with podcasting.

235
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,120
I think it's all about relationships.

236
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:25,240
Right now, relationships between the buyer and the seller with the intermediary of the advertisers.

237
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,200
There's not much of a relationship other than cash on an individual basis.

238
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,440
We send out an advertisement either over the radio, over TV, trying to induce the buyer to then

239
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,560
make an individual relationship with the seller.

240
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,960
They'll go to whatever source and then buy the product.

241
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,160
We have the capability of building great relationships through podcasting.

242
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,400
If we can aggregate those buyers through the websites, through the show notes, and create

243
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:57,160
huge numbers of buyers, slash listeners, the marketing folks, the advertising folks are absolutely

244
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,560
going to want to listen.

245
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,280
Let's use a Senseo machine for example, Senseo right now sells on Amazon for roughly $50 a

246
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
unit.

247
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,560
If you were to have a capability of aggregating all the listeners or the buyers that might

248
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,120
be interested in buying Senseo machines and say, hey, here's a sliding scale.

249
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:23,640
If you're not in a rush, sign up to buy a Senseo at either $25 a unit, $30, $35, $40, $45, $50.

250
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,760
All those listeners can then go click on whatever choice they want.

251
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:34,080
So, yep, I will commit to buy a Senseo machine over the next two months at $35 a unit.

252
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,520
Everybody picks their own price range.

253
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,600
By aggregating all those people together, then pot show could go to the Senseo manufacturer.

254
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,880
We have $10,000 people that are willing to buy Senseo at $25 a unit, or we have an additional

255
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:56,920
$8,000 to buy at $35 a unit, or we have $2,000 that are willing to do it at $40,000,

256
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,120
and we have three people willing to do it at $49.

257
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,920
If you can take those kind of numbers, go to the Senseo manufacturer.

258
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,840
I think they would fall over themselves to sell 10 or 20,000 units, even though it's

259
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,640
below their retail price.

260
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,280
It's about the relationship between the pot caster and the listener, and the listeners

261
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
are the buyers.

262
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,000
I pull in them all together, you can get some big numbers that will have a lot of power.

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,280
Love to hear your thoughts on this.

264
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,600
Mr. Robin at InsightWorks.com, that's IMSYTWORKS.com.

265
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Thanks, Rob.

266
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Thanks, Rob.

267
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Thanks so long, Adam.

268
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Hey, Owens.

269
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Tailwinds.

270
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Back at your buddy.

271
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Okay, so that was very complicated.

272
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:47,680
Founded a lot like some of those internet bubble companies that would use the power of aggregating

273
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,840
consumer demand.

274
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,040
Yeah, that works to a certain degree, actually it works very well to a certain degree,

275
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,080
but it's a whole business by itself, and just putting my pod caster hat on here for a second,

276
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,520
which I do all the time, boy, do we get into some heated arguments when I put the pod

277
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,760
caster on at the office?

278
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I don't want to any.

279
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
That's too complicated.

280
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,840
I like the idea of, excuse me, do I have to say it?

281
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:21,680
I like the idea of turning the tables around, and indeed, if we start acting like these

282
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,360
relationships that we have with our listeners, that they really are that special, and there

283
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,600
is something much bigger going on than just what you can achieve with spot advertising.

284
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,600
Then we have to covet it.

285
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Then we also have to stand up for it and say, look, we're going to only advertise

286
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,320
what we want to advertise, we're going to, and by the way, the numbers work out so nicely

287
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,160
in this, you know, what I was thinking about this a lot over the holiday, I think that

288
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,400
was really brought us all down when it comes to the traditional broadcasts that we see

289
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
now.

290
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Radio television, radio television predominantly, is that, you know, the only way for the, for the

291
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,960
media companies to make more money is to either a raise the prices on advertising, which

292
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:15,120
is, wow, you know, that's like, yeah, if, if they could, they would, but there's just,

293
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,800
you know, that's been hammered out, that's what these industries really drive on is that,

294
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:25,440
that price, you know, what are we paying for eyeballs or ear drums, they either, so

295
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,520
they can either raise the price or they can, they can broadcast more commercials, repetition

296
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,120
basically, and that is the fundamental difference between what we're doing in podcasts and

297
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,320
just an example, because it'll, it'll go to vlogging and all that other stuff is that we

298
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,440
have no limitation on time, you know, hey, you know, you just make more shows, more choice,

299
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,200
that's what, that's what I see, when I look at the directories, I said to myself, oh my God,

300
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,600
look at that, you know, tens of thousands of, of stations, something that's just not possible

301
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,240
in any radio market, any terrestrial, either based radio market, anywhere in the world, it's fantastic,

302
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,280
I love it. So we'll be talking a lot more about that special relationship between advertisers,

303
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,400
podcasters, and their audience, and how that's, how we're, yeah, we're going to try and make

304
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,720
it work this year, that will definitely be high on the mission statement for me. Quick update about

305
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,800
my parents, I spoke to my mom this morning, and I actually didn't get to speak to her,

306
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,640
New Year's Eve, because she went to bed early. So Friday, she starts with her chemo,

307
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,040
instead of the two to three sessions, they said, well, we'll start you off with six sessions,

308
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:47,040
so that was kind of a bummer, and I guess just, you know, keeping positivity up is the, is the best

309
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,960
we can do. I really, it sucks so fucking bad because, you know, it's, it's one thing when I'm here,

310
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,480
I can just pop across the channel and go help route or visit or whatever, but since I'm in San Francisco,

311
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
a lot too, that makes it a little more complicated. So I'm going to try and schedule stuff with my sister,

312
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,280
so that there will always be one of us around. And of course, she's got Bob, who's a fantastic,

313
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,840
you know, he's, he's really helping her sail through all this crap. And both my sisters went to visit

314
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,640
my dad in the hospital, it turns out that, oh, and I have to pronounce this properly, hold on a second,

315
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:27,760
who sent me this, I got an email about, from Neil, the acronym TIA, please, in the states,

316
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:38,880
we never call it a TIA, we call it a TIA, and I guess that Neil, what Neil, Neil is for 20 years,

317
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,240
has been ultrasound and vascular technologist and now a radiology computer nerd. Okay,

318
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,520
pronunciation correction accepted. So it's a TIA, actually it wasn't a TIA, it turned out it was

319
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,760
really just a small stroke. So he is still in the hospital and will be there probably for the

320
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,920
rest of this week and things not going too well on that front because he's lost 40% of his left,

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,120
the use of his left side. Oh my goodness. Hey, here at the cottage, we're all healthy, okay?

322
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:21,040
We're feeling good here. Say it with me now. Yodsey. Yep. I'm bringing it back. Yodsey.

323
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,720
There will be Yankee Alpha Delta Charlie, yet another drum cadence. We started off today with Zack

324
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,160
Winick. Adam sent you a request of drum cadences. Thought I'd tap into my archives. The first track

325
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,040
is a remix of a cadence from Valencia High School in Valencia, California home of six flags magic

326
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,080
mountain. It's done by a band called Lotus Fear. The band unfortunately no longer exists, but

327
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,560
he does have permission to hand off to me to play it. Sounds kind of fuzzy, but I'll risk it. Okay.

328
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,760
The name of the song is Rump Bump Bump.

329
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
All right, from the Valencia High School watching band.

330
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:50,560
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right

331
00:21:50,560 --> 00:22:20,560
All right, all right, all right,

332
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,960
something going on over there and feel free to send me your drum cadences for the

333
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,160
Yatsi yet another drum cadence. Oh, that means we need another jingle for that segment totally

334
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,920
into the jingles for segments these days. And I'd ask all of you to send me in suggestions from

335
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,280
the pop music network to play on the show and I'm getting a lot of them. Thank you very much

336
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,280
picking out the ones that, you know, so you like them and I listen to it if I like it,

337
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,920
then play it on the show. It's pretty simple. And I also talked about that I thought in 2006,

338
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,560
we'll, we'll definitely see music videos being created for songs from the potsafe music network.

339
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,160
Excuse me, CC Chapman from accident hash immediately contacted me as he does and pointed me to his

340
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,120
random food. Now I don't know if he, if it's cool to give out the link, so he'll have to put that

341
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,200
or let me know or put it on his show notes or whatever. And he's done a couple of videos for some

342
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,120
potsafe artists and they're really good. It's really, and I was like blown away. And then to hit

343
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,360
me that in order to create a music video, very much, you know, the way we've been putting together

344
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,920
stuff like potsafe or peas, the way the Christmas carol projects that were multiple podcasts,

345
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,960
Christmas carol stories, how they were put together, you really only need, well, first you need

346
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,840
the music, then you need and believe me, this is exactly how the MTV videos are conceptualized.

347
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,400
So you need someone to shoot the performance footage, because you need the band either.

348
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,080
You need to, usually, not all videos, but usually you have some kind of performance footage.

349
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,520
Then you have, we call the conceptual footage. You know, this is the, the Arty Farty shit that we

350
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,720
make around it or whether that's done with video editing or whether that's done with, with effects

351
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,280
or or with some other story line that that we've through. And then of course you need editing.

352
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,080
So you really need to find, if you have one of those skills to find two other people, and of

353
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,520
course, the willingness of the band, and then we can really turn out some great shit.

354
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,800
Oh, before I forget, people on the satellite listening to this show right now, the Daily

355
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,760
Source code, it's all part of pod shows line up. And next, we have Pacific Coast Hellway for you

356
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,080
followed by an hour of the Angry Jewish Lesbian Madge Weinstein. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

357
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,360
Thanks for listening. While we continue.

358
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:44,240
Right. So now the question is, do people care? I think they would care about about music videos.

359
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,000
I really enjoyed looking at the three that CC had up on his feed. And I think there's something

360
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,960
there. So I'm just opening up the Florida suggestions. Something else I found while I was

361
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,360
checking out the pod safe music network. Hey, Agent, just refresh a couple of times.

362
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Do they know the songs that show up have been played at least once? So there's some validity

363
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,160
to play it in. I scan them. And I really like what I heard on this one. It's from Sad Light,

364
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,880
from 2004. It's just another girl on D.S.C.

365
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,440
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No

366
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:29,360
No. No. No. No.

367
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:59,360
So, none? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

368
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,120
And then going along

369
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,440
The whole family came back

370
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,960
Putting aside my law

371
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,160
Time dies, time dies

372
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,240
Little and again restless

373
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,080
And now I see you, baby

374
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,520
Break the sign

375
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,720
They tell you why

376
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,280
Neither

377
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,700
Can't see

378
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,400
She's just another girl

379
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,860
Just another girl

380
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,680
She's another girl

381
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,320
That he's dead

382
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,900
Can't attract love

383
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,920
Can't elect ya

384
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,340
She's my girl

385
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,560
She can't get show

386
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,080
Can't to take love

387
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,060
Can't get enough viennent

388
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,600
Together just in all the way

389
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,920
So just in all the way

390
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,400
Just in all the way

391
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,040
So just in all the way

392
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,240
Together Just in all the way

393
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,800
From satellite just another girl from using.tomutiot.com

394
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,840
Just wrapping up a couple of things

395
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,880
Before we wind up the first show the new year something that I had missed something with my Gmail filters screwed it up

396
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,600
Adrian peg sent me a fantastic recording of Podsay for peace if every day could work Christmas

397
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,520
That was played on the BBC in the context of Podsay for music and there was some interview. I was really good

398
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,000
I was on I think radio five

399
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,760
So I just wanted to make mention of that and one of my new years resolutions

400
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,360
I don't have a lot of them because you know, and a new year's kind of came and went

401
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,640
You know, yeah, we celebrated but it was your weird home. We just quiet

402
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,960
Christina by the way went to her first new year's party. So we picked her up around 1-15

403
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,320
Oh boy, um, yeah, she had a great time by the way

404
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,920
It was you know a little frightening from mom and dad as you can imagine

405
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,200
One of my new years resolutions. I'm gonna get my audio book up and rolling now

406
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,280
This is not a story or actually it's a series of stories that I did not write myself

407
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,560
But I've enjoyed I enjoyed the stories immensely when I was a kid

408
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
And it turns out there in the public domain

409
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,400
And I found it on that the Gutenberg project and

410
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,080
I will be contributing to LibriVox which we talked about last year. Oh sounds good. Doesn't last year

411
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:49,600
Which is the open source audio book collection? I guess we'd call it and I'm so loving this because I actually have a downloaded a book

412
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,120
That I've been listening to and there is absolutely no difference between what these guys are doing and

413
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,320
What um

414
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,440
Audible is doing and I'm a a customer of audible

415
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,400
But sometimes you know and facts more often than not

416
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,680
I'll be pretty disappointed with the quality or with not just the audio quality

417
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,560
They've they seem to have gotten that pretty much you know on track now

418
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,560
But if it's not the audio quality then it's just the the general performance quality of the of the readers or

419
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
The speaker some of course are fantastic

420
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,160
But you know, I listen to this stuff that is done by quote amateurs and the only reason they're quote amateurs because they're not being paid for it

421
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:38,520
There's no difference in quality in fact some of it the quality is superior and so is the performance quality

422
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
And I think it's great and

423
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,280
You know to be able to to enjoy these stories and to be able to pass them on and I'm very excited about doing that

424
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,400
So I look soon I'll keep you up the speed but that is one of my resolutions

425
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,320
I just have to kind of you know take the time to do it because it does take time to and I want to figure out how to do it

426
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,560
And am I gonna do different voices am I going to do it all from you know

427
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,760
I just got to figure all that stuff out one of the resolutions though and

428
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,640
Speaking of liberal box I was very excited as you know

429
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,560
I'm excited about the whole idea, but I was even more excited when I received the following audio feedback. Hey Adam

430
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,040
This is Tom Maris. I have talked you before

431
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,720
I just thought I'd drop you an audio comment about what you said in the DSC

432
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
306

433
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
You were talking about liberal box and

434
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
So great service

435
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:37,960
Great thing I've been trying to start up a open source audio books kind of a service for years now and nobody's been interested

436
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
But finally somebody's done it and

437
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,520
It's worked so and I'm gonna record something for it, which is I'm gonna do it because I'm a

438
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,360
I'm a university student study philosophy and one of my specialisms is in nature

439
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,080
So I'm gonna do I'm probably gonna do one of the public domain translations of nature and and put that up

440
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,320
In English of course, but most of the amount public to manage is only two I think which are

441
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,240
One of them has already been done by the liberal box people

442
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,320
So that's pretty cool. I just thought I'd say you asked about getting stuff in OPML and

443
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,640
You asked you receive I put together an

444
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,800
OPML file

445
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I've heard about it

446
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,480
opened up my OPML editor

447
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,000
typed it up and

448
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,480
Before the show was even finished. I put it online

449
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,400
You can get it at host them to OPML.org slash Tom Maris slash Librevox dot OPML and

450
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
You can stick it in indie pot or you can

451
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,760
Subscribe to it whatever you want to do with it. I'll try and keep it up to date. I'm basing it on the RSS feed

452
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,320
So when the RSS feed is updated I'll update the OPML shortly afterwards

453
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,040
It may take a few hours to get around doing it, but it'll get done eventually

454
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Anyway, I love the show. I'm looking forward to

455
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,040
whole years filled with a daily source code entertainment and information and

456
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,000
All the other good stuff. I've come to expect from from the podfather himself

457
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:12,200
Cheers. Bye. Well, all right Tom. Thank you very much. Fantastic. I immediately copied and pasted the link put it into indie potter.org

458
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,280
Right there on the homepage. I don't control the audio books node

459
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,320
So I just plopped it underneath and said audio books from Librevox

460
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,760
I hopefully the noted editor of audio books will

461
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,160
We'll add the Librevox stuff and we'll add that link until then. I'll just keep this one on the homepage

462
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,160
It's kind of the way it works with these open source directories or distributed directories and

463
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:42,280
By the way, in the coming weeks because this week is going to be completing code and

464
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,760
The week of the ninth will be testing. We're going to open up the podsafe the pod

465
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,280
Forget about it. We're opening up goddamn it. We're opening up our doors

466
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,160
We're going to start slowly, but we're getting there and of course

467
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880

00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,720
Underneath that and then my black ogs. Oh, yeah, so stylish. Maybe I should go out of your view really quick
