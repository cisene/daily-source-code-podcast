1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Shere Charly 314

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We don't need no sticky drinks, dude

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Fantastic, it's a battle curry

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Coming to you from the condo

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The curry condo and northern California is a business power

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I got a couple emails and I said, you know what?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're right, I should bring back the rock money and off once in a while

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Just to get into the vibe, the feel, the power of your intellect

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Everybody, how you do it?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're halfway through the week, it's Wednesday

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I'm really early here in the morning to bring you your daily source code

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Coming up today, your Metro sexual moment

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Of course, since I'm in San Francisco

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The whole entity of talk about the macro world

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And the new products that Apple has been announcing

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What's up with our microphone sounds kind of low here today

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And just to let you know, you are host with the show

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Although fully capable of driving the equipment

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is only dressed in a white house code

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And black up boots

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I mean, who needs more?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Damn, it is foggy outside this morning

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All right, so we're going to get all kinds of stuff today

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Stuff going on around the office, stuff going on around San Francisco

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Stuff going on last night, stuff that's happening today

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's truly going to be one of those shows that the jam pack

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And just about everything

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you're listening to us on a serious start 103

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How to y'all?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's the patchy old

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Kick it off a crazy infatuation from the road or not a band

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No context, no more games

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think this boat is on a little insane

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He's got me so many stuff

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I don't know what to do

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Next emotions runs so hot

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
One minute I am the next I'm not

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He's got me so many stuff

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I don't know what to do

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a crazy infatuation

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm a cell

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
One minute you wait to go

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm stuck in this crazy infatuation

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't more I get to know you

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The more scares me so

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Meal smooth, a little too fast

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
One kiss I forget the past

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm so mixed up

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know what to do

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Turn the tables, make them run

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You have no mercy for anyone

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm so mixed up

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know what to do

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a crazy infatuation

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
By myself

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
One minute you wait to go

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm stuck in this crazy infatuation

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The more I get to know you

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The more scares me so

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I've got to turn this around

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you were to get my feet off the ground

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Tell us why if it's lost the ground

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't begin my feet back on the ground

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Wild dreams and type things

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If this is love, it's not what it seems

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's got your soul mixed up

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know what to do

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It reminds me sweet goodbye

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I want you to go about my heart just dies

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's got your soul mixed up

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't know what to do

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a crazy infatuation

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
By myself

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
One minute you wait to go

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm stuck in this crazy infatuation

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The more I get to know you

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The more scares me so

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The more I get to know you

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The more scares me so

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The more scares me so

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The more you get to know you

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The more you get to know you

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The more scares me so

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The more scares me so

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm stuck in this crazy infatuation

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I want you to go about

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,760
Patricia's already, what the hell is she doing? It's already she's almost ready for Christina to come home from school

91
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,120
I hate this I hate being on this side of the clock

92
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,800
Because I'm a night guy. I'd like to stay up late, but it doesn't work that way

93
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,360
Not when you're out here not when you got to get shows out not when you got to do stuff

94
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Big day today

95
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,440
You know I've talked about

96
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,000
Hold on a second my Mac is doing all kinds of stuff here today. It's syncing and updating and

97
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,000
God knows what oh, of course. I did the the Mac OS X OS 10 update. That's where it is. Anyway

98
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,760
today the ZDF

99
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,520
due to the deutsch's fans in will be visiting the condo

100
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,200
This is in Germany. They have I think I was at like two or maybe three really main big television channels

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,040
That it's not just for Germany. I mean these these German television stations. They're all over the you know German speaking

102
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,120
portions of the world. So it's Germany. It's Austria

103
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,760
portions of Italy, Switzerland. I mean it's just huge. I mean anyone

104
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Who knows anything about

105
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,760
German media is just that the numbers are astronomical and

106
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
despite

107
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
the huge influence that

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,880
That the German public broadcasters have and I guess there

109
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,160
There must be some there must be some commercial broad. I don't know enough about the German media seemed to be quite honest

110
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,160
But there's a lot of podcasting going on in Germany. There's a lot of pod safe music showing up from Germany

111
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Particularly reggae interestingly enough

112
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,840
Sometimes even in German language German language reggae. Go ahead look for it on the pod save music network. You'll see what I mean

113
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,800
So they're coming here to interview me and

114
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,840
And the one thing every single television now if it will always say is okay, you know we've got these

115
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,120
Wait let me do the German okay if you have this great idea for them

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,120
Fatima the pod thought of we're going to

117
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
They're mocking him

118
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Making a podcast

119
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,440
Every single time it's like no

120
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm not gonna do that

121
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
That's my magic, you know

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,560
That's that's it's my magic. I don't want I don't want you to see when I'm doing this

123
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll be making a video podcast don't you think

124
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,480
But I did say that okay they wanted a real San Francisco vibe

125
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,320
I said once you come up to the to the condo because I've got the you know the 180 degree

126
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,720
View of the day and of the financial district and the Bramuda Triangle here in Soma that I call home

127
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,320
Because there's nothing here nothing going on except concrete and as I look out the window today

128
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,640
I have visibility of oh, let's say 50 feet. It is the foggyest day yet

129
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,080
And I hope it's gonna burn off because they'll be here a little bit later on, but so far looking pretty damn bleak

130
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,880
So I don't know maybe I'll have to at least show them my equipment

131
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,360
My podcast equipment that is to make them feel like they've got some kind of groovy shot going on

132
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
And what do I have here? Well, I have

133
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
My power book

134
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,640
outdated just bought it. I have my iMac G5 just bought it outdated

135
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,520
I don't feel too good about that. I mean doesn't seem like apples releasing stuff a little bit too fast. You know, I just just

136
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
You know, I haven't even made my first real

137
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
You know

138
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,680
Scratch on any of my machines, you know, there's there's so new as I have no real incentive to go out and buy a new one

139
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,520
Yeah, yeah much faster. Well, we'll talk about that a little bit later on today, obviously

140
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,240
Let me see we got some more pod save music coming up as I said in the rock mining off intro

141
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,720
Which I brought back for you know, just to feel good today

142
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,880
We'll be doing a metro sexual moment and I'd also like to talk a little bit about the demo that I received of

143
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
of

144
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,680
All the stuff that has been going on at the pod show HQ

145
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,960
Which will be something you'll be able to see pretty soon, too, I guess

146
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,800
First let's get to some audio feedback. This one was pretty funny, actually

147
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,080
Hi Adam. This is Rachel from the audio collective pod cast

148
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,400
We do our podcast with myself my husband David and our friend Cory

149
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,720
We of course influence to new podcasting because of you and the daily source code and at first it was okay

150
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,880
But then things started happening

151
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:14,760
David's been influenced to not only start his own podcast, but to buy things like in iPod then in I river in I dog

152
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,800
Then a Mac mini which he claims was for me an m3 power razor, which he is very proud of right now

153
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,280
a frothy since sao coffee maker to add to the list and

154
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,840
And lately he's been saying the numbers and letter combinations 1 8 2 RG

155
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm not sure if I'm gonna let him get that yet, but Adam we've got a talk

156
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,680
You've either got to provide us with a better way to support our

157
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,360
Daily source code buying habits or help us out give David a job or something we just need the extra cash

158
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,400
Because you're doing such a great job advertising

159
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,560
Unfortunately, we have a hard time pain or mortgage bill. So please help

160
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,920
Thanks and keep on the great show. This is Rachel from the audio collective pod cast at audiocollective.net

161
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,920
So Rachel he's got he's got all these groovy goodies even once a

162
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,920
Charlie 182 Romeo golf that would be the sessna

163
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Won't just come over here, baby. Come over to the condo and get the real thing

164
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
See all the real equipment

165
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Actually with what I saw yesterday at pod show

166
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,760
You will be able to make some extra money and I believe that some people will be able to quit their day jobs and we've got

167
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,200
I think we've got it figured out man. I was so blown away

168
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,000
yesterday because the the thing that the yeah, of course, there's a huge piece that we're focusing on for pod casters

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,320
But what I was really really happy about what I saw yesterday at pod show which will be releasing

170
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
I guess in drips and drives

171
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,720
This is not the kind of thing you say oh and here it is come on in you know, it's just it's too much we've got a

172
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,960
Releasing in bits and pieces but for listeners my god

173
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Man think about one click subscription

174
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:08,040
You know just just don't even think about subscription just get a show. Okay, become a registered listener to a show

175
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,560
Find out who else is listening to the show provide comments easy way to do audio comments easy way to keep track of your favorite shows

176
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,560
Easy way to sync up the pod cast the elixine to across multiple machines whether

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,680
Regardless of what operating system you're using so if you have shows that you listen to at

178
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,280
At home you can have the same shows waiting for you at work

179
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Spin it off and any device you want

180
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:45,800
Participate in show notes. I mean, it's just it's gonna be unbelievable and some of it's actually some of the wacky age acts 2.0 stuff which we love so much

181
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,000
So I think we're gonna spend the rest of this week

182
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,240
Doing some iterative loops going around around around a processing stuff then we have let me have like

183
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Well a number of new pod casters were bringing into the pod show network and they're actually going to be our first

184
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,280
Real beta testers because they'll be beta testing the podcasting side of the equation

185
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,640
But also the listening side and everyone now at the office has become a listener and

186
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,720
Man, it's it's fun. You know, you what happens is you you go into what you can't go in there yet

187
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,160
But you'll be going into podshow.com and it's just like you don't want to stop you're just finding all this new stuff and and

188
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,400
hooking up with with people and other listeners

189
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,040
I think that's really and you know the what I'm really happy about is that what I'm seeing is we're going to

190
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,800
strengthen the bond

191
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,080
between listeners and podcasts and podcasters

192
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
because right now

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,360
The the whole concept of the technology underneath podcasting you know RSS and subscriptions

194
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,720
That's seen as the as the relationship, but it's really not working that well as a as a relationship for a whole bunch of reasons

195
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,080
Mainly because you don't know who's at the other end of the subscription and it

196
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,520
Then it really does help if if you can make that connection

197
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
So really becoming a member of

198
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,560
Listening audience to to a podcast or multiple podcasts and then having that that connection that two-way street working

199
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,720
You know even better than just the asynchronous part that we're doing here with me talking and you sending something back once in a while

200
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,880
So be on the lookout for that more updates of course as we move along

201
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,480
I may we'll talk a little bit later later on the show about it after rev closed the satellite window last night

202
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,800
I was going to do the actual is going to do the show last night because I knew that had a big day today

203
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Went over to Ron's house

204
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,000
Had a quick bite to eat because he's been having problem. You know

205
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,960
He's maximum and I'm telling you so I have the the old now

206
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
The outdated power book

207
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,480
G4, but you know the with the 1.67

208
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Gigerhertz processor or whatever

209
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
And I still have that audio problem

210
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,440
In fact while I was prepping the show for today even though I downloaded the new quick time update and the new OS 10 update

211
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Damn if it didn't come back

212
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,040
And Ron

213
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,960
You know he's been in musicians since longer than I've been on this planet earth and

214
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,400
He finally went back to to setting up his studio and he got himself the 17 inch

215
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,400
High-end power book which now of course is also outdated and he's using logic pro

216
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,400
And it's the wackiest thing and of course

217
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
You know this is something that

218
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,400
That is not new

219
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,520
We looked it up on on the web and saw that this error basically if you have more

220
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Like five tracks or something

221
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,920
His CPU load, you know goes right off the scale and then it stops playing and you get a core audio error

222
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
110011

223
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,480
Which basically means yeah your CPU is is maxed out

224
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,320
But that shouldn't be happening with just a couple of tracks especially not on a on a machine that powerful

225
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
I mean I've I've run pro tools on

226
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
And you know like whatever

227
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,400
Dec and and stuff like that with with maybe 20 tracks without a problem on really old hardware so

228
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,160
Little down on the apple stuff right now. I have to say

229
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Let me see I had

230
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I have a little a couple of things of course

231
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
When I did get back last night in lieu of

232
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,280
of going

233
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Deep into the night and recording a show I looked at the Steve Jobs keynote which no longer is live

234
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,000
I find I thought they used to do that live they would

235
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,840
Webcast the keynote at the same time but they don't do that so

236
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,360
It came out late last night and some of the highlights of course

237
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,440
The one that that I like the most is that apple over the Christmas quarter so that's the past three months

238
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,120
Sold 14 million iPods that's 14 million people

239
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,120
Who are out there walking around with a

240
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,880
Hard drive that can be filled up with all kinds of stuff besides what you get from the iTunes music store

241
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,080
It can be filled up with pod safe music tons of it

242
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Oh, and by the way

243
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,120
The purchasing for pod safe music I think that that will be

244
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
We'll be beta testing that this weekend

245
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,720
We have a board of directors meeting coming up next week and I more or less promised that it will be done by then

246
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,520
So it will be it will be done by then and maybe ready for prime time by the end of next week

247
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,760
So that was cool of course the new max came out the new Intel processor based max

248
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,080
I think I'll wait for a couple of generations of machines before I switch to that

249
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:30,840
I'm a little bit tired of paying to be a beta tester for apple still love the stuff, but I just cannot believe

250
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,600
Can't believe these are audio problems which is why you have them back in many cases

251
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Of course the big news

252
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,800
I thought yesterday was that I life oh six which means that now you can

253
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,480
picture cast although that seems to pretty much only work from

254
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:57,560
From that from Mac to Mac although it will be an RSS feed there was no demonstration of how the RSS feed works and what happens when you remove pictures from your

255
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:06,600
From your photo cast published folder, so you know that was a little unclear, but the podcast studio and garage band certainly one way of doing it

256
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,520
With multiple tracks you could even see when when Steve was doing the demo that you know

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,840
It did turn out really well actually, but of course it was completely you know pre-produced to even had to read his

258
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:27,400
His little his little podcast thing, you know verbatim to you know put it into the right amount of time so he could drag in this his music track

259
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Auto ducking so when you start talking the music

260
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,600
Automatically goes down low well that's something we've had in cast blasters since almost day one so

261
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,760
for those of you who aren't fortunate enough to be an owner of

262
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Macintosh stuff

263
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,880
and you got windows and you want to you know have a cool podcast studio check out cast blaster dot com

264
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,880
It does all that and then some and you don't need a

265
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,760
Dot Mac account to publish I don't know if you actually need that for garage band if you it probably no of course

266
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:07,800
Now you can probably just you can just spin it out but the big offer here and I did look up on the looking to that the big offer on

267
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,840
On the podcast studio if you buy your what I think it's $99 is it $99? Yeah, I think it's

268
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,200
It's something like 10 bucks a month for for your dot Mac account and you get three what is it

269
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,960
Man, I should have looked at something like an idiot

270
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,440
You get some storage which I believe is one gigabyte of storage and if you look at all the details

271
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:46,040
You get 25 gigabytes of data transfer per month and that really does kind of work out to what I figured it would be because if you do the math and of course

272
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,280
Apple doesn't doesn't own bandwidth

273
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,200
They purchase it and of course they I think they own a stake in

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,760
What is it to an akamai who delivers all that stuff it runs on the akamai network?

275
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
But they have to basically

276
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,160
Buy that on the quote unquote free market and I think that they are pretty much somewhere between

277
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,160
27 and 35 cents per gigabyte of data transfer now podcasts as we'll know what that means

278
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,480
Because you know if you get a whole bunch of people listening to your show

279
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,960
Well, you run out of bandwidth and Apple will certainly be great for the smaller individual stuff. I think anything

280
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,520
under

281
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
probably under

282
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,240
a couple hundred listeners and if you do that

283
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,440
You know no more than once or twice a week, then you should be okay. It depends on how long your show is

284
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,200
You know what what quality you recorded at

285
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
But it certainly is not free

286
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,840
Hey, this I hate having to bend over. I need another podcast complex here. I'm like leaning on my arms during the entire show

287
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,400
I did get a funny email a couple of people notice this stick actually

288
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,920
Send the two of me said that did you see the the mac world keynote

289
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,440
When Steve was the demoing the I web

290
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,680
So this is you know and that was by the way very very very cool

291
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:15,720
You know to create a website with blogs all click and you know point click shoot and it just kind of all works and that was very very

292
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,480
Zippy

293
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,480
So what Steve wanted to say was

294
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,640
When you're done creating a website push one button except what he said was

295
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,120
When you're done creating a website push one button. I did hear that

296
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,480
He kind of like weather website like okay. I'm glad you made me a website man

297
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,480
Very cool

298
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Let me see I got

299
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Another song coming up from Barry Coral attached to a promo so hold off on that because we've got only a couple more

300
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,520
Minutes here with our folks on the satellite for those of you

301
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:53,960
New to to serious stars one oh three you might have purchased your serious box over the Christmas to listen to Howard

302
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Maybe receive that as a gift

303
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,640
Here on channel one oh three every afternoon from six to ten eastern from three to seven Pacific we roll out the pod show

304
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,000
Today is one of those special days. We got

305
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,560
The roving bit in the middle after myself Pacific coast hellway

306
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,360
Madgelinestein I think is it the Frank true the thing it might be Brian know who's on today

307
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,280
Sometimes beat-up slips in there with with digital flots and

308
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,280
So make sure you just to hang out here we got it all going on, baby metro sexual moment coming up

309
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,840
I've received an email if someone said something that the metro sexual moment was not here it is word on

310
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Vogue I Adam says jail

311
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,800
I knew they hate getting emails as opposed to voice feedback by my works. I don't have easy access to Mike right now

312
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
What kind of excuses that

313
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,560
This is in regards to the constant use of the word metro sexual the word was coined back in

314
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,480
2004 so any guy who referred to himself as a metro sexual back in 2004 wouldn't still call himself a metro

315
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Sexual because the word has just become passe. I think the word developed into uber sexual in 2005

316
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,680
But now that it's 2006. I'm not sure what the term will be

317
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,920
By the way, I love the show. Thank you, Joe. Okay. I don't know. I'm you know we got the imaging

318
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,320
We got the jingles from metro sexual moment so why don't we keep it at that until someone comes up with something better

319
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm sure that uber sexual was kind of cool

320
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,760
Well, maybe we are just still kind of metro sexual. You know maybe we are a little bit behind the times

321
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,600
We haven't talked about you know men's health and beauty and shaving and smelling nice and you know we haven't done that

322
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,280
So maybe you are in 2004 maybe men are just behind the time it could be

323
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
I see

324
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Something else was going to talk to you about here

325
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
I don't know

326
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,400
I really don't remember

327
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm sorry. It's too early. What time is it? It's now

328
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,000
7 30 a.m. I only slept for like six hours

329
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,080
And it's going to be another really long day and I know you don't care

330
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,320
You shouldn't care you shouldn't feel bad because you've got your own miserable life. Oh wait the fog is clearing

331
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,560
I can I now have 150 feet yeah at least 150 foot view so maybe the Germans will be happy after all

332
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,320
Funny thing the Germans yeah come from the Netherlands where I grew up

333
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Whenever Germans show up we yeah we have this like love hate relationship has something to do with

334
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,680
1940 to 1945 and there was some other thing in

335
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
1920 before that

336
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,600
1918

337
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,920
But the thing we always say is hey good to have you here. I want my bike back

338
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,840
Now if you're Dutch you're laughing if you're German you're probably not laughing but hope

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,680

379
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,320

386
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,880
I didn't know that every night will make it the last to me

387

Well, I just gotta get through this world. I just gotta get through this world. I'm just gotta get through this world. I'm gonna sparring

But you believe the love is hidden everywhere in the darkest nights

395
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:16,400
They're lightning bugs that shine for you when you can't see the light

396
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Well I just gotta get to this run

I'm just the way you are

00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Not just the wrong way

407
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Mary, Cloroll

408
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,400
And a bit of a podcast confessions of an indie girl

409
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
It's cool about berries that I met her

410
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
That's B-A-R-I, by the way

411
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
K-O-R-A-L

412
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Verychoral.com

413
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Or you can find her at music.podshow.com

414
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
When I was doing a radio show

415
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
In the Netherlands a couple years back

416
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
She was on tour

417
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
She came through, I think, was Holland, Germany

418
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
She made it been to France, I think

419
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,400
And she, I can't remember exactly how it happened

420
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,400
But she stopped by and she played a couple songs live

421
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
And at the time I was like, wow, this is really cool

422
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
And she always has no major record label

423
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
She was selling out gigs all over the place

424
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Doing clubs and stuff

425
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
And it's so cool to have her back

426
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
In my life

427
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Through podsake music

428
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Of course her brother Howard Greenstein does

429
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Does a whole bunch of stuff for promoting her

430
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
And helping her out

431
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
And he has his own career too

432
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
But thanks guys, really appreciate it

433
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Great song, love it, very very much

434
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Hey everybody, it is time

435
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Metro section

436
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Metro section

437
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Metro section

438
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Metro section

439
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
It's an increase

440
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Metro section moment

441
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
It's never bought enough

442
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
And increased Metro section moment

443
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Okay, by the way, I see that

444
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,400
The recording has been skipping at least six times

445
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
That's probably when my Mac decided to do shit on its own

446
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
That I didn't ask it to and it just sinks stuff up

447
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
So I apologize and shouldn't

448
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Be any problem for the rest of the show

449
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
So let's start off today

450
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Oh Horrors

451
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I remembered yesterday

452
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,400
When I was preparing for the German television interview

453
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I didn't bring my Mac up back

454
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Oh yeah

455
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Little secret

456
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Well it's not really a secret

457
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
But I've worn

458
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Make up a lot

459
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Throughout my life

460
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Particularly when I was working MTV every single day

461
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
But back then

462
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
And she do my makeup and I learned a lot

463
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
And check this out

464
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
How Metro section is this?

465
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
I said to Ron's wife, Marta is at Marta

466
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,400
You know, Kai Barrel, she's Latino

467
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Latina, she said

468
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,400
And she said, well, you know, you can't borrow my makeup

469
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Because the color she uses is way too dark

470
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,400
And she was so sweet she went out and bought me a whole set of Mac makeup

471
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
But now I blew it already

472
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Because I was supposed to take the brush

473
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,400
She bought me a beautiful brush from Mac

474
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
I think it is

475
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
How coincidental

476
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,400
And I was supposed to shampoo it and wash it

477
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
And leave it dry overnight

478
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
So it'll be nice and fluffy

479
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Oops, fuck that up

480
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
So hopefully it'll work

481
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I'll take pictures

482
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
So you can see me doing my makeup

483
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
We've got some audio feedback

484
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
For today's Metro section moment

485
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
So let me just

486
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
I want to second how we do that

487
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
We did it like this

488
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Right?

489
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
We bring that down

490
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Oh my god

491
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Sorry

492
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Because that fabulous auto ducking feature

493
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400

Have you used your hair to floss

498
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
And you have so much hair on your back

499
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
You can cause a scene when you take off your shirt

500
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,400

When it comes to Metro sexual moment

539
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Hi

540
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Let's see a couple of pieces of feet back here

541
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Timothy Pilgrim Adam

542
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Love the podcast

543
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Especially the Metro sexual moment

544
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
And Trinity moments

545
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Yeah, I got one of those coming up later on this week as well

546
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
What are you guys?

547
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Total losses?

548
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
I shave in the shower

549
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
By feel no mirror

550
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
No cream, no after shave

551
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
No problem

552
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Oh, comes out smooth

553
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
There's a baby's butt

554
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
And the wife loves it

555
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Dude

556
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
You've got a moisturizer

557
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
You got to

558
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Otherwise

559
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
You're going to wake up one day

560
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Your face is going to be all cracked up

561
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
As for Trinity

562
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Timothy says

563
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Oh yeah, this whole biodiesel thing

564
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
I'm sorry

565
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Didn't mean to confuse that

566
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Onto the M3 power in the shower

567
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
From Matt's not grass

568
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Starting here you've had some different culpants

569
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
With the Gillette M3 power

570
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
I should have mentioned that the M3 power

571
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Was designed to be used in the shower

572
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
I find that the shower is the perfect place

573
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
With the closest shave in a steamy hot environment

574
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Your beard is much softer for shaving

575
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Give it a try

576
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
The only downside is that the fogless mirror

577
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Was always fog up after about a month

578
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Was that true?

579
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,400
You know, there is quite a culture of guys

580
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Who shave in the shower

581
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
That's not my culture

582
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Because I have the reason why I guess

583
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
I don't like to get my hair wet

584
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
God how Metro sexual in my today

585
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
I don't like to get my hair wet

586
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
So, you know, I think that

587
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,400
It's probably just better to in front of the shower

588
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Okay, we have another Metro sexual moment

589
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Contribution here

590
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Hold on a second

591
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I'm loving it guys

592
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Thank you very much

593
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I really appreciate the fact that you're sending audio feedback

594
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Hi Adam

595
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
This is Bernie Zabord

596
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
From the Martian Chronicles

597
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
The most improbable podcast on the planet

598
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,400
With only one episode released in 2005

599
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,400
I'd like to share with you my own personal debons shaving

600
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Which was given to me by an esthetician girlfriend of mine

601
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,400
Basically, she told me to use a official scrub

602
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
On a weekly basis

603
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Before shaving

604
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Because she told me as she told me wrong

605
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
That it removes the dead skin and grease

606
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
And everything that gets encrusted

607
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Into your skin

608
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,400
And then it eases up the work of the blade

609
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,400
So, that does work

610
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
And you do end up in the oven

611
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

612
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Hey, how cool

613
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
I hadn't heard that for a while

614
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
You probably won't be the only one in house to enjoy it

615
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
By the way

616
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Well, that was my contribution

617
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
The Metro sexual moment

618
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
And hopefully we'd have a word of encouragement

619
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
From the Pathfather himself

620
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
The Martian Chronicles

621
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Bombay that impubole anymore in 2006

622
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Well, keep up the good work

623
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
And thanks for listening

624
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Bye

625
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Yeah, we do thank you very much

626
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
I apologize about the

627
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
The apple problem that I just had there

628
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Second time in this show

629
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Cutting

630
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Scream off

631
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
What's crazy about this is

632
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
I don't think I had it for the first month

633
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
That I had this machine

634
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Okay

635
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Back to then

636
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Center myself

637
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
We're still in our Metro sexual moment here

638
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Let's calm down

639
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
David Toasty

640
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
He says

641
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Noxima Creme

642
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
I find it does a really good job

643
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Better than the shaving creams

644
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
To soften up the hairs

645
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
But I stopped a few years ago

646
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
To be using electric razor now

647
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Since using a blade

648
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Does a number on my skin

649
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Plus

650
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
It's a moisturizer as well

651
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
You know, I've used that in a pinch

652
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
I've used some noxima

653
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
But I kind of swear by the

654
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Gillette gel

655
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
And I guess the jury is so kind about

656
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Is it really the products you use to give you the better shave

657
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Or is it the technique

658
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Or is it the razor

659
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Let's see

660
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Robert Walsh

661
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Oh, of course

662
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
That's Rob from podcast 4

663
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,400
And he pointed out a podcast called

664
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
What is it?

665
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Cancer

666
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
It's a cancer.com

667
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
It's about women who shave

668
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Everywhere

669
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
The Rob you're a sick puppy, man

670
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,400
It's a keto alpha tango Sierra uniform

671
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Robio tango hotel.com

672
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
I'm not going to play that piece

673
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Because it kind of ruins my home

674
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Metro sexual divide

675
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
You know what?

676
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Let's keep it that

677
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
This was our Metro sexual moment

678
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
For Wednesday

679
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
I said Wednesday

680
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Metro sexual moment

681
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Yeah

682
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
The Metro sexual moment

683
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Do you believe anything is possible?

684
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Fuck

685
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I was going to say

686
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Metro sexual moment

687
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Is brought to you by Earthling

688
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Do you believe anything is possible?

689
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
We do

690
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Where are flink?

691
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
We believe in an internet

692
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
That's safe from viruses and scammers

693
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
We're Earthling

694
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,400
We believe your personal information

695
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Should be just that

696
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Personal

697
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
And we believe your internet

698
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Should be a friend

699
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Not a fo

700
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
We're Earthling

701
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400

702
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400

Earthling

706
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
We revolve around you

707
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
I wish we had like an earthling for

708
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Shaving

709
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
That would really help

710
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
If we had a company that

711
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
It really helped us with

712
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Shaving the way Earthling helps us with

713
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Being connected, staying connected

714
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
And protecting your data

715
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
And protecting your privacy

716
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
You know that would be something

717
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
I wouldn't really look forward to

718
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Okay

719
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
I was going to bitch about iTunes

720
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Maybe I shouldn't do that

721
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Other than the fact that

722
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
People are having all kind

723
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
You know I read somewhere

724
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
And I don't see how this can be true

725
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
But I read that a lot of

726
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
People are having problems with

727
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
iTunes downloading podcasts

728
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Because ISPs around

729
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Certainly around the US

730
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
But perhaps around the world

731
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Have been installing all kinds of filters

732
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
And all kinds of trickery

733
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
To

734
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Basically I think it's to stop

735
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Bit torn which makes no sense

736
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Because that's using completely

737
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Different ports on your computer

738
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
But we are seeing people

739
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Often on the same

740
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Segment

741
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
So a particular ISP

742
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Who are getting broken downloads

743
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,400
And if you're seeing this problem

744
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Let me know

745
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
And also let me know

746
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Send me an email

747
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
And I'll probably send you back a few technical questions

748
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
And some stuff that you can look up

749
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Easily on your computer

750
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
We can find out of

751
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Where these problems are coming from

752
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,400
But it definitely seems to be a problem

753
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Okay

754
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
So I don't want to bitch about that too much

755
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
I did see the

756
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Was it

757
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I saw a piece of video

758
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Let me just see if I can tell you what that video was from

759
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
It was a video of podcast or content

760
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
It was really good

761
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
I think it was the Mac podcast

762
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Let me see

763
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Where is it?

764
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Let me just look at my

765
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Looking at all my shows

766
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
That I'm subscribed to

767
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Where is it?

768
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Where is it?

769
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Where is it?

770
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,400
It's Shelley the Republican

771
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Oh the new pod finders up

772
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Podfighter episode 15

773
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
That's cool

774
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,400
The first one of the new year

775
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Maybe I should do a little search here

776
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
For podcaster

777
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Cone, podcaster

778
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Or is it pod?

779
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Was it podcaster

780
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Cone?

781
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Yeah here it is

782
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
The Mac Pro podcast

783
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
That's what it was

784
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Hey, it was a great

785
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
It was like a 12 or 13 minute video podcast

786
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Was really good

787
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
And it was about the

788
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Is really an impression of the podcaster

789
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Con

790
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
They went on in that

791
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Was it South Carolina?

792
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
I think

793
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Which unfortunately I couldn't go to

794
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Because I was in the UK

795
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I really would have wanted to go

796
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Because a lot of people there

797
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
There were teams that recognized

798
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Which shows I listened to

799
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
And what was kind of amazing to me

800
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Is that I haven't

801
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
Hard a lot of podcast

802
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Coming from podcaster

803
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Con

804
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
I heard the legal discussion

805
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Which was really poor audio

806
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Recording

807
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Yeah, kind of like live Mike sounds

808
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
It was a little hard to hear

809
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,400
But that was a very interesting

810
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Very interesting session

811
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
I was wondering if there were more sessions

812
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Or if there was an archive

813
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
I looked at the podcaster

814
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Con wickie and couldn't really find it

815
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Because I know that

816
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,980
There was a lot of good stuff that was discussed there.

817
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:04,440
Madge Weinstein filled me in on she was there, probably a sleuth undercover, but she gave

818
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,000
me some feedback on that and I'd just like to know more about some of the conversations

819
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,160
and did we come to any conclusions to what did we learn so please do let me know.

820
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,480
And then to wrap it up today, for those of you who don't know the show notes for this

821
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,720
podcast, there's two basic show notes that's kind of like a rundown that I post along

822
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,920
with the show, which shows up probably in your pod catcher, if you're using the juice

823
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,600
receiver, if you're using iTunes or something else, also what shows up on the individual

824
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,160
posting on the show site.

825
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,560
But then there's a link to what we call the time code based show notes, which is really

826
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,920
a misnomer, even though it is kind of done by time codes, what it is, it's a wiki

827
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,920
show notes.

828
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,120
And this was set up by show notes, Michael at show notes.info, and this thing is growing and I'm

829
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,600
really, really happy for him because it was just kind of an idea, but I threw out there,

830
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,640
he set it up, you know, all on his own dime, his own time.

831
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,640
And he's got a lot of shows that are now using the whole concept of user-generated show

832
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
notes.

833
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
And he has a message for us all.

834
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,760
Hey Adam, it's Michael over from show notes.info, I just wanted to drop you a line to let

835
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,560
you and your listeners know that I've created a Google group for the show notes website.

836
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:23,120
The purpose of that is because now that a lot of people are updating the show notes,

837
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,120
not just me, sometimes editorial things come up, people maybe need to change other people's

838
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
comments.

839
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,080
And there's no real good way right now to let people know why you're making changes,

840
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,120
maybe that you think are going to affect somebody else.

841
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,720
So I just wanted to let you and your listeners know, I mean, I don't think this is something

842
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,400
that every listener is necessarily going to want to sign up for, but certainly to people

843
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,720
that are active in updating the show notes websites and the other podcasts are out there

844
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,680
that are using the site for their show notes as well.

845
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,360
And they want to check it out.

846
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,920
The other thing that it's going to allow me to do is if I have to do any site maintenance

847
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,520
or upgrades or anything like that, I can let people who are interested know quickly through

848
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
an email.

849
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,000
So again, it's a Google group for show notes.info and there's a link to it over, I updated

850
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,280
the site news page on the wiki itself or if you just go to show notes.info, the main page,

851
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,360
there's a link to it there as well.

852
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,240
So again, just ahead's up for anybody who might be interested in checking that out.

853
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,720
All right, Michael, thank you, buddy.

854
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,960
Great job on show notes.info.

855
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,880
It's very cool.

856
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,960
We're working well and I really support that initiative and if there's anything, well,

857
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,960
he might go, you know, if there's anything I can do, you'll let me know.

858
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,080
Okay, you know, it's been 45 minutes.

859
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,840
We've, the crappy thing has been skipping and we've had, we've had a pretty out of control

860
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,640
show today and some portions really sucked.

861
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,240
I'm sorry about that tomorrow will do even better because that's the great thing about

862
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,240
podcasting.

863
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,320
