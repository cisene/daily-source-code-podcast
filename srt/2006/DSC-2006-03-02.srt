We're 16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Can I ask me this?

Fantastic.

It's Adam Curry.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In the morning sun, I rolled a fat blood

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just to wake me up.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Sometimes I find it hard to understand the way it can.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
From your point of view you'll find this true.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And you'll just roll your eyes.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But in your mind you'll see.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's just all that she thought it was.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not all that type.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not all that she thought it looked like it was.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's not the outfits you covered on front and no blame for that.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's not because it's just the dress design.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's just the dress design.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's not a pics of for themselves.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now feel it flawless.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not this style of clothing that we look kind of like.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But its not the fashion Chocolate in body but it doesn't match taste.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And tell me all the things that you do

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,520
The things that says I'll be rings

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
So grab the tubes, they just send a message

61
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Just not stay in the room

62
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,800
In the morning sun, the lignus

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,480
I don't!

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,120
From the pod save music network everybody

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,160
How you doin' welcome to the Charlie episode 3-4-5

66
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,760
Always nice when you have sequential numbers like that

67
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,600
Another beautiful day in Gilford in the...

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,840
Well, it is the sunny affluent suburb of Surrey

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,200
Better known as Gilford

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
Now cold this morning, man

71
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,560
It was minus two degrees Celsius

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,720
When I took Christina to school this morning

73
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,720
But just nice and sunny and no wind

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,360
So it's really good everyone's in great spirits

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,160
I was up way too, I don't know what happened

76
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,760
I woke up at like 6.30

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,080
You know, it was an hour before I even had to wake up

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,120
Must be some form of internal clock mechanisms that aren't

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Aren't exactly ticking correctly

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,120
And thank you all by the way

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,160
Oops, what is this?

82
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,120
Oh that's interesting

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Thank you all by the way, so much for sending in all these different ideas

84
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,480
And, oh no, what the hell happened there?

85
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,520
Good

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Sorry, little mac issue there

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,840
All the different ideas and remedies for jet lag

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,080
It really doesn't bother me all that much to be quite honest

89
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,240
It's kind of interesting that I woke up so early this morning because I know I'm really tired

90
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
I have no idea

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
It'll get better as we go along

92
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,480
So looking forward to a really nice weekend hanging out here at the cottage

93
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,520
Of course, we'll have a thank god it's Friday edition of the show tomorrow

94
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Looking forward to that lots of great stuff coming

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,080
It's really interesting all the all the feedback that's coming into this show

96
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,560
It comes in through so many different avenues

97
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,080
And also I think the show really extends beyond just the podcast

98
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
If you look at the comments on curry.com

99
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,480
Now that we have the new server, we're using wordpress now for the show site

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Not for the show site for

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,480
From my personal weblog

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
We're also do post

103
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,800
Every source code as well. It's a crosspost thing. Yeah, I'm a crossposter

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The comments there really started to heat up

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,560
And it looks like we got a little light of the stalker is going on between

106
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,240
Roger Smalls and comic strip blogger and somehow I don't know

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,080
I got some stuff to to play for you in just a couple minutes

108
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,560
Then there's the the the user show notes which is the wiki show notes at show notes dot info

109
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,320
There's lots of stuff that gets fed back there and then of course still tons and tons of of

110
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,440
email

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,880
Coming into Gmail and at 99% today. Let me just double check. Let me see my percentage is correct

112
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:38,440
The minute you hit 100 you can still receive some mail 99% yet 4056 megabytes of your 4096

113
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
So someone sends me a 40 meg file

114
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,200
Toast

115
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,600
Please don't do that. It does so many horrible things particularly to the blackberry

116
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,960
That's even I've completely given up on the blackberry push email by the way now. I'm using

117
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,760
Gmail's mobile email. It actually works pretty well now that this new blackberry have has the edge

118
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,160
Services which is really really fast and it has a faster processor internally

119
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,160
It's actually worth it just to use Gmail's online interface I found and you can and it does have it still doesn't it let you add a star

120
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Doesn't let you add a label. I don't understand why not. I mean if we can do a star let's do a label

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,240
Because now if I want to tag something for the source code instead of applying a DSC label to it

122
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,360
I have to add a star to it and then come back and search for the stars search for the stars

123
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
And then convert those into

124
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,720
Into DSC labels otherwise the searching goes well even the most frequently used emails email addresses

125
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,640
Of course it doesn't pop up in the same Java script

126
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,840
You know, what is it to Ajax kind of way that that it does in a web browser but you it does remember which ones

127
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,320
You can select from a list that enough about Gmail

128
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,040
Let me see

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,720
This is something that was I had a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't play yesterday of course because we had the lovely Patricia pie on the show

130
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,280
This was kind of interesting though because it shows this next comment shows how podcasts are being used internally

131
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:09,320
Within businesses and not just you know for business talk, but they also want to make it entertaining and there's nothing against making

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,040
You know business information entertaining

133
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,760
But there are some issues when it comes to the pod safe music network

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,720
It's crystal in daily source code three for three you played the feedback from Martin who is an internal or internet podcast

135
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,680
Like I am and you don't get the problem

136
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,560
Which is basically that we cannot complete the registration process or our podcasts are never getting verified

137
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,800
So we never become members at spotcasters of the

138
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,640
Pod safe music network since our feeds exist behind our firewalls in our

139
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Internet so

140
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,320
There's no way for us to get the access to the pod safe music and

141
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,880
I think it's a shame since podcasting is such a great way to bridge the

142
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,720
The gap between cultures and between people in a highly

143
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,920
Distributed environment so we'll be great if you guys could provide some sort of checkbox

144
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,680
That allows us to indicate it's an internet podcast and there's no way for you to verify it

145
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,360
And the rest certainly is something we can do provide feedback and group or report and

146
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,320
Usage, but we simply cannot pass this hurdle

147
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,400
So maybe something for you guys to consider thanks a lot and take care

148
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,880
Right, okay, so now I finally understand that I guess there's some form of verification

149
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,160
When you sign up as a podcast or to the pod safe music network that checks to see if your feed is actual for real

150
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,560
Actually for real so that it I guess it validates to whatever. Hey, what's that?

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
The bad phone ringing

152
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,520
Okay, so this makes sense it makes sense that you can't validate it and it makes sense that we should have a different verification procedure

153
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,080
Absolutely, so we'll we'll get on that. I'm not quite sure what we're gonna do or how we're gonna do it

154
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,600
But there is absolutely no reason whatsoever that you know an internal

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,640
Podcast which is not for the general public shouldn't be able to use pod safe music network as long as you just keep to the rules of reporting back to the network and

156
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,760
Putting a link in your show notes to the to the page. That's fine. In fact, I expect that to be a great resource of new listeners

157
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,920
Holy cow

158
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay, so I know Chris Rockwell's listening to the show and we had some some conversations yesterday about

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,680
Pod safe music network

160
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,760
You know the the really the only final thing that we're

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,040
That we're waiting on for you know for rolling out our beta across the board for any artist that wants to participate

162
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,240
Is this damn email thing that I've been talking about and for those of you who missed it or didn't care the first time

163
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
It is kind of important

164
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Because if you just want to open up shop right and just set up your own company or service or anything that

165
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,960
Requires email communication quite honestly. That's just about everything unfortunately. I'm not you know, I'm not a big fan of email

166
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,080
You have a very high likelihood of getting caught in the spam filters of ISPs

167
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Most notably hotmail and MSN

168
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,600
Webmail

169
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,440
But also America online and others and now I I'd never really heard of this and of course we we have a couple of

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
What I call

171
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Social engineers or virologists who we've hired Mark and Steven also known as the emo guys

172
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,840
And and they've dealt with this before and they say yeah, you know you got a sign up for a subscription to one of these

173
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,360
Services that contacts every single ISP and make sure is that make sure that your email address

174
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,440
Once they verify that because of course, you know, they're not gonna just say I come on in and

175
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,440
You're on the white list now if you're spammer. So there is a verification process and it's really a service, you know

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,840
And the service and I have to correct myself the the standard fee for the service from from the leading provider of these services

177
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,960
Comes with a hardware as well now so you could lock a definitely lock a large chunk of money off

178
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,600
But $80,000 is like the pre-negotiation price which

179
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,560
And and I'm and obviously if you want to be in business you got to pay for it

180
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,040
But you know the alternative is is to hire someone to go and and deal with that on an individual basis and I'm pretty sure that by now

181
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Most of these larger ISPs

182
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:21,640
Don't even want to deal with it. So it does create a two tiered internet and what I'm seeing with this whole AOL email thing if if you haven't

183
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,120
If you haven't heard about this this is I think it's a part of this issue and and no other is this is not about spam

184
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,040
This is about

185
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Opening up their own service to allow

186
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Corporations to pay

187
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,800
For to have their email passed through now. I have a lot of thoughts about this

188
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,120
Um, first of all, I think that if we do have to pay to get your email

189
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,720
Even if it's just registration email or email that is

190
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Shit, you know, whatever it is

191
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,680
Um, in fact, let me just you know, I just attend thoughts went through my mind. I mean, obviously

192
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,080
The future of communication with your customers is through a published subscribe mechanism like RSS

193
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,200
So let me let me just say that upfront if I want to communicate anything

194
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,760
It would be much easier and I guess we'll just have to start doing this. This is a good idea

195
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,320
Much easier to publish things through RSS. Okay, and that can even show up in your email box like outlook has

196
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Excuse me. I am drinking one

197
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:33,480
You know, they're that what is it news gator or whatever it is you can get the plug in and and then the RSS information shows up in your email box almost as if it's email

198
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
so that would be the smart way to continue

199
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,200
You know to continue any type of conversation between a company and its customers

200
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,360
But there is that critical moment where you need to confirm someone's who they say they are and

201
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,120
I guess this is the whole you know central identification

202
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Thing that we don't have in place anywhere yet which was

203
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,720
Microsoft's passport was kind of supposed to do that

204
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:06,040
So the only way we can really do that is through email and low and behold it's the same companies Microsoft who are now you know kind of making that difficult

205
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,440
So from a from a company perspective

206
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,400
I think it blows and it's and it's it's really open to

207
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,600
It's open to fraud, you know, I mean how easy is it to say oh well our spam filters trap your email and not that company's email

208
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:28,520
So you have to start paying us a quarter of a cent per message or $80,000 with a ongoing service fee of like 20% of that's as like

209
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,360
You know easily

210
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,960
15 to 20,000 dollars per year just to have your emails delivered. That's fucked up ladies and gentlemen. I'm sorry

211
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
That is just not okay

212
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,800
And this is not about protecting the consumer. They're still going to deliver shit to you

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,040
So you know, and I think it borders on unfair practices. It really does now

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
For pod show although this was not budgeted and believe me we run on a budget

215
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
You got to run a company on a budget

216
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:04,440
We had not now there's always miscellaneous stuff and there's always you know the budget is there to as a guideline to be reevaluated

217
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,960
So it's not that big of an issue, but come on. I mean this is just it's outrageous. It really is and I think that the internet

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Particularly email

219
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,360
You know we should fight spam, but there should be a very easy way

220
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,640
To authenticate

221
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,720
Email that you're expecting if you register for a service and you and you're expecting a registration email you should be able to get that

222
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,480
I think your ISP is doing you a disservice in fact how interesting is this going to be for Earthling?

223
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,440
I got to talk to Earthling about this. I wonder what their policies. I have not seen them on any of these lists actually

224
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,680
It seems to be much more the the MSNs and hot males of the world and the AOLs

225
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,280
Interesting, but if you've probably seen this happen before and I've gotten tons of email from people saying wow

226
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,560
That's really funny because now I understand why I thought my software was broken my email software wasn't working

227
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,680
I registered for something and then I never got the registration email

228
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Food for thought for sure

229
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,720
Oh boy, I'm gonna fit some stuff in today. Let me get this roll in first

230
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Oh, yes, everybody

231
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,600
Feel free to sing along if you know the words to this jingle

232
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,840
As right it's time to talk about the biodiesel industry alternative fuels and of course my lovely vehicle

233
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:42,040
Which I didn't even start this time around the weather was so nice in San Francisco. I never fired Trinity up to see if you still work

234
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Hopefully she is

235
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,400
Just one topic in today's Trinity segment. I Adam says Charlie Thompson discovered thanks partially to our local

236
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,520
Musical resident Willie Nelson that biodiesel is readily available for $2.84

237
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Sense of gallon here in Austin, Texas, so I'm mixed up a 30% biodiesel mixture

238
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,720
Tail on the water so to speak and filled up my diesel tractor

239
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,440
Here's a link to my biodiesel sound seeing tour with the tractor

240
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,160
Thank you very much for getting me on the biodiesel jacks

241
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,760
So I'm gonna because it's a sound seeing tour I'm pulling down the music so you can really fully enjoy this because it's a good one

242
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:22,520
So crank up the earbuds jam it in your ear and check this out. Oh, it's a beautiful day to walk to the barn here in Austin, Texas

243
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Okay, we're out here in the barn

244
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
With my three horses

245
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
And what we've done

246
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Can you hear that horse

247
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Yeah, give a big snort

248
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,880
What we've done is we've mixed a 30% mixture in the kabota 2500

249
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
tractor hands climb up on it

250
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Turn on the fuel

251
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,360
So warm day probably don't even need to glow plugs

252
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,920
Sure, we're in neutral

253
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Preflights complete

254
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Let's see if she'll start

255
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Oh

256
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Marvelous

257
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,880
Okay, if you will cut there you go, okay Adam

258
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,600
So we're running biodiesel in the tractor around here and it smells much better

259
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,760
And we only use probably 30 gallons a year so this will do it

260
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,360
Okay, Adam, I'd just like to say in closing thanks for getting me on this jag of biodiesel and

261
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,400
We're gonna run a hundred percent a summer draws near and

262
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:41,160
Really enjoy the fact that the diesel just doesn't smell as much and that we're doing something good for the earth out here at the microarrange

263
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,840
So so long from Austin, Texas. Thanks over and out

264
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,320
Good free flight and post flight my friend excellent

265
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Oh

266
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,720
You know what you said it was nice smelling and good for the farm and all that and good for the environment

267
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,880
But it's also good that we can know that we don't have independence on oil

268
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Isn't this exactly what our president said?

269
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm so proud of you. You're not doing this just

270
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,840
For Austin, Texas, not just for the farm not just because it smells good

271
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,320
You're doing it for America, my friend, and of that you should be very very proud

272
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,840
In a thank add-on for booping in her take

273
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,560
We got a podcast fight a war we've got the war of this what I call that was the war of the stalkers

274
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Now it's a stalker throw down let's put it that way and I when I say stalker

275
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,880
I mean that really only in the virtual sense of people who show up on

276
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,640
Message boards and send in audio comments. Okay. I don't really well. I'm not too sure about Roger

277
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,840
So I played this bit from Roger Smalls yesterday who was talking about I think he said the comic shit blogger

278
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,480
But I'm pretty sure he meant comic strip blogger and boy CSB really went off on that on the on the comments on

279
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,440
at curry dot com you got to join in and see what's going on there

280
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,280
He's talking lawsuits and actually let me read this posting from

281
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,000
From the web blog Adam Curry you are just a mean nasty guy you play audio comment

282
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
I'm just I'm reading it verbatim obviously

283
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,040
Comics for blogger. I think it's from Poland lives in Germany, so his English kind of drops uh something here and there

284
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,480
But I understand totally so you you play audio comment from Roger Small

285
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,840
Comment that is slander about me, but you didn't play my totally innocent audio comments besides

286
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,200
Rogers accusations are pure lies of a retard the last time I was in the UK was January 1st

287
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,440
2006 and the only countries in which I was staying lately was Germany in Spain

288
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,640
I couldn't therefore be anywhere near your house which is in the UK Adam Curry you are utterly unfair

289
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,200
You obviously are not what you pretend to be on your podcast frown face frown face I hear by officially request

290
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,000
That you will issue a apology to me in your podcast stating that these accusations were false

291
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,560
Otherwise I will sue you due to violation of British laws racial and religious hatred act and the public order act in the UK

292
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Oh

293
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,480
Man comic strip blogger chill out dude chill out

294
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,360
I'm and so what I did is I said you know dude why don't you just send me an audio comment

295
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,200
I guarantee did you make it the equal equal air time here? I'll make it the same length as

296
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,840
It's where Roger Smalls did I'm even gonna include it in the serious satellite stars cast

297
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
It's a new one we came up with the stars cast

298
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Since we have a couple minutes to go

299
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,280
Ladies and gentlemen in the interest of equal time in the stalker throw down here on the Charlie

300
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,480
This is your um in the left in the red corner

301
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,280
In the blue corner we had Roger Smalls yesterday ladies and gentlemen in the red corner

302
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,000
In the red corner it is coming strip blogger

303
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,200
2006 and the only countries in which I would stay clay to a German and Spain

304
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,960
I couldn't therefore be anywhere near your house the UK

305
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,400
So for fuck's sake behave and I'm curious

306
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,600
I should have actually preface that by telling you that it was not family safe, but I think this show was pretty much

307
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
obviously not very family safe

308
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:01,160
Interesting tune there comic strip bloggers that pot safe and if so can you get someone to put that on the pot safe music now work?

309
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,280
I love to me. Did they have an old album of that stuff it reminds me of like

310
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,040
Durwood douche a dig at man very very cool. Oh no

311
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
There's another message round

312
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
Roger Smalls

313
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Roger Smalls

314
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,640
Hello I've been Roger Hayer

315
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,640
I'm just so think out as scheduled for work at the moment and there's one thing when you want to meet you come around the cafe

316
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Thank you

317
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,640
Badger

318
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Okay

319
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:54,040
You know Roger I'm really busy this week and I think it would yeah, it's best that we that we meet on neutral terrain if you don't mind

320
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,120
So instead of me coming to your crib or the other way around I suggest you know what

321
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
It's it's interesting

322
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,840
Roger is getting quite a bit of notoriety around around the podcasting circles these days

323
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,000
And he showed up in the second

324
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,720
publication of podcast user magazine

325
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,800
He he wrote an entire article about his how he podcast and about him. I don't know if he wrote it specifically for a podcast user magazine

326
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,840
Or if they you know asked him if they could take that off his site

327
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,960
It looked like it was a screenshot of his Roger Smalls dog blogs bot.com website

328
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
So Roger

329
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:44,680
I thought it might be kind of fun since you're becoming such a celebrity for you to come and hang out with me at the Guardian Media Conference

330
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,240
Which I think is at the end of the month the March 27th I believe

331
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm gonna put you on the guest list

332
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,120
You know almost like Elvis right you know Elvis is on the guest list at many many rock shows

333
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,960
So if you want to show up I'm make sure you're on the guest list as Roger Smalls just you know bring some bring a photo ID

334
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:10,760
And I'm I'm doing a panel there and we'll we'll hook up we'll hang out and it'll be kind of a neutral territory and we can you know kind of get to know each other

335
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
I hope you're okay with that

336
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,840
Those of you checking us out on serious stars one oh three soon to be one oh two Pacific Coast Hellway is next

337
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,360
Madge Weinstein follows that dawn and Drew and it's Thursday

338
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:29,640
So I think it might be Brian know with the Frank truth that's all coming here on the pod show on serious and I'll see you guys tomorrow

339
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:37,240
Those of you still hanging out here. Thank you very much got some more audio feedback a nice block for you coming up with some and also a celebrity

340
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,640
A celebrity podcast that I hadn't heard of yet, but I stumbled across yesterday email here from

341
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Franco

342
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
He's from the rock cast Italia

343
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:58,280
Adam S. I. E. that is the Italian version of Ask Cap came out with a licensing scheme dedicated to podcasting fees changed depending on being

344
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Commercial or non-profit length of podcast percentage of show time dedicated to music here the fees it's kind of interesting

345
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,400
And I'll also read Franco's response to the fees if you are non

346
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,840
If you're non-business that means non-promotion if you are non-business what does that what the hell does that mean?

347
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,840
Okay, so if I guess that means if you're non-commercial up to 500 downloads per week

348
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,960
If you use 25 if 25 up no more than 25% of your podcast is musical content you will pay

349
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,920
120 euros a year just add you know like 10% to make it dollars

350
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,520
If you have anywhere if you use oh my god

351
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,600
If you use excuse me if you use between 25 and 70%

352
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,640
Between oh god I'm butchering this if between 25 and 75% of your podcast is musical content

353
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,280
You will pay 440 euros a year now if you have up to

354
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:11,640
15,000 downloads a week and you're using no more than 25% musical content you pay 65 euros a month

355
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,320
And if you're in the 25 to 75% musical content range it's 85 euros a month

356
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:27,160
Now this apparently is for the non-commercial podcasts and there are limitations podcasts can not last longer than 60 minutes

357
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:36,360
You can't have more than 15 songs per episode or more than 75% musical content and you must separate songs with spoken words or comments

358
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,640
So Franco correctly says I'm a non-commercial

359
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,800
podcast or get between 701,000 downloads a week so I should pay 1,020

360
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,720
euros and of course there's 18% VAT on top of that a year

361
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,960
Just for the privilege of promoting Christina Aguilera. I would rather buy a PR 40 and valve compressor

362
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,000
Actually the PR 40 I just bought the compressor I will be buying soon and I'll continue to promote Matthew

363
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,560
Ebel the Bitties and Bro low they at least say thank you when I play him right on my brother

364
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm fighting words and we love it in Italia rock cast Italia very cool man. Thanks

365
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,800
Feedback from Hank just listen to the court case podcast you know it gets me the most

366
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,560
You can't make the fact that Christina is endangered as the focus of the lawsuit

367
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,160
You had to get them via business copyright issues where did humanity go?

368
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,480
I know I know even alcohol had to be judged on tax evasion instead of murder

369
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,400
Racketeering and stuff like that so it's nothing new but it does make one thing. I hate it

370
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,360
Why can't you get the bastards on the thing that really matters? Well it would to me if or my child

371
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,960
I'm pretty sure as yours and Patricia's priority is well indeed Hank anyway

372
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,240
Just had to fire the thought off even if it probably gets lost in a few thousand other males

373
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,480
Take care fight the good fight

374
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,800
Thanks buddy

375
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
Didn't get lost. You know what's interesting though?

376
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,800
There's this organization called the EFF the electronic frontier foundation and they build

377
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,720
themselves or at least they have the image that they are an organization that fights for the rights of

378
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,520
Really a fights for online rights that have to say all digital and new media

379
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,560
They fight again. They petition and fight a lot and lobby a lot against stuff like the digital millennium copyright act

380
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
But you know twice now

381
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,320
I think that I've been in a position where there was something very important that was at hand

382
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:33,160
For the internet at large and the EFF is completely silent the first one was the MTV dot com domain name dispute

383
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,720
And I have I'm not going to go into it now, but I will say that I spoke to jump Harry Barlow in person

384
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,520
He is no longer with the EFF I believe and and I said you know dude

385
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
I need some help here

386
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,160
Yeah, well, you know, I'll bring it up somewhere and I'll talk to somebody and and you know the end of the day was they wouldn't help me

387
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,640
They would not it it cost me I think 4 450 thousand dollars

388
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,160
That one freaking lawsuit that MTV brought against me

389
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:09,640
And now with this lawsuit, which I think is critical particularly when it comes to creative comments and it's usage and and interpretation by

390
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Mainstream or old old world media

391
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,920
You know where where's the Cory doctoral articles, you know, where's the outrage from the EFF?

392
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,040
It's not there because I don't believe they're on the same agenda as you and I my friends just wanted to point that out

393
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,720
A couple of Charlie's ago and oh great now it's being used as a time reference if you Charlie's back

394
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
We had a discussion

395
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,680
Where I

396
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:41,400
Said you know if you really want to create some outrage and I believe we should have some outrage if you want the same type of outrage about the war

397
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,640
Against terror being held in Iraq

398
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:55,000
In Iraq sandbox if you want the same type of outrage that we had in the United States that we had with Vietnam

399
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,680
The two wars are often compared to each other and for some very correct reasons and some very not correct reasons

400
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:08,520
But I understand the comparison the main difference is the main difference is that the media

401
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,960
Actually showed our young men and women

402
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
slaughtered on battlefields and

403
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,320
You know that is when the shit really hits home. That is the real truth. That is what war is about wars not about

404
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
IEDs in surgeons and numbers

405
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,560
Show what's really happening

406
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,440
That will that is going to change opinion and and and I'm not talking about the opinion of the American people

407
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
But of their representatives because

408
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,560
No-one wants bad PR and that would be considered the worst of all possible PRs and we know that

409
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
the government I'm not even sure who

410
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,920
tried to restrict the publishing of photographs of coffins of

411
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,400
Service men and women with flags draped over them arriving back in the US which eventually did get out

412
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
But that was the extent of it

413
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,880
So I'm so outraged that I feel everyone should see what this is really about

414
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,480
I'm old enough to remember the pictures and the the film reels that were was were sent in

415
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,160
very very different and I think very important to show it

416
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,880
And some people agree some people disagree and some people sit right in the middle of that

417
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,960
Hi Adam this is Rebecca with training rec radio

418
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,320
Yes, I know I don't have the ideal radio voice by the way your voice turns me on

419
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,560
many times if you've been told that by a train social woman and yes, I am the real deal

420
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:46,680
Anyway, I just wanted to comment on the discussion you started in Delta Sierra Charlie 338 about

421
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,680
Photos of soldiers getting killed being printed and released in the media

422
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:01,480
I would agree that photos of soldiers getting killed would be appropriate to be released only after the journalist has received

423
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,160
Consent from the family. Otherwise, I think it's just bad taste and

424
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,560
Disrespectful to the family of the fallen soldier

425
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,120
So anyway, that's my little two cents on that issue for those of you that want to see she mail porn

426
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,920
Do a Google search for the rest of you visit my website

427
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,080
Trannywreck.com

428
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,440
That's training with two ins at a y later beaches

429
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,880
Is that one word or two words?

430
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
She may

431
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,080
Thank you very much for the feedback. I like your voice by the way. I think it's enthralling

432
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
And she mail porn. Hey, you know

433
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,280
So I'm subscribed you got an opinion a dig it now something I came across

434
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,080
Two days ago and I it just blew my stack when I heard not just the fact that this guy is doing a podcast

435
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,400
He I don't even think he knows what a podcast is. I think he's calling it an audio blog. He's blogging his ass off

436
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,760
I really like that

437
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,400
I don't think I've met him personally, but I have played his music and his videos

438
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,400
over and over. I mean, I can do

439
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,920
I know all the lyrics. I'm sure that shit just is embedded. It's it's burned into my fucking brain because of wearing headphones cranking it up

440
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,120
Known the world over and unfortunately because of the image that he had and and what happened

441
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,320
He gets ridiculed a lot which I think is unjust because I think he's a very intelligent guy and I'm gonna play this is a two and a half minute clip

442
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,920
of

443
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,080
Not just an audio blog or a podcast, but also

444
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,960
The reasoning behind him starting a weblog and starting to do

445
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,680
Podcast. I'll just call it a podcast, but I don't even think there's an RSS feed for it. So

446
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,480
I'm happy to help him out

447
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,760
Happy to to get him rolling with you know feeds and items feeds and all that stuff and anything he needs and anyone like him

448
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,000
Because I think it's great that he's come into into our world

449
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Ladies and gentlemen, MC Hammer

450
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,880
I recently spent some quality time with the

451
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:17,560
Very famous Hall of Fame football player. It was actually at the birthday party

452
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:27,080
Another famous Hall of Fame football player and he actually made a speech and what he said in his speech was

453
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,000
Really significant and profound. He said that he has been his entire life

454
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,600
Trying not to make any waves

455
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,600
You know trying to appease to the status quo and

456
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:47,720
Although he had achieved greatness in football and looking back at his life

457
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,160
He wished at the time that he had

458
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,080
Command of the spotlight and all eyes were on him that he also

459
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,520
would have said some things and done some things

460
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,640
That I will they would have called some waves

461
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,880
They may have made a difference in the lives of his people and in society

462
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,160
And what that being said and it's stuff with me and I I really applaud him having

463
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,760
You know the the courage to even say that but what that being said

464
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
The power of

465
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
blogging

466
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,560
We'll look back at it and it is a paradigm shift and unprecedented and

467
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,880
To be able to utilize a blogging to help further change

468
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
peace

469
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
to help

470
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,440
Fight against injustices and things like that. I

471
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,560
Want to be able to look back at all the blogs

472
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I will do

473
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,400
And years to come and say that not only that we have fun with baseball and life and

474
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Family and God

475
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,320
But also when some things needed to be addressed and needed to be said

476
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,240
That MC Hammer stood up and said them and

477
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
With that being said

478
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I invite your comments

479
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
On history I won't give up on my life

480
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,480
Because I respect the comments and your thoughts

481
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,440

486
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,480
Ha ha all right MC MC Hammer or just say hammer. I think what is he back to MC Hammer is this name Stanley?

487
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,320
I don't give a shit dude. We're right across the bay right across from Oak Town

488
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,880
Let me know. I'll drive Trinity up. We'll hang out

489
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,720
We'll pop some bottles. We'll make some plans. We'll save the world my brother

490
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,240
Welcome back to the Bank of America Stadium here in beautiful Charlotte North Carolina

491
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,760
Skip the details old Kirk here along with Sami slim gym McCoy

495
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:31,080
What an amazing Taco Bell moment and the incredible must see TV second quarter by the bias and the toastinos two point are also made the

496
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,960
Remington close shave play of the energizer first half

497
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,640
I can only hope that the dirt cell third quarter kicks off as exciting a McDonald's second half is the toastinos two pointer

498
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,760
Fitter's the must see TV second quarter of the energizer first half. I couldn't agree more

499
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,680
Skip and who looks like we need to wrap up the bull's ball half done report as the players are taking the ruffles turf here at Bank of America

500
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,080
Stadium to start the dirt cell Macy's McDonald's second half brought to you by Honda

501
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:01,720
Honda's 2006 accord hybrid more power less gas Johnson said to deal from the texipo diesel

502
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,160
Season that's the national comment podcast. I actually if you subscribe to the pod finder, which I think

503
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,800
I don't know if it kind of will release it today, right? Maybe we'll release it Tuesday. I'm not sure

504
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:20,680
I put that one in actually Chris McIntyre put that one into the into the pod finder episode number 17 just cracked me out

505
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,920
But I think it's actually broadcast on terrestrial radio, but they make this available as podcast and like yep, that's the mainstream media for you

506
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,280
And the amazing Kevin says hey Adam, I was just listening to the chart of this morning three four four and all about your chord case

507
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,680
What boggles me is it seems is the amount of celebrity you possess over there and you're up mind you

508
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,040
I live in Florida and I'm 35 so I'd recognize you if you walked down the street just from MTV in the afternoon

509
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,080
I didn't even remember your stint on head bangers ball Ricky Rackman occupies that space in my head for me

510
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,240
Hmm, I can see that you have a certain amount of celebrity even here, but I don't see enough to warrant

511
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,600
Abloid coverage this is what I don't understand unless Europe holds your past televised accomplishments and current

512
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Untelivized and much bigger regard than America

513
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,480
Perhaps it's not necessarily you was Patricia celebrity or former celebrity that I'm unaware of

514
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,560
I'll be know her as your wife mother of your child on the occasional coho so help me out

515
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,960
Oh help a brother out here. I'm completely clueless now don't think I'm slamming you

516
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Okay, I understand

517
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,320
Absolutely Kevin. Yeah, I should explain Patricia is

518
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,400
He's a little bit older than I am. I'm 41. I'll be 42 this year and should be 57 this year

519
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,280
She's currently 56 and she started her musical career in the Netherlands with a Dutch language-based hit very important

520
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,320
when she was 16 so that was 1834 and

521
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,960
She was just an amazing overnight celebrity success

522
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,800
And the Netherlands very very small country. I think they're probably only 11 million people living in the country at the time

523
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
And they are really constricted

524
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,760
Not by borders because they you know that borders on well if you cross the water on the United Kingdom

525
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,400
Belgium France Germany if you go up high enough Scandinavia, but by language

526
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,440
The only other place in the earth where Dutch is is a spoken language is well two places

527
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,040
There's a there's kind of a version of an in Belgium which would be flenish and there's a version of it in South Africa

528
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,000
Which would be South Africaans and all of us can understand each other, but it's it's definitely dialect

529
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,560
Then within the country itself there's huge dialect differences

530
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,120
So that's why

531
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,040
Local celebrities, you know really kick around a lot particularly for years up until the

532
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,040
Man up until the early 90s they only had two television stations

533
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,600
Two all government run radio stations with the same and then they opened that up and

534
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,160
Well, you know all the so my wife was just well known throughout when we

535
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,400
Hooked up so to speak in my space talk and we hooked up in

536
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,320
1982 no later than that. I'm sorry 1980

537
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,760
Should I don't know mid 80s mid 80s

538
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,920
She was still married so she was of course that we talked about that yesterday and I was on television and so it was like

539
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,960
It was like a perfect thing a perfect scandal to famous people age differences height differences all kinds of differences

540
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,000
And people just love that shit and when you have a very small country you need you know to sell magazines

541
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,800
Particularly if you got 10 15 of them now we have 15 commercial television stations same with radio

542
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,520
You can't just fill it up with stuff that you buy from entertainment tonight people want to know about local celebrities

543
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,520
We just don't have that many and it's a lot of them actually get created that probably don't deserve to be on television

544
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
But that happens everywhere these days and

545
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,520
What was amazing is even though we live in the US together for 14 years and rarely went back to the Netherlands

546
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,520
When we came back we found that our celebrity was still as large as ever

547
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
And we did what most celebrities do we

548
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,200
We tried to turn that to our advantage instead of running away from it and that of course

549
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,640
But gets only more and that's really one of the reasons why we left a year almost a year and a half ago is we're tired of it

550
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,880
You know, so we just want to come here and hang out and

551
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,840
They got our address and started publishing pictures of our house and well the rest of course

552
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,920
You know by now so that's what's going on there

553
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,920
But I would have to say that really it is Patricia who is the celebrity she has

554
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,400
Real credibility she has an amazing amazing bunch of different talents

555
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,360
She's done duets with everyone from

556
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Tony Bennett to

557
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:37,240
Joan jet, I shouldn't do it with Joan jet. She was on Joan jet's album. She's been on you know all kinds of really hard rock albums

558
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
used to do those with the

559
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,840
Was it Babylon AD and stuff like that did those with the panties

560
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,840
And she's had her own TV show. She's been in these you know in the the European song contest

561
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,720
She's you know she's from the old school music business

562
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,560
Of the really 60s seven these and 80s and even in the 90s and she's also beautiful

563
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,680
Google Patricia pie and you'll see one of the

564
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,040
Four times she was featured in playboy magazine

565
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,400
The last time being when she was 50 and when you see it you'll say shit. Okay. I get it

566
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Just briefly a couple things before I check out it here for today

567
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
Ricky Jervais the

568
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,880
Pay per play from audible and iTunes

569
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,080
Is apparently already available on bit torrent

570
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,160
That's kind of disappointing. I wish that the people would have respected

571
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,040
Respected that when I got a presumed that it's only a few people who are ripping it off but I hope that

572
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,800
The Ricky Jervais show will be just as forthcoming with the success of their show behind

573
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,680
The DRM firewall

574
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
As it is

575
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,720
As they were you know for their Guinness Book of World Records entry. I hope oh

576
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:57,080
And then a beautiful email from Laura clap Adam heard a rumor you played a little tune of mine on your kickass podcast

577
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,560
It made my universe. I would be all snazzy and send you some sort of audio. Thank you as per Matthew evil suggestion

578
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:09,080
But I'm still learning this whole podcasting thing bear with me. Oh, and thank you. I probably should have mentioned that first

579
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,400
I would come to Gilford in a heartbeat by the way. Oh, she did listen to the show didn't she?

580
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,680
I'm from Gilford Connecticut. So perhaps it would feel a bit like home

581
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,600
slightly colder and less yuppies but home like nonetheless. Yeah, so I'll be in Germany at the Frankfurt

582
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,400
Music Mesa from the 27th of March through April 2nd Patricia has performed there

583
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,520
She told me this morning when I read your email tour come hang out and watch me demonstrate a cool little toy called voice live

584
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,480
Or send some pod love my way. I'm so new to all of this but Matt is slowly showing me the light

585
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,040
We're playing two shows in Kansas City this Friday and Saturday at Bar Natasha

586
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,480
As a matter of fact, it promises to be mayhem and wonderment

587
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:55,720
You are fucking swabulous and I am in awe of your kind words for hey hey sister, which I did write with a wonderful writer named

588
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,480
DeVinson Williams

589
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,200
Hope to hear from you soon major props to your wife who tells it like it is and probably keeps your ass in line. Uh-huh

590
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
You bet Laura

591
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,240
I'd really love that song. I'm gonna maybe apply that play it again on tomorrow show it was and Patricia

592
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
I were actually singing it this morning and

593
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,080
You know, I did make kind of a little faux pas shouldn't have said

594
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:23,640
Charlotte Charlotte church has a chunky ass. That wasn't very nice of me kind of a big fan of Charlotte church too actually

595
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,920
So pathetic and then finally one of the

596
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,120
The new pod show network podcasts is getting a lot of heat recently. I've been following the strip

597
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Which is the strippodcast.com

598
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,760
Let me see

599
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,840
On February 15th last Vegas more the this the strip podcast is about Vegas and it's

600
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,520
Produced in Vegas and there's a lot of shit going on in Vegas apparently

601
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:56,040
So on the 15th Steve win he's the big mogul in Vegas announced he was closing Avenue Q after nine months surprise move

602
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,480
But the strippodcast guys interviewed him

603
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,600
They have they have they're also reporters. I think Steve is a reporter so he wrote that for newsweek's website

604
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,080
But then

605
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,640
They post that a special edition about the interview in the strip there were a couple of big

606
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,200
Revelations in it including discussions of future plans for developing his property in Vegas

607
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,800
And all of a sudden this makes huge waves in the mainstream media

608
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,760
Local newspapers a grabbing up and basically this was a scoop from a podcast

609
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
New York post picked up the story and

610
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,480
Then they had these guys just keep going. This is really cool

611
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:43,240
In the in the episode after that of the strippodcast they had Las Vegas Congresswoman Shelley Berkeley on they asked her about her recent plastic surgery and

612
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,680
She went on at just a great length about her facelift last summer

613
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
But the story that took off

614
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,000
Check this through roll call the Capitol Hill newspaper

615
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,320
It did a big item on Monday because they noted and they compared the dates that she had skipped a vote on

616
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,280
Katrina relief in September

617
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,280
Because she was recovering from her surgery

618
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:12,920
So the strippodcast.com is definitely making some waves very proud to have them on the network and and creating all these scoops

619
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,840
They're showing up on like drug report and all kinds of crazy places so

620
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,880
Way to go guys. Hey, let's play one more pod save song before I get out of here, okay

621
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,280
I

622
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,280
Let me go, I'm not here to get a baby

623
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Give me help, I'm gonna wear the water past the tree

624
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,280
And it's time you look at me, I'm gonna feel guilty

625
