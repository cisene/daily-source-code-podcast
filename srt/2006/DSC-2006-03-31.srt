Delta Sierra Charlie 3-6-4

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I got it.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You may think they're benevolent or maybe even kind.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You may think they're the kind of guys who help you every time.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But show once you're now to enter in the fold.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Just sign up on the dotted line and let them have your soul.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The come track is simple.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's all in black and white.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Except for all that other stuff.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But you don't have to mind.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You needn't have to argue.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If you really feel abused,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you've signed away your life.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And now there's nothing you can do.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's the evil pod show that sunk you up and then they'll go.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Out the door and search it more.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Stupid suckers just like you.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You may say,

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Holy hay,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I've screwed myself and deep today.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But now it's done.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You cannot run.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's all too late.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You better sign it.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I won't sign it.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You better sign it.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I won't sign it.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You better sign it.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You can't make me sign it.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, I won't sign it.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:33,440
I know I won't, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:03:03,400
Hey everybody, thank god it's Friday this is the Daily Source Code, the last

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,680
one before my luxurious 10 day vacation, how you doing everybody, Jeff Smith, you are my hero

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,520
man, I love that, that was so fantastic, and the funny thing was, after Jeff sent that to me,

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,800
we talked about this for about a day or two, actually yeah for about two days, and he

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,600
sent this to me, and the funny thing was he said in his email, he said, hey dude, you don't

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,760
actually own the rights of this forever, do you?

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,680
Oh man, what a genius, genius talent, okay, well I'm going to try and make it a relatively

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,160
short show because we got to go, we got to get out of here, it is what's the time here,

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,360
it's 1130, and I told you I was doing all these different preparations to get out of here,

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,560
we're going to the old Garvin Portugal, what I didn't tell you is the journey that we

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,960
actually have to take to get there because not only was it almost impossible to find any hotel

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,080
rooms anywhere where the sunshine and Portugal I think today is about the expecting 24 to

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:08,280
25 degrees centigrade which is just right on the money for me, we couldn't get any flights

51
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,240
either, and you know the Delta Sierra, although a fine machine, it has limited bathroom

52
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,240
facilities for a trip that long because I don't know what is that, that's like 2,000 miles

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,360
or something to get from here to Portugal, so the only flights we could get is from Rotterdam

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,360
and that's tomorrow morning at like 7 a.m. so we had to decide, okay, how do we get from

55
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,560
here to Rotterdam, and of course I'm like oh yeah, oh yeah, we can fly the Delta Sierra

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,640
right down to Rotterdam and then well that wasn't till I started doing the weight and

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,360
balance, this is very critical if you're a pilot, when you're flying you have to, you

58
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,760
first of all know that you're not overweight because at a certain point the plane just

59
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,160
won't lift off the ground, and of course the balance is also important because if you're

60
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,480
too heavily frontloaded or backloaded you may not be able to, you might not just literally

61
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,400
have enough stick to take off or land either, so I started to do some calculations based

62
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,400
upon the suitcases, the girls are packed, we're driving, there's no way we're lifting off,

63
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,920
it's like forget about it, I didn't want to start limiting them on what they could

64
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,960
take and all that stuff so I said forget about it. What we're going to do something exciting

65
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,640
though, actually haven't done this yet, we're going to take the super V8 to Folkstone, that's

66
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,360
where the Euro Tunnel is, now the Euro Tunnel is this huge massive project that's been going

67
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,000
on for more than a decade and it's a tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, so you

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,600
go from Folkstone to Calais and you literally drive your car onto a train, it's a 30 minute,

69
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,120
35 minute train ride underneath the channel and then from Calais we'll drive up to Rotterdam,

70
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,600
so in total I think we'll probably be driving four or five hours, but we'll see some of the English

71
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,760
countryside we haven't seen yet, we'll actually, you know, it's the first real big trip that the

72
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,560
the Shagua, the Shagua will be going on, so hopefully it hangs together and we'll also see

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,960
some of the French countryside and it should be pretty nice and then we'll stay overnight in Rotterdam

74
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,240
and be at the airport right in early off the Portugal, and of course I'm sure that we'll land

75
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,400
so early that the hotel rooms won't be available and we'll be able to unpack and do any of that stuff,

76
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,880
but who cares? I'm glad we're going, I'm ready to unplug and unwind.

77
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,280
See, my brain is so fragile, I'm not only physically tired, I'm mentally tired.

78
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,400
In the meantime though, we've received a whole bunch of box, best of Charlie's,

79
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,920
Bravo Oscar Charlie's, we could use a couple more and P-Dub was going to be slinging those onto the

80
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,120
under the satellite in my absence, I think there's actually seven days that we'll have to have a

81
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,080
different show, or we'll have a best of show, and somehow I got to figure out how we get those

82
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,560
posted onto the Charlie feed as well, which is going to be interesting because the actual,

83
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,240
it's a whole long story, but God, I can't wait to migrate over to the, over to the pod show,

84
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,040
P-D-N where I can actually stack that stuff up and have it all automatic, so somehow I'm going

85
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,440
to have to figure out how to get those shows uploaded and we'll figure something else. I got to talk

86
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,080
to so many people, but maybe on my two-hour drive to Folkstone, I'll be able to get a hold of some

87
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,800
folks and set some of that stuff up, but thank you very much everyone who's been sending those in.

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,680
I don't have the list here, but I'll make sure to get you off some cool pod shows swag,

89
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,120
and we need about just need a couple more, so if you want to send one in, please feel free to

90
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,920
and we'll be happy to use that. Okay, I'm going to, as I said, I'm going to try and make a

91
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,760
short show today, but we have some interesting stuff that came in via audio comments.

92
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,640
Hey Adam, how you doing? This is Dave from the yoga pages podcast. You can find my podcast at the yogapages.com.

93
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,320
It's for yoga lovers around the world. We do yoga news, interviews, and product reviews.

94
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:12,600
The reason I'm contacting you is regarding the DGAP technology. I'm working on a second podcast now

95
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:22,840
that would kind of a for-profit model that would depend on using the DGAP technology, and I've,

96
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,120
you know, heard you with the GoDaddy thing and putting it into some of the podcast. What I don't

97
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:36,600
know is, is that available for everyone? Or is that just a pod show kind of an exclusive thing?

98
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,720
So if it is out there for all of us to use, can you point me in the right direction? I'd appreciate that

99
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,640
and keep up the good work with the Charlie time for me to check into today's episode

100
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,680
and see if I'm the Golden Ticket winner. Bye-bye. So yeah, that is kind of a, it is a pod show

101
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,120
technology that we've been, that what we've been thinking about it working on it for probably over a year now.

102
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Andrew Grummit did most of the technology K1, of course, did some stuff on that.

103
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,280
Well, the whole pod show team has been involved in it because it's never just one person that does this,

104
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,320
but Andrew has really been working on a lot of the logistics of it and the core got some

105
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,560
particularly on the Golden Ticket stuff, which really, people are very excited about this whole

106
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,560
idea and we're going to take, we can take this in so many directions. So drop me a line. Let me know

107
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,560
what your idea is and we'll be happy to see if we can help out. And if you have an idea that we can

108
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,680
test out, I'd love to do that too because the Golden Ticket is just one small step into the future of

109
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,240
what we can do with this stuff. So yesterday, we inserted yet another Golden Ticket chances were

110
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,960
one in 25,000. Those were your odds of receiving the ticket. It actually, the ticket was

111
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,560
issued quite early in the day. I think it was probably in the first couple thousand downloads. Again,

112
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,240
this is all random. So although your chances, your odds remain one in 25,000, that's the way it's set

113
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,840
up. It could have fallen at any time and so it was issued and Andrew and I were like,

114
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,120
okay, it's an issue because we still haven't heard from the first Golden Ticket winner,

115
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,480
which kind of makes, it also reset my brain a little bit about this stuff. And if you think about,

116
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,880
excuse me, I'm saying, if you think about how the five, Willy Wonka Golden Tickets worked,

117
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,480
it took several weeks, I guess. We're not in movie time, but in the story before all of them were

118
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,800
actually discovered. And you had all those kids eating all those thousands of chocolate bars, right?

119
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:48,360
So yesterday, I received this. Oh, my gosh. Oh, man, I want to, I can't believe it. So I'm

120
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,560
listening to your show and, you know, I'm kind of still bummed out from yesterday because I doubt

121
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,960
I don't want anything. And all of a sudden, you know, the sound goes away like mid-set and

122
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:07,080
saying, what, what's going on? What's down? System broke or what? And there you are. You're saying

123
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,320
congratulations, you won. And I'm thinking, what? Huh? I'm still dreaming. No, I'm still dreaming. You

124
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,440
know, I should, I should have slept like 14 hours straight because I haven't slept in a while.

125
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,000
And I'm thinking, I must be like, you know, how you get a dream within a dream?

126
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:31,080
So, I'm thinking I'm still dreaming. Anyway, dude. So what, you're going to call me? That's

127
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,680
going to be a trip. Okay. Cool. Hey, you know, I should probably promote my show.

128
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,400
Get some listeners to that. It's a different world podcast and get it on iTunes. Or you can go to

129
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,520
music.potcho.com, do a search for it's different world. Don't put in the

130
00:11:50,520 --> 00:12:01,800
comments. You won't find it. And check my show out. Oh, man. All right. Woo. Wait a minute.

131
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,440
I don't have an iPod. Oh, I won. Woo.

132
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:46,600
All right, this is okay. Can it's out. I'm curry. Oh. How are you doing? Good. Is this what you're going to do?

133
00:12:47,240 --> 00:13:00,120
Dude, give me the phrase that pays. Oh. Oh, man. I'm actually talking to Adam Curry.

134
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Dude, congratulations on being our first golden ticket winner. Thank you. Thank you.

135
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,760
Yeah, it was the other guy's first things all in, I think. No, you're the first one to dial in. Of course,

136
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,440
there's one more golden ticket out there floating around somewhere. And as I promise, if that person

137
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,440
picks up the ticket, then they'll win too. But I was so excited when I got your message. They,

138
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,960
you know, like, we were all jumping up and down and everyone in the office was excited because it

139
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:35,560
worked. Dude, it's not working. Yeah, that's not working. It's almost scary. You could almost take it to

140
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,840
another step and actually target people. I think maybe possibly. I don't know. Yeah, that would be

141
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,360
so evil. We don't want to do that. This was all for the fun. I was actually pretty happy that,

142
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,440
you know, you hadn't figured some way to hack it out or whatever to figure it out. You just,

143
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,120
now, if I, if you, are you in the Bay areas that where you are? Yeah, yeah, I'm in San Mateo.

144
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,240
Yeah, because we could see from the logs, we could see that it was from the Bay area and your

145
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,800
Mac user and you have iTunes for your podcast, right? That's right. Now, that's a evil that we know

146
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:15,160
that shit. You know, that's what, but yeah. So dude, I think I didn't want this like Bay of Girls

147
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,640
crying. I was hoping I can get through the call without something happening. That's okay. How many girls do you

148
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:27,800
have? I have a little girl she is wishing 19 months now and a little boy he's for your goal.

149
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,360
Oh, bless you. They sound really excited about the whole golden ticket concept, too, don't they?

150
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Yeah, I couldn't really say, but yeah, I'm glad it worked. So Ken, from your message I understood

151
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:48,440
you don't have an iPod? No, I don't. So that remote won't do you much good then, I guess.

152
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,760
No, that's not like that's it. Don't worry about it, man. That's a shit that never makes it

153
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,920
onto the radio. This is real. This is real life. You know, people have kids and they, they don't

154
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,680
cooperate. It's great. Now listen, Ken, we're so excited about this and I know you don't have an iPod.

155
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,680
So instead of the the the remote, which we will give away in a future goal and take it,

156
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm going to send you an iPod, okay? Of course, man, this is historic as far as I'm concerned.

157
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,240
We've done something really cool. I want you to be happy about it. Not sitting around with a

158
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:35,080
phone. Oh, man. I didn't listen to your show on the computer and if I don't do that,

159
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,920
I actually downloaded onto a memory card sticking in my phone and I listened to it while I

160
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,560
got my way to work or something. Oh, fabulous. Oh, I don't have to do that anymore. Oh, wow.

161
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,360
Well, listen, Ken, I'll let you get back to the family. I've got to see, I have your address, I think.

162
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,560
If not, do I have your address, did you email that to me?

163
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:05,000
Please tell me when we're done. Email me. I love this. Email me, your address and I'll get

164
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,560
an iPod out to you in some pod show slide. Okay, you know, just like five minutes ago,

165
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,360
they're running around laughing, having a great time and working broadcasting, working radio,

166
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,800
working podcasting. It's all the same time. That's perfect, man. I love it. Listen, we're just

167
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,800
really excited that it worked and really appreciate you helping out in the test. Oh, man.

168
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,400
And I'm glad it's going. Now you have your podcast. You want to talk about that for a second.

169
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,160
Give it a plug? Yeah. Yeah. My podcast is called, it's a different world.

170
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,080
If I talk about gadgets, I talk about news that will be now. It's quiet. What's that?

171
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,880
Talking sound. I know I talk about, you know, the new gadgets out. I basically introduce

172
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,080
you know, the stuff to people. So, you know, people might not be tuned into, you know,

173
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,960
what's new and what's going on and they probably don't care. But, you know, they listen,

174
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,160
my show, just get a, get a heads off on what's going on. And what's up? See you,

175
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,600
we're all. You can go to my website, but it's probably better that you go to

176
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,440
music.potshow.com. And type in. Now give me your website, man. Give me your website.

177
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,000
What's it? It's a different world.com. It's a different world.com. You know what? I was listening to that

178
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,960
thing. I was listening to your, to the, to the, to the message you sent in a Patricia walked in.

179
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,240
Well, I was, I was, I'll cueing that. You said, yeah, he has a really good voice.

180
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:35,400
Oh, man. Yeah. What the mic. I hear you. Where do you think these go on is from?

181
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,640
Man, from the microphone, from the PR 40.

182
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:47,480
Oh, I'm nothing without the mic. But yeah. All right. Can, well, listen, when I'm in San Francisco,

183
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,160
maybe I don't know West Coast, we can hook up sometime. And in the meantime, I'll make sure you get

184
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,040
a nice little package, including an iPod and some t-shirts and stuff. And once again, thank you

185
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,040
very much for participating and staying subscribed to the show. I sure will. And I'll tell everybody.

186
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,040
All right, buddy. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Have yourself, have yourself a great,

187
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,280
great evening or great day and, uh, we'll, uh, we'll get stuff off to you and we'll hook up for a

188
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:19,080
cup of coffee one day. Oh, that's a good cool. That's cool. All right. Hi, everybody. This is Andy from the

189
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,200
polar bear podcast. Now, I've noticed that people have some really strange ideas about my home

190
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,320
come through Sweden. So I thought a straighter things out a bit and killed some of those myths

191
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,600
you might have heard. But that's not all I do on the polar bear podcast. I also deliver some

192
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,280
strange and design news from over here and give you an idea how odd people sometimes behave

193
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,200
in this country. And then of course, I have a little music review section. Sometimes I do interviews

194
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,120
without coming artists who I think to serve a little more extra airtime. Anyway, if you're curious

195
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,880
about the exotic life in Sweden, you should definitely check out the polar bear podcast. Subscribe

196
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,440
through iTunes or on the website at polar bearpodcast.com. Now let's get back to the show again.

197
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:13,960
So this is Andy, signing off. I had another straight writer over at Rutgers Ramlin's podcast.

198
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,880
The podcast that features entertainment, politics, and pop culture all in one half hour show.

199
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,800
Now some of our recent topics have been the war on terror, the war on Christmas, and the war on

200
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,480
Hillary Clinton, which my opinion has been a very good war. And so I also liked to balance that

201
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,000
off with some entertainment news and pop culture items. I've talked about one of the 80s TV shows

202
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,920
called WizKids and also one of my favorite television shows that I was personally involved in

203
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:49,480
Babylon 5. And I've recently begun using a piece of software that you know gas blaster and get

204
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:56,360
hang of it and really like it. So once again, please check me out at RutgersRamlin's.com. That's

205
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:12,280
our UTT-ERS Ramlin's.com.

206
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:24,040
Hi, I'm Ninja, the host of the Hot Fossils in Rubble Matter Show. I give you 15 give or take minutes of

207
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,840
fun-filled observations, commentary, reviews, performance pieces, and sometimes interviews.

208
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:40,120
Sometimes serious, sometimes not, sometimes hot. I invite you to try it out. That's the Hot Fossils

209
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:54,280
and Rubble Matter Show at HotFRM.lognatrix.com. I'm also listed on www.qpater.org. Give it a try.

210
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,640
I'd love to spend some time with you.

211
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,280
Got me, yeah, I've been. Love to spend some time with you, too. Hold on a second. Damn.

212
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,920
Sometimes these audio comments are just so soft and volume. It's impossible to get them all right.

213
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:19,480
Okay, there you go. So I was pretty happy with the results of our golden ticket and we're going

214
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,160
to start thinking about more ways to utilize this and we'll probably do some more testing. If you

215
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,640
got any ideas, let me know. It's always fun to try new stuff out. And I was also pretty happy with

216
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,560
the Skype call. That kind of worked, too. Here our dog is really happy. We're leaving. He's barking

217
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,600
all day. Our little dog is a little Yorkshire last night. We were looking for him. We couldn't find him.

218
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,880
He was actually in the suitcase. In the suitcase. I'm coming with you guys, right? We've never been

219
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,680
away from him for 10 days. We can't take him with us because if you leave the country, then it's

220
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,160
another six months and all kinds of blood tests and crap before you can bring a dog back in.

221
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,120
So poor little survivor. I was going to actually try to get another Skype call going because I

222
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:15,960
finally got a real conversation going with Brad Zutout from Pod to Mob. It started off on, you know,

223
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,440
we finally just connected on him. I don't know. I think that he didn't receive some of my emails.

224
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,640
I mean, that's completely possible. Whatever happened there. That's, you know, how that should

225
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,280
go with the communications these days with busy people. But we did have a pretty good dialogue on

226
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,000
on the email and I said, you know, dude, we got to come on the show. Let's talk about this stuff.

227
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,600
And Brad, of course, agreed now. He's in out on the west coast and he has some personal

228
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,520
shit going on. Some of his is ill. So, you know, he couldn't, he couldn't get to a phone or a

229
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,240
Skype or anything when I want to do it to yesterday. And of course, because of the nine hour

230
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:02,200
time difference is just not going to work out. We really wanted to get this going now. But it just

231
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,760
unfortunately just didn't work out. But I have to say that after, after some, some back and forth

232
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,640
on the email, I don't think these guys are evil. I think that actually, I think that they're very

233
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,800
very enthusiastic. Have some pretty good ideas. I'd actually like to try and, I mean, this is,

234
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,280
this is how I started out with him. The first email I sent was, okay, you know, maybe we can work

235
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,000
together, maybe something we can do. And then after I didn't hear back, I started to get pretty

236
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,400
huffy. And he's, I got to say, he seems like a pretty cool guy. And he says that they actually

237
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,680
started the whole project because they were fans of the Charlie and a couple other shows and

238
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,480
they just wanted to be able to hear it on their cell phones. And I said, okay, look, then

239
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,840
put me back in the directory, make me available again, the daily source code, but don't insert

240
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,760
any ads. You could certainly say, you know, this, you're hearing this podcast, thanks to

241
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,880
Pod to Mob technology or whatever, I'm all fine with that. And then when I get back, we'll continue

242
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,880
the conversation. I think, you know, he may still be thinking a little bit differently from,

243
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,680
from the way we're thinking, but at least we can have a real grown-up conversation about it.

244
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:20,520
So I'm very, very happy. And I'm sorry I'm going away. I just, I, I really can't get into this

245
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,360
in the next 10 days. So I'm going to hang back and think that, you know, we'll actually,

246
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,760
we'll actually be able to work some cool stuff out and get everyone on the same page here.

247
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:37,080
Those of you checking us out on Syria stars 102, you'll be hearing best of Charlie's, I guess,

248
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,040
for for the next week and a half. And of course, PCH is up next. You guys have a great weekend,

249
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,440
and then I'll see it in about two weeks. And those of you still listen to the podcast.

250
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,800
Let me just continue with that Pod to Mob. So anyway, maybe this maybe Brad just isn't a great

251
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:02,120
communicator on the boards and stuff like that, but on email he's saying he seemed okay. So

252
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm going to neutralize my, my feelings. And when I get back, hopefully we'll have a longer

253
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,680
conversation. And in the meantime, I just have to say from everything that I've received and

254
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,680
the communication I've had, they don't see me, well, they seem very enthusiastic. And I think that we,

255
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,160
we actually might be able to get something really good out of this. Because at the end of the day,

256
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,320
I have received emails from people who, who actually said, you know, dude, we, we really

257
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,920
use that stuff. We can't receive podcasts here in the office because the, the network is,

258
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,680
doesn't allow, you know, MP3s and huge downloads and stuff like that. So it's been kind of a

259
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,080
a way to get to the shows anyway. So we don't want a lot of people out. We just want to make sure that we

260
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:50,520
have an agreement over, you know, who, who can do what to, to what stuff. So looking forward to.

261
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:10,280
Yeah. And curious, Metro's sexual moment. Just wanted to say that we will, of course,

262
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,560
be giving away the key span AV dock for the iPod and the AV RF remote. I'm going to send that

263
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,560
off to to can as well, along with his iPod. And if the first golden ticket is actually discovered,

264
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,880
well, we still have that key span AV dock for the iPod and the AV RF remote. For you,

265
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,960
if you discover that golden ticket, be the, the ticket was issued to someone using a juice receiver

266
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,160
by the way. So if you're using juice, you might want to check it and see, see if there's a little

267
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:45,560
present for you. It's the Metro sexual moment. This is where we, this is where we throw down

268
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,720
the guys, you know, we talk about guy stuff that we're kind of embarrassed to talk about face to face

269
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,440
around the water cooler and you know what's really cool? The chicks are checking it. Hi Adam,

270
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,480
this is a great team with a comment or the Metro sexual moment. You talked about getting rid of

271
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,960
body here lately, but I feel you've left out in areas that's kind of important. Don't stop

272
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,080
it's another region while you're grooming. Take a trip on us, can't on and visit the underarms too.

273
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,480
That hair traps oil, dirt, sweat, and germs, leading not just something pretty gross to look at.

274
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,160
But to some pretty serious challenges, the modern theater technology as well. Women generally have

275
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,800
a fairly sensitive sense of smell. So there's something nice for us. Maybe we'll do something nice

276
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,400
for you. That's the first time I've heard a woman say take a trip up town. I agree.

277
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,960
And you know what I usually use for that? I usually steal my wife's lady shave and just kind of

278
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,520
just kind of sip away there because you're right. It is a sweat trap. And indeed, modern

279
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,400
theater technology has a hard time with that. By the way, I'm using acts these days because

280
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:58,760
you know, it gives you all the chicks, right? Yo, Adam. Trucker Tom here. Voiding dry skin seems to be

281
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,800
a major Metro sexual moment, topic of choice. I'm a big believer in the power of proper nutrition.

282
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,800
I've void dry skin by taking something called essential fatty acid nutritional supplements.

283
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,480
And this made a huge difference. If one has dry crack skin or even occasional tang nails,

284
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:25,400
one has an essential fatty acid deficiency. Chronic dry crack skin problems can be cured in about

285
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,560
two weeks with the daily dose of essential fatty acid nutritional supplements. And keep this in mind

286
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,520
if your skin is cracking on the outside, something is likely cracking on the inside as well.

287
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,840
Here's a testimony to our podcasting in the internet. A truck driver that I'd never met

288
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,840
before came and knocked on my trucks door shortly after I parked in a small Ohio truck stop a few

289
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:55,480
days ago. He not only knew my name, but he knew a lot about me because he had listened to most of

290
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,280
my podcasts and seen my pictures and video podcasts on the internet. Is a video version of

291
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,360
Casplaster possible? The answer is yes. There's an existing piece of video editing software

292
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:15,000
that's been around a few years called serious magic visual communicator. And that's at seriousmagic.com.

293
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:22,600
It enables real-time video recording to wind us PC in the style of the newscast with the timeline

294
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,480
and the integrated teleprompter. It's possible to integrate audio, video, and still image files

295
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:39,480
into the timeline as you record video in real time from a camera. You can find me at truckartom.pocho.com

296
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:47,960
and truckartphoto.com. I can't say tailwind since I'm a truck driver and not a pilot. However,

297
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:56,040
I can say biowinds or tailpipe. That would work too. Trucker Tom, thank you very much, dude.

298
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,280
By the way, on the Casplaster video, a Casplaster mic really is working on that. He's got ideas. He's

299
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,080
off, he's been programming all week in his little cottage. If you listen to the daily breakfast,

300
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,120
we're father Roderick interviewed him. And thank you very much for chatting. You know what's

301
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,360
frequently out as you talked about, if your skin's cracking on the outside, just imagine what's cracking

302
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:23,560
on the inside. Oh, man. Yes, this and many more handy tips. On the daily source codes,

303
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:32,840
heterosexual moment. Hi Adam, this is American Matt from the wannabe podcast of for God and

304
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:39,400
Country. And I've been following the conversation about contracts. Now, I am not an attorney,

305
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,400
nor do I play one on TV, but I am a law student and I have had contracts. And I think part of the

306
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,960
problem here is that people are fearful of what they don't understand. And what people don't get

307
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,880
is that a contract is just a starting point. When an organization like yours sends someone

308
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,280
a contract, of course, it's going to be a wrote form contract to save you guys a lot of trouble.

309
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,240
And you kind of know the base point where you want to start. But people don't get that this is just

310
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,200
an offer. And then from there, the conversation opens up. They read it. They say what they like.

311
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,920
They say what they don't like. They say what's missing. And a conversation happens and a relationship

312
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,880
is established and ultimately through a negotiation process, they have the freedom to change

313
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,120
the contract around. See, if you guys can come up to something that works for everyone,

314
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,840
or not. And I'm a think that part of the problem is people seem to think that because you're the

315
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,920
pod father, you're the god father. And what you say goes and that contract is it, it's wrote,

316
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,640
it's written in blood and they've got to sign their solo way. Which, well, I don't know about the whole

317
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,400
signing away of the soul. I've heard a few things. But it would just thought I'd like to clarify

318
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:54,040
for some of your listeners that contracts are never written in stone. Even God knew that because

319
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,400
Moses broke that one. Have a great day. Bye. All right. Just one one misconception. I want to

320
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:06,600
clear up about that. Oh, man. All this writing on the internet. A contract does not. I repeat

321
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,800
does not state we own your stuff. Okay. And just doesn't say that. Whatever interpretation you

322
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:18,120
hear from anyone, it's not what it says. All right. I got to get off. I got to get out. I got to get off.

323
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,600
Yeah. I got to get off too. But I also have to get out of here. And I want to leave you with a song

324
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,400
that I've played before that I really, I really like this band. I love this song just to death.

325
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,680
It's a relatively new on the pod safe music network. And what's interesting about this is

326
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,200
I was setting up Patricia's computer downstairs so she could listen to my shows when I'm

327
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,160
in San Francisco because it turns out she doesn't listen because it's not it's intimidating

328
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,560
to her. So I like that because a lot of the stuff that we're developing that we're going to be

329
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:56,120
releasing just about a couple days after I get back from from holidays is going to solve all that.

330
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,960
It's going to take away the intimidation factor. Make it much easier for you to listen to podcasts.

331
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,560
Remember, we're about listeners primarily. Yes, lots of good tools and stuff for podcasts.

332
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,440
But we've really focused a hell of a lot of attention on making the listening and discovery

333
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,160
experience much, much better and the interaction with the podcast. So that's pod show applause and you'll

334
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,800
see that around the same time frame. We're trying to get it just in time for tax day, April 15th.

335
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:27,160
And Christina was looking over our shoulder and up in the dashboard popped up the show and it's

336
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,800
and started playing and Christina was looking at the show notes. She said, thank oh Jones. I know them.

337
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,640
Said really. She said, yeah, yeah, I've known for them. I know about them for like five six

338
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,560
months. I love them. And then she immediately went back to her own computer and emailed me two

339
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,760
tracks that she's that she had. So now I know I'm on to something. And you hear a lot about, you know,

340
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,200
the the big success of my space is Arctic monkeys. It's like is the same thing at the Guardian Media

341
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,800
Conference. That's all that seems like the only thing that can talk about is someone broke out and

342
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,040
and now is successful for thanks to my space. Well, I think we're going to see a lot more of success

343
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:06,280
like that. And I think that these guys, these guys could be one of the next big smash hits coming

344
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:17,320
out of the pot safe music scene. Dango Jones. First day. Oh, you might want to crank it up because it's

345
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:27,080
ready. First date. Electricity. When you walk in, you see my circuit tree. Back it up. We

346
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:33,800
out of two. When people swear that out, you always play cool. I think I know you. I'm going

347
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:42,200
to make you look super junk and don't get your quick fix. In my car, you've got a sweet tooth and

348
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,280

The catwalk, I like to play it to squid

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,280
You won't be wanna show, spray paint your

So take a chance, give me a shot

355
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,380
You think I'm bluffing, I think I'm not

Get on your hideeal, give me a heart attack

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,280
Do your kiss of a first name

362
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,980
Do your kiss of a first name

363
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

365
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:18,660
Oh, danko Jones, if you're a WrestleMania fan this weekend according to CC Chapman from

366
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,780
accident hash, one of danko's songs is going to play over the opening credits of WrestleMania.

367
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,460
So congratulations to the guys and I hope you have that kind of first date tonight, a good

368
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,460
one.

369
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
I'm going out on the town.

370
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,460
I'm really going to try and stay away from the podcast.

371
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,460
I have a feeling that somewhere made a week, we might do some kind of video thing just

372
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,860
to show you that we're having a good time and to check in.

373
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:48,580
It's very, very, very hard for me to unwaan, but I plan on spending a lot of fun time

374
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
with the girls.

375
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:54,420
Swimming, sun, surf, maybe I'll even try some golf, that seems to be what everyone does

376
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,060
in Portugal.

377
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,180
So, of course, I'd like to check in every single day with Gmail to delete stuff, so

378
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,780
that stuff doesn't start bouncing.

379
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,780
Hey, everybody, where's my, where's my lighter?

380
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Now here it is.

381
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,980
Hey, thank you very much for, for checking us out, stay subscribed because eventually

382
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,660
stuff will just show up automatically.

383
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,220

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,020
