It'll stay.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Be careful.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello, my dear.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good fall.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Am I Muslim?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Look at your pancakes.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good night, Ken.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Could there be any thicker and bigger?

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You want thick and big, baby?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It came to the right place.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hold on.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, what?

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sounds good.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay.

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, you wanted it.

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But people listening.

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You asked for it.

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You've got Adam and Patricia on the road.

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We are in New York.

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah.

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Just woke off.

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes.

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it's Monday morning.

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's going to be busy day for me.

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why don't we have to alternate this?

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Because only one of us can talk and one of us can eat at the same time.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, I can eat in talk.

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you have a proper?

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What do you have on?

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What is your own?

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I have a very healthy of course.

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Of course.

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Because I want to live a little bit longer.

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They're me.

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Trying to catch up to me.

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Can't catch up.

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They're not leaving any syrup with those.

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, they did.

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah.

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Where's the glasses, son?

51
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes, I'm right.

52
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Guess I'm right.

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Not done.

54
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I have a mushy, which fruit in New York.

55
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, so that's cold.

56
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

57
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, good.

58
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And you have...

59
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But of no pancakes, thick, thick, creamy, juicy, nasty ass pan.

60
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Can't get them anywhere else.

61
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Not you on your ass pancakes.

62
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't get them anywhere else, but in America.

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Not like that.

64
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Not like this.

65
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

66
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They look like sort of a pound of puffs.

67
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's how big they are.

68
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So we started our trip Saturday.

69
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Right?

70
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah.

71
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Saturday coming from London to New York.

72
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're going to be here.

73
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
As it turns out, now a little bit longer than we expected.

74
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We're going to be here through Wednesday.

75
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wednesday was flying to the West Coast.

76
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How is your flight over dear?

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The wonderful Virgin Atlantic Express Upper Class Extrasigalza.

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That was very cool.

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That was very good.

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's relaxing.

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And you can lean down a little bit in your best-top of whatever it is.

82
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It looks like a best-top.

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're a special little bathtub.

84
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah.

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So it's nice.

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's nice actually to stretch your legs.

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And you feel much better when you come out.

89
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And okay.

91
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So actually, because of the air pressure and the pressure sometimes bothers you.

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We didn't have any problem, right?

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No, I do.

94
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No problem this time.

95
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

96
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

97
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So arrive in New York at the fantastic W hotel.

98
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
On time square.

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now if you don't know the W hotel, it is what we would consider to be a boaty hotel.

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, they say, no, no, because they have more of those hotels.

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And you explain to me then it isn't a boutique hotel.

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But it looks like a boutique hotel.

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That means that it's very trendy.

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Non-traditional.

105
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let me call this non-traditional.

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I hate it.

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm a traditional girl.

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
She's giving me a normal bathroom with a bath stop or anything.

109
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But then this Chinese, what is it?

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Japanese.

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, it's a lot, there's a lot of black.

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A lot of chrome.

114
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Grey, chrome, black.

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The nightstands look like a nice cube.

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, it actually looks like the Apple cube computer.

117
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A nice cube.

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A nice cube that lights up in the, when you want some light and anything.

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's contemporary.

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Look at the refrigerator.

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
On top of, I don't know what it is.

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yep.

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, instead of a nice mini bar that's built into a cabin.

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's actually just sitting on top of a thing.

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I just don't get it.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I just don't get what the excitement is about rooms like this.

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, it's, I don't know.

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It is not cozy.

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Not at all.

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's impossible to put your stuff away from home.

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't you want that when you are traveling.

136
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I want that.

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want that.

138
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There are many people who don't have a nice, I mean, this is nice.

139
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I mean, it's not, it's not a bad hotel.

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm just, you know, you've got to love the consistent house music.

141
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Quite prop a whole place.

142
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Not being able to see in the hallways of the elevator because the lighting is so thin.

144
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
To hide, of course, the crap.

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, because if you, if you really, you know, look very carefully.

146
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In the bathroom, you see that it is, it looks shitty.

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Mm-hmm.

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It looks really shitty.

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, yeah.

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You cannot get rid of your stuff.

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You don't know where to put it.

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No, no place to put it.

153
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No.

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No shelves.

155
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There's no shelves.

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But it's a really cool looking wash basin.

157
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's round.

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

159
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You can't even put your soap on it.

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Just glide it off.

161
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And, yeah.

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So I don't get it.

163
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So that was the hotel.

164
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's a piece of it.

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think it's a piece of shit.

166
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Just like that.

168
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have no other explanation.

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No explanation for it.

170
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No other explanation.

171
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I hate it.

172
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But it's nice to hear.

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Would you please don't hold back on?

174
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No, I don't.

175
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No, no, no.

176
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So before we get to today in tomorrow, it's a Ron and Marta are here as well.

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ron and I have a whole bunch of stuff to do.

178
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Way too much to do in two days.

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, here in New York.

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, at yesterday, actually, we went out for, so we were up very early.

181
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We woke up at like four, four, thirty in the morning.

182
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then we had already had breakfast by, shoot, seven, thirty.

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And then we went out walking.

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

186
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
A beautiful day yesterday.

187
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We walked all the way up for Central Park West.

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, we were looking for it.

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
When we first moved to New York, we stayed for a month at the Mayflower cell.

190
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah.

191
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And it was gone.

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's gone.

193
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It doesn't exist anymore.

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Everything is changed.

195
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Columbus Circle has changed.

196
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Because that was where we used to live.

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, that was the 50s and Broadway.

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That was where we arrived here.

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In 1987.

200
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah.

201
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

202
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And it was nice to look at the windows of the Central Park.

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And it was overwhelming.

204
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
All this building around the buildings around it.

205
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

206
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was 1987.

207
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We're talking about just yesterday.

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And now, it was just gone.

209
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It was really gone.

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Beautiful buildings actually next to it.

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And we were looking for the Dakota.

212
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We couldn't recognize them.

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No.

214
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know for some reason.

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean, it's seventy-second stream.

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah.

217
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And it just...

218
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I remember it being more impressive on the outside last time I looked at it.

219
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But then you hung it right into a strawberry fields.

220
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Was you never seen?

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mm-hmm.

222
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Wow.

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It was a nice feeling.

224
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But it didn't look like a strawberry field.

225
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No.

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I thought...

227
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I wouldn't...

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You really thought it was a strawberry.

229
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Did you really believe it?

230
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, maybe something pink or red.

231
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No, just a thing in the middle that says a man.

232
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No.

233
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's sort of concrete, concrete thing.

234
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hmm.

235
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like a mosaic.

236
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a mosaic.

237
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But it was just a thought.

238
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's the thought that we had to be behind it.

239
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah.

240
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So, lots of people standing there.

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Just looking at it.

242
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Just gazing at it.

243
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah.

244
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Wow.

245
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I wonder what they're thinking.

246
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But if you were a piece of a thinking about John Lennon.

247
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But you do get that feeling in your stomach when you're standing there and saying,

248
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Wow.

249
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But then I say it right away.

250
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It really sucked.

251
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, that it was so useless.

252
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, it was so useless.

253
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But that's what I'm saying.

254
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
People go there and they think about John Lennon being shot.

255
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Where am I?

256
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I think he would have preferred people thinking about a world without, you know, what the song

257
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Imagine is about.

258
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wow.

259
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And I think everyone who goes there just thinks about, you got shot.

260
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

261
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Wow.

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And there was the AIDS walk, which,

263
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

264
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I kind of walked a little bit with it and then back the other way.

265
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And we hooked up with.

266
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
My ex-managed John Focardberg.

267
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, who was just, it just happened to be in New York City.

268
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah.

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And that was nice.

270
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And he mentioned that the whole show business, especially in America.

271
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And of course, especially in Holland.

272
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And everywhere, actually, it has changed so much.

273
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Totally different.

274
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Different way of.

275
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, yeah.

276
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That is true.

277
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The music business, particularly you said, you know,

278
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and unless you're into hip hop and R&B, there's no money to be made.

279
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And it actually looks pretty funny.

280
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because what was it for the way?

281
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
How was you talking about Alicia Keys?

282
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

283
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And he's out work.

284
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So Alicia Keys needs to get a hit.

285
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And then she'll have a song.

286
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And then ludicrous will show up for $250,000.

287
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There's no rap on the song.

288
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then all of it.

289
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And you'll get royalties and points on the album and everything.

290
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And that's how you actually make a hit these days.

291
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You got to get a singer and then you connect it up with someone.

292
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's good.

293
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This one.

294
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This person in a rap.

295
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Someone's doing the beats.

296
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But it's definitely, it's not what it used to go.

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We know that.

298
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah.

299
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I know it sounds always so old foggy.

300
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So old foggy, you may say.

301
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's not used.

302
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But I still love the pure, honest music.

303
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What are you talking about?

304
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, that comes from the heart instead of,

305
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, rap and hip hop.

306
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

307
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're right.

308
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's what I mean.

309
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

310
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

311
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No, I agree.

312
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That is the part that bothers me too.

313
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's still manufacturing hits.

314
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

315
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's such a thought behind it.

316
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

317
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay.

318
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then.

319
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Martha surprised us.

320
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

321
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We can't.

322
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
She had tickets.

323
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
For the, um, I'm broccoli.

324
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm Judy Roberts.

325
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Um, a three days of rain.

326
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's a play.

327
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's not a play bill there.

328
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

329
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So this is actually a big deal because, well, first of all,

330
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
she's a Academy Award-winning actress.

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know, it gets $20 million per movie.

332
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah.

333
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Although her last two movies have been Oceans 11 and Oceans 12,

334
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
which is not exactly exactly what you want on the run.

335
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What do you think she does this?

336
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why?

337
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why?

338
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

339
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why?

340
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Just two babies at home.

341
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why not enjoy that instead of two?

342
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, if you read the article, which I did, she said that she, she had the opportunity.

343
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's only, she's only doing it for 12 weeks.

344
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So it's a very, you know, it's very short run.

345
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Three months.

346
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They call it 12 weeks of rain.

347
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
12 weeks of rain.

348
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, the reviewers actually said two and a half hours of Julia Roberts,

349
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
which I've had.

350
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The reviews of mine.

351
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I keep them staring at her.

352
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, my God.

353
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm looking at Julia Roberts.

354
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,500
Really?

355
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,000
I didn't have that at all.

356
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I didn't have that at all.

357
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,500
I didn't have that at all.

358
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm beginning to have.

359
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,500
I did.

360
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,000
I checked her.

361
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I checked her out.

362
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, before we get to the checking out the run.

363
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,500
The reason she said that her twins are now one and a half.

364
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,000
Hmm.

365
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And she said she had this opportunity, because she's,

366
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,500
they're going into that terrible twos,

367
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,500
as she says in the, in the, in the interview.

368
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Mm-hmm.

369
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
And she felt that she had this opportunity.

370
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

371
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
But it wasn't like some artistic thing.

372
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
She wanted it.

373
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
She wanted it.

374
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah.

375
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:15,700
That doesn't say that or she didn't know she's not gonna admit that but it's always isn't it that

376
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,940
Actors actors always wanted they they want to say I

377
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Was in the theater

378
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,420
Yes, when I back in the days when I did and therter

379
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,020
You know something they they want to say that just once in their life. They want to say no

380
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,300
I don't think you can say all actors want to do that. I'm most of them. No

381
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,260
Why I do a year or the lot. I did some theater

382
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,380
Yeah, well in England. I'll just say that or I come from theater Broadway Broadway

383
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
But anyway, um

384
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
It was very interesting

385
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,860
Yeah, well, it I have to admit that you need so much patience when you're sitting at when you're sitting in a in a theater

386
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,380
Nice theater, by the way. Yeah, very good. And

387
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:08,460
You know the actors really are it is it is a better experience than it was a different experience

388
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,460
The actors are only 15 feet away

389
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,460
Yeah, you could run up and you could you could jump on stage if you wanted to it was nice and cool

390
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,940
You know, it was the air conditioning was on high

391
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,060
God still people can turn off their cell phones, which is very very irritating

392
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,300
Isn't that embarrassing and not not once for like three different people? Oh my god

393
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,140
Yeah, that that's horrible and and they just keep on asking you

394
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,620
Every time it starts but

395
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,340
I have to say that one of the guys I really like wasn't that what's that pole rod? No, that was the guy that we thought sucked

396
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,900
Okay, so it's a Bradley Cooper was actually the guy who

397
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,900
He was really good. He all he had to invite all of a sudden he had a great monologue

398
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,620
When he came on yes, suddenly it opened up and so oh, okay now it's okay

399
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
But the story in general is

400
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,140
Very tiny little tiny if you've ever who if you're red or seen

401
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,460
Like death of a salesman. Yeah, it's something like that

402
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,500
Speak the blue with Madonna with Madonna

403
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,700
But it's I don't know it for me

404
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,060
It's interesting. I'm glad I saw it. Yeah, but it didn't add anything

405
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,580
It was not like wow the story. I'm so you know

406
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,540
Moved by nothing

407
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,500
No, it's not a moving story. It's actually very light nothing special

408
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,300
It's just a part of somebody's life. Well, that's what it play usually is it's just a couple of days

409
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,100
But I don't know I want to feel some excitement

410
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,580
Didn't you feel me next to you baby

411
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
That was it

412
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,420
I knew it next to me

413
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,540
Um, but I think it was good

414
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,380
The tickets were out. This is the hottest ticket on Broadway. I would read justly expensive and completely packed

415
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,700
And it's just it's so funny because you have such a beautiful theater

416
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,740
a play which

417
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,620
Peace which is it's definitely drama no doubt about it. It's a real dramatic piece dark

418
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,140
Some interesting stage effects. I like you know that because it is three days of rain

419
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,220
So lots of rain actually coming down and what did I say why does it doesn't go but then it's so

420
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,820
Typical only in America

421
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,780
Can you then then there's intermission and then we all go sit around and and eat raisinets

422
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,780
You know anything this soul of raisinets you can get a screaming bar made. Yeah, you yeah exactly you can get a Merlot

423
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
or a Shabley classic cup

424
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
Beautiful senior

425
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,620
Beautiful old English theater. That's how it looked and then she's shawy

426
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
That'll be $20. Yeah

427
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
Well, then we all came back and then

428
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,300
Run and I

429
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,980
apologize for them for the eating sounds. Yeah, otherwise it gets cold and we have hopefully

430
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,260
And it's the timing is all messed up

431
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,860
Everyone forgets that that actually takes time and effort to create a show and there's like a million meetings and I say oh by the way

432
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
You know, we still have a show to do

433
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,860
Yeah

434
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,620
So we were done this morning with like one o'clock. We were done with our presentation which were

435
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,500
Which will be on in a couple hours from now

436
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:37,380
And my body is a bit confused. I have to say five o'clock. I woke up. Yeah, well you went to bed early because we were we were downstairs working

437
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,060
You wouldn't sleep at like tennis. I have to get used to the sounds of the traffic in you

438
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
Got about that

439
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
So I'm going off to the conference

440
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,980
A bear stirms internet thing but the bear stirms has been our bank for a long time

441
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
So it's important that we do this for them

442
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,780
And that's lots of other interesting companies who are at this thing today

443
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,980
And what are you going to do? Yvonne's coming because it's amazing. So your ex manager was in New York and now

444
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,740

452
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
When we arrived Saturday

453
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:53,380
Frontage of the of the of the newspapers. Oh, yeah a picture a big brawl in New York Tommy Hilfe here

454
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,420
Who was what?

455
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
58

456
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,100
Actually kicked Axel Rose's ass in a nightclub

457
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
I know

458
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,420
Somehow Tommy was there celebrating someone's birthday or his birthday or whatever and then Axel Rose came in with his

459
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,180
You know Axel Rose course of guns and roses with his big bravado and whatever and there was some scuffle

460
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,780
Tommy Hilfe actually kicked his ass beat him up and

461
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,180
And Axel Rose couldn't I guess they were separated before Axel could get any punches and

462
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
That's fine. Okay, so he'll figure his brother

463
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,140
Yeah, well, you should be able to get the inside dirt

464
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,980
He would jade out make sure he vone gets the inside dirt now. What happened with the rose?

465
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,540
Oh, okay. Yeah, oh, no, that's okay. She has an appointment tomorrow. So today we're gonna just stroll a little bit

466
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,100
Through Manhattan but so tomorrow. That's exciting because

467
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,220
Iván's associate from Holland is gonna

468
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,260
How do you say that English?

469
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
It's actually

470
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,380
Wouldn't it quite the license? Yeah, sorry. Quite the license for Europe for Europe for all of the james

471
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,620
It's exactly exactly because they needed somebody in in Holland and he wants it in Holland or Europe

472
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,940
I think it's for Holland first and then maybe a couple of other can you go buy it in Europe? Can't you somewhere now not yet? No

473
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
But you can buy it in England

474
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,740
So it's not gonna be England but yeah England is always the first one to get everything

475
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:29,460
So that's gonna be very interesting and Iván is a company named him accompanying him

476
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,380
Because Iván's English is very good because she used to live in England and

477
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,340
For nine years and I have to say her English is perfect beautiful you're English is not bad either

478
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:48,980
No, no, no, no, yes, yes, don't say that. I'm trying but I still notice that I'm translating in my hair

479
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,780
Yeah, because it has to stop well the only way to stop is for all of us to start this is what we did when we moved

480
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,460
I have my days. I have to say I have days that they might have my brains really thinking

481
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,060
There's yeah, and I have days that you know coming from the phone or speaking to my

482
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,860
My family and parents that's something that it's it's almost like and computed and you know

483
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,980
It's your Dutch yeah, you have to push it back and then the English comes

484
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,660
So it's not easy

485
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:26,560
Green Green now it's not easy being Dutch actually for many different reasons for a plethora

486
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,660
I know I know I know I don't feel Dutch

487
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,780
No, what do you feel more a sort of a tutti-free thing a tutti-free?

488
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,900
Yeah, sort of everything a bit of they similar to that

489
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,060
Well, when you're in America, you I think you felt pretty pretty good

490
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know yeah, you know why

491
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:58,700
The American language is easier it's slower that's very easy to understand that British English because

492
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,540
Yeah, the British English they just swallow everything and go so fast

493
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:10,700
Then I have to say couples and pardon yeah, excuse me, you know because I have to think what what you know

494
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,080
But you always said to me, don't say just yes, but let them repeat it again

495
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know what they're saying could you never know I don't get

496
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,900
I was like you know something to your friends you think

497
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:32,260
But no just say pardon. I don't I didn't get it can you repeat that again until you get it that's very good message for me

498
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Okay, so

499
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
tomorrow

500
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,900
Tomorrow I have a so today you're gonna be with Yvonne and tomorrow

501
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:52,260
Tomorrow I have another early meeting right after that. Yeah, like nine to nine to ten and right after you and I are going way down town

502
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
Yeah, downtown maybe

503
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,940
And we got to get some paperwork squared away for

504
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,380
For my for my immigration so that I don't get thrown out of the UK

505
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:12,340
That's gonna be fun. We have three different offices. We have to visit downtown three different three different queues three different windows

506
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,340
We'll have to oh yeah, so

507
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,860
I don't know if we want to sound they're gonna push you around

508
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,220
You know how much I love them one window to the other

509
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,860
And then and so I love extra time which thing in extra day in New York

510
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,340
Yeah, so we have time if we need to do anything on Wednesday and then Wednesday at two thirty

511
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,140
We fly to San Francisco and then we go and we arrive at five thirty and we go straight to Pebble Beach

512
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,180
So we won't go it's only an hour from the airport. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh

513
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:47,380
So you were not gonna sleep in San Francisco when in our own bed? Yeah, but yeah, right?

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,180
We only put well, no, we're gonna be in Pebble Beach for a night for one night

515
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,780
two nights, but we first wish we sleeping no because that would only if we left tomorrow

516
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:03,740
Oh, that's right. Yeah, and now we don't but we have to because all these offices here that we need to go to close it three o'clock

517
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,540
And you have to it's a big chill. Yeah, so if we don't do it then you'll be very lonely living in the UK without me

518
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,500
Yeah, you lonely without you

519
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,540
My parents are good at home. You check with them. I check with them. Yeah, and everything is okay

520
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Of course Christina. I last minute everything in the morning my mom has to get used to that

521
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:31,980
She said oh my god, you know the car was waiting for her and she was still doing things and even doing her homework in the morning

522
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,140
Well, she said I am a grand mom or oh my like I said in how and what they said

523
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,900
I forgot it and I have to and she said my mom gets she got oh she gets crazy

524
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,780
Especially older people, you know, they want to do everything purifers

525
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,540
So that's a little bit hard, but everything is fine
