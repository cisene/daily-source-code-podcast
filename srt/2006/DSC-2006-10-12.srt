1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
For the first time ever, the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in one action-packed DVD collection,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You've flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,320
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Available now on DVD.

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,320
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass, and the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Walk over to the window sill, because that's where I first kiss you babe.

11
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,320
But don't think of me not being around.

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Just listen for the sweet sweet sound of the taxi pool and off the driveway.

13
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,320
I'm coming home soon.

14
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I'm coming home soon.

15
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,320
I love it when you're fall asleep, but arms numb and I can't feel them.

16
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,320
But to wake you up would be a shame.

17
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,320
That's how I remember you, stuck here on the Red House special.

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,320
I can't wait to see you again.

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Don't think of me not being around.

20
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Just listen for the sweet sweet sound of the taxi pool and off the driveway.

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,320
I'm coming home soon.

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,320
I'm coming home soon.

23
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,320
No, I don't want to make you cry.

24
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,320
No, there's no need for you to feel blue.

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Because you don't see my reflection in your eyes.

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:09,320
I don't know that every time I know, it's never goodbye.

27
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
I'm trying to seek stays.

28
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I'm coming home, till then I'm just a phone call.

29
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Going out for you.

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm just a phone call.

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm just a phone call.

32
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Going out for you.

33
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm just a phone call.

34
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm just a phone call.

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Go out for me.

36
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm coming home, so

37
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm coming home, so

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
I'm coming home, so

39
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm coming home, so

40
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I do the day, day, day, day, day, day

41
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm coming home, so

42
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,320
If you're off on business, you're away from home, then I'll pitch you that song

43
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Hit the perfect spot, didn't it?

44
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Adam, what all bands?

45
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Coming home soon, taking off episode

46
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,320
477 of the Charlie, Delhi source code

47
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Coming to you from San Francisco, California, it's going to be another beautiful day

48
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,320
And no cow, and I feel like shit

49
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Oh man, I haven't been this sick in a long, long time

50
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,320
And so when I play a song like that, of course you can find it in the pod

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Same music now, works like, ah, you know what I need right now?

52
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
I need some Patricia chicken soup

53
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Ah, long time listeners will know that Patricia's chicken soup with ginger

54
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
is the only thing that really helps against this

55
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,320
It's just been shit, shit, shit

56
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,320
I hate it, I hate it when my body lets me down

57
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Everybody how you doing, it's damn early here in San Francisco

58
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,320
But another full day ahead, please

59
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Anyone who's hearing this at the office

60
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Remind me, I've got to go to black market magic

61
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,320
I've got to go pay for the equipment that I so far been borrowing

62
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,320
It's like, like every single day this week

63
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
It's been like, oh, what time is it?

64
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Oh shit, it's a quarter to eight

65
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,320
I don't think it's open anymore, I gotta go during lunch

66
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Ah, lots of things to talk about today

67
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Some rather big news stories

68
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
And some small news stories

69
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,320
But there is an important story that we're following right now

70
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Which of course is the continuing theory of folders versus scrunchers

71
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,320
I've discovered that I as a lifelong, lifelong folder

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Actually scrunch toilet paper

73
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,320
When I blow my nose and it seems that we're on to something here

74
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Yeah, I'm Jeff Smith, I think you're on to something

75
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,320
I am a scruncher, but when I blow my nose, I fold it up

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
And a nice little square

77
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Hmm, oh, interesting

78
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,320
I'm telling you there's something there, there's a correlation

79
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Wait, that's Jeff Smith, the Jeff Smith from...

80
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,320
So, all I had to do of course was ask you guys

81
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,320
If we had any proof that North Korea had really lit up a nuke

82
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
If there was any seismic activity

83
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,320
And immediately messages started coming in

84
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
I got to actually post it yesterday on korea.com

85
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I posted a link to a map that shows a 4.2

86
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,320
On the Richter scale of seismic activity in North Korea

87
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Interestingly enough, the report is at surface level

88
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,320
So it wasn't apparently a deep explosion

89
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,320
But more people have been after this data

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Hey, and this is young, I'm just posting to your daily source code

91
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
From, well, today and I can't just leave the game

92
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm on a plot right now, just end all of it

93
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Well, anyway, the nuke in North Korea was 3.5, 4.5

94
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,320
On the Richter scale, I've heard both

95
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,320
They said it wasn't very big, or as big as the North Koreans wanted

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
It's the big, or that's what they say

97
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,320
But the missiles is true, they're over-exaggerating that

98
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,320
But I've been reading that North Korea has quite a few submarines

99
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,320
They have, say, you could bring them into the cargo

100
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Or they could fly them in their planes

101
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,320
They're just, thanks to worry about why South Korea could fly in with their planes

102
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,320
So just, they're having it as a bad thing

103
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Well, anybody having a nuke is kind of a bad thing

104
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,320
But just because they don't have a missile or a proper missile that can make California

105
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
They could just take it right into the bay

106
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,320
All right, pleasant thoughts, bye

107
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
And voter as I said yesterday

108
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Bye, thanks

109
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,320
All right, this still doesn't, you know, it's not that I don't want to believe it

110
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Couldn't a large variety of explosive devices

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Created 4.2 on the Richter scale

112
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,320
You know, how do we know that it wasn't actually a nuke that was lit up

113
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,320
And is this the only sides of nuke they can make?

114
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
You know, there's all kinds of things to consider there

115
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Now, I'll say right up front

116
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,320
That my uncle Don who, you know, I'm missing him again on this trip

117
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
But he has told me quite clearly, he says they're nuts in North Korea

118
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Kim, Kim Yang Il

119
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Is absolutely nuts

120
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
So if they had a nuke, yeah, he would probably use it

121
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
But it could, you know, look at this guy

122
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,320
He's totally, he's all image, you know, look at his hair

123
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Look at his posture, look at his clothes

124
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
You know, his clothes really say

125
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Hey, I'm the most important dude in the room

126
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,320
The glasses, the logger-filled glasses

127
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,320
He could be a very brilliant strategist in that regard

128
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,320
And I'm just wondering, I don't know anything about nuke

129
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I don't know anything about nuclear fission

130
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Or fusion

131
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Simon Test does who's in the UK Simon

132
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
You're the expert on nuclear stuff

133
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Once you dial in

134
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,320
And give me the opinion on this stuff

135
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Okay

136
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Because so far, yeah, there was a seismic activity

137
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
4.2 in the Richter scale

138
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
That doesn't seem like a huge deal

139
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
I mean, it depends on where it takes place

140
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,320
But just from my recent recollection of actual earthquakes

141
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,320
4.2 doesn't seem like it's like it's some huge deal

142
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,320
If you've got any information on that, you know what to call

143
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,320
1.2.1.6.2.5.6.3.5.7.

144
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
1.1.2.1.6.5.6.7.

145
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
1.2.1.6.6.7.

146
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
This week on the Big Break Music Podcast

147
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
You can hear the music and our interview

148
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
With Podsafe Music Artist Lisa Dames

149
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
As we explore her album, no one like me

150
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Because it could have been me

151
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,320
The phone that's green or my face

152
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,320
On the cover of the magazine

153
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Here, Lisa Dames as she reveals

154
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
The intimate and emotional story behind her songs

155
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
And then we went up into the studio

156
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
And he played it for me on the piano

157
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
And I just started crying

158
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
It's so hard to sing the song because I have to hold back so much

159
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Because if I don't hold back, I will start crying

160
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
As I'm singing that song

161
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
And we get a behind-the-scenes look

162
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Into the making of her chart climbing single

163
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Just another day

164
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
And we get to hear about the fun times as well

165
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
In time we get it, we just get a little bit right here

166
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
And a little bit right here

167
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I mean we might as well stay in the country vibes

174
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Since we're doing

175
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
We're going to a sad life repair man

176
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Coming after you

177
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Sad life repair man

178
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
What's he gonna do?

179
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
He'll fit your misconceptions

180
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
And answer questions too

181
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Turn nothing in the universe

182
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
And he can't do for you

183
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Sad life repair man

184
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Sad life repair man

185
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Yeah

186
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Everybody

187
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
That's not like I have anything from PW to play for you

188
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
But yeah, you go from one country promo

189
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Just about this North Korean thing again

190
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
The only reason I'm bringing it up

191
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Is because it was not that long ago

192
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,320
That we were led to believe that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction

193
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Capability

194
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Capabilities

195
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
And I quite distinctly remember

196
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Areal photographs showing

197
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Possible launch sites, build sites, vials

198
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Of anthrax

199
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Remember that

200
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
G

201
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
So, you know, I'm just saying

202
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
It's like okay, we've got all these

203
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
You know, all these pictures of

204
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Of ill walking around

205
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Looking from mighty important

206
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Of course, it's all file footage

207
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Of rockets launching an air

208
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Of course, it's all file footage

209
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
And we've got a statement from them

210
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Which is new

211
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
We've got nukes

212
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
North Korean

213
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
But I presume it's exactly what he said

214
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
And we have some seismic activity

215
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
That to me does not prove it's a nuk

216
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
But, you know, okay

217
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
I don't know what it takes to make nukes

218
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Let's see what they're saying over in

219
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
In blighty about the deal

220
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Hello Adam Lee from UK yet

221
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
While you're off in America then

222
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
I thought I'd just tell you something

223
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
I was really guardians of day

224
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
The 10th to the 10th to the 6th

225
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
And it's the the moment North Korea became a nuclear player

226
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
And on the front page

227
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
There was a huge fire in the grass

228
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Extract

229
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
It's certainly nice

230
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
A seismograph in the geoscience Australia

231
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Identifies North Korean nuclear threats

232
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
About the US medical survey

233
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
It's a magnitude 4.2 seismic event

234
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
So, if you really get on the Guardian website

235
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
I'm sure we'll be off a look at the picture

236
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
And I'm quite a bit sure

237
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
It's quite a

238
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Physmal spike at the time

239
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
When North Korea said it's designated

240
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
And it's matched it as well

241
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
But there you go

242
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
If not I am

243
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
If we'd be locked on to the US

244
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
A logical server website that has it on there

245
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Maybe the geoscience Australia

246
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
South America, I think British geographical

247
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
And even also pick it up as well

248
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
But it won't be as strong

249
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Because anyway

250
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
That's about all these moments

251
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,320
I don't I'm now at university here in Cardiff

252
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
So no longer in Birmingham

253
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I'm now in Wales

254
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Oh

255
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Cardiff

256
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Where my girlfriend Charlotte Church lives

257
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Have you ever seen the Charlotte Church show?

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
If you live in the UK?

259
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
It's interesting because she's competing partially

260
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
With Jonathan Ross, the big Friday night talk show

261
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Which has been gone going for years

262
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Which is also a fantastic show

263
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
I love the Jonathan Ross show

264
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
But this Charlotte Church show

265
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
It starts half hour before

266
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Before Jonathan Ross and since that's on channel 4 I believe

267
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
She's nuts

268
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Charlotte Church was the child prodigy

269
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Who sang classic opera

270
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
When she was I think 12 or 13

271
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Really took the world by storm

272
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
And she's turned into quite a media celebrity in the UK

273
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
And she's funny

274
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
She's funny and deering the shows

275
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Kind of a mess

276
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
But there's something about it

277
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
That I really like

278
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
When the show came out people really slagged her off

279
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
And she does it from Cardiff

280
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
She says it's from Cardiff

281
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Which is where she's from

282
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
I think it's a studio in London

283
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
But that's okay

284
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
A little bit of media hype is all right

285
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
I mean yeah

286
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
If North Korea has the capability to do a media hype

287
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
I wouldn't start a church

288
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
I

289
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Yes

290
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
And I love it when you guys correct me on my grammar

291
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Adam I got to correct you

292
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
You were talking

293
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Playing a call from

294
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Either Mary and Carla

295
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Karen and whatever our name was

296
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
And you corrected her grammatical

297
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
You think she should have said

298
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Carla and I

299
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
But did you a wrong?

300
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
She had a right

301
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
It was Carla and me

302
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
The sense of something like

303
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm at the bunch of people at the podcast

304
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Text bell including me and Carla

305
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Why she has this correct you a wrong dude

306
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
It's not the first time you made that mistake

307
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
She only correct you

308
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Well dude are you so sure dude

309
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
All right

310
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
I know that someone out there who's going to go back and listen to yesterday's episode

311
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
And see if I was right or wrong

312
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
I've always been taught it's

313
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
And I

314
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Not and me and I think that's I think she said Carla and me not me and Carla

315
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
And I believe it's it would be Carla and I

316
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
Of course

317
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
It being Carla and I or Karen and I

318
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
It's all just a pipe dream

319
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
But a girl can dream right you know what I'm saying

320
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Yeah

321
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Long time

322
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,320
She heard about the crash

323
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
And then hadn't yesterday

324
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Pitch for New York and I think it's quite a lot

325
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I don't remember some trouble

326
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I guess and wound up

327
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Session to a apartment complex on the upper west side

328
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,320
So we'll be interested to hear your thoughts on that

329
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
I'm definitely pretty far behind

330
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
So we're also looking forward to hearing

331
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,320
You really thoughts on

332
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Before we get to that

333
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Let's let's pause here for a second with Corey Lidal

334
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Because the same thing really

335
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
You know

336
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Ever since I heard this yesterday afternoon

337
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
We were at the office

338
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,320
And it was a little unclear it was going on of course

339
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
You know for a brief moment there is shock waves

340
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,320
I go you know spread throughout the country and throughout the world

341
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,320
The first thing everyone thought is oh my gosh, you know another plane into a building

342
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,320
And every single news reporter would say

343
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Five years on one month to the date

344
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Because of course it was on the 11 so they had some kind of hook there

345
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Some kind of tie in

346
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
But it was a very unfortunate accident

347
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,320
And when I heard this when I heard a small craft crashing into a

348
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Into a building you know I immediately think wow

349
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
You know this is there's something very wrong

350
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,320
In fact I was like I'd be leave suicide before

351
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
I believe that a freak accent like that happened

352
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
And I started to amass the information

353
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Very very hard to get any valuable information

354
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,320
On this particular story from mainstream news

355
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,320
And again, it just goes to show that when you actually know something about a topic

356
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
How piss poor just piss poor

357
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
The news media is at reporting

358
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Now they get some things right like fire

359
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
We could see that you know

360
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,320
The level of floor of the apartment that the fire is on you know that stuff

361
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,320
I saw Bloomberg report that the CR20 aircraft was a 15 seat passenger plane

362
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,320
You know it's like no it's not it's a four-seater

363
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Okay, so

364
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
And there was actually there was one I think it was on

365
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,320
I don't know if it was on Larry King. It was I think it was definitely CNN at one point

366
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,320
A former executive for the National Aviation Transportation Board

367
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
The NATB

368
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Came on and this was clearly a guy who had

369
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Researched a couple of facts and I must have been an airman because he did have some great information

370
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,320
So let me start by saying

371
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Here's the information that I've collected that I believe to be

372
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,320
You know some of the facts. First of all Corey Lidal

373
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Was a pilot who had 400 hours of experience

374
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Any experience pilot will tell you that there is definitely a spike in accidents

375
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Pilate error based accidents when pilots have between three and 400 hours

376
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
That is just about the time where you're feeling very comfortable

377
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
In fact they had a couple of

378
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Guys really horrible and they've flown along with him in his previous aircraft

379
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,320
I guess a system 172 probably for some TV special or something that he did or some profile of him

380
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
And you hear him saying you know how comfortable he feels in the air

381
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
And that's exactly

382
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,320
The issue with these three to 400 hour pilots and and this has been told to me many many times when I reached

383
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,320
About 253 hundred hours the wind commander my instructor said dude

384
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,320
This is where you really got a fucking watch your shit because now you think you got it all down

385
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,320
You know what you're doing and something really fucking crazy can happen

386
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,320
So let's just put that right up front and

387
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,320
And I think that is actually provable by statistics that once you get to the three four hundred hours

388
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Is a private pilot that's where really normally shit can happen

389
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,320
And it's purely a confidence issue so it's all about pilot error

390
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Okay, what else did we learn?

391
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,320
We learned from from this guy from the NATB or formerly of the NATB that there was a cloud ceiling of 1500 feet

392
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:55,320
But in the the Eastern corridor of New York in order to fly there under the configuration that light

393
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
I was flying the type of aircraft

394
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,320
The type of license he has flying under visual flying rules visual flight rules

395
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:11,320
He was apparently at 1100 feet now 1100 feet is okay. It's not really high. You know it really isn't it's about 300 meters

396
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,320
So if you have an engine failure you're going to be on the ground relatively quickly

397
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,320
It's it's just a fact of you know a physics

398
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,320
So he was coming from north to south going down the east side of Manhattan

399
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Manhattan

400
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,320
There was again according to the NATB former executive there was a rather strong wind from the east

401
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:43,320
So if you're flying along the Eastern corridor of Manhattan and the wind is coming from the east and it's relatively strong

402
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,320
If you have if you're under full powered flight and your engine is working

403
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,320
You actually will not be your your aircraft will not be pointed straight on a north to south track

404
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,320
You'll actually be pointing into the wind is very much like sailing

405
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Where's you don't notice this when you're flying in a commercial airliner

406
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,320
You really don't notice it in any aircraft unless you're up front but you're actually flying sideways

407
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,320
And that's because the wind is pushing you

408
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,320
You know in the opposite direction of which the wind is coming

409
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,320
So if you have an engine failure

410
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,320
You know you're going to have to think about

411
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,320
You know what am I going to do because the wind is obviously going to become a more powerful force as you have less power

412
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,320
And you still have inertia and momentum

413
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,320
So you know if you turn into the wind you're going to slow down significantly

414
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
If you turn away from the wind

415
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,320
With the wind to the back you know you obviously powered or not powered you're going to be you know flying faster

416
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
And you're going to be going towards Manhattan

417
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,320
So from some of the some of the eye witness accounts

418
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Some people said they thought it was a helicopter which is kind of weird now

419
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,320
You know a serious SR20 can look like a helicopter so I can understand where they're coming from

420
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,320
But others were saying that it looked like was kind of out of control like it was dipping left and right

421
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:14,320
And then there's a unconfirmed report of a made a about a either fuel starvation or

422
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Something wrong with the fuel system

423
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
So when I put this all together

424
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Oh and by the way visibility was eight or nine miles that was what was reported is eight or nine miles

425
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,320
So mind you only a 400 feet under the cloud cover it could easily have been a little bit hazy

426
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,320
You know these reports I've had lots of eight to nine mile clear visibility reports and you get up there

427
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,320
And you're like yeah it's more kind of like four you know that just happens

428
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,320
So that's all we know from the ground reporting or the terminal area forecast

429
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,320
So here's oh and then the final piece of information which is really really critical

430
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,320
Crap I don't know if I'm going to get this whole story and for you serious stars one or two listeners I really hope I do

431
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Shit it's a good story

432
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Apparently Corey also had his instructor on board

433
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Now you'd think that would make it a very very safe situation

434
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Well that really depends on the instructor and I have to say you know having been flying with the a safety pilot or instructor for a

435
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Well for most of my flying actually I love having someone on the right hand seat even though I'm doing all the work

436
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:27,320
You know when situations occur and instructor will typically let you deal with the situation and maybe jump in and do something

437
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,320
If necessary now when it comes to an emergency

438
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Particular something where the engine may fail a lot of the instrumentation

439
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,320
For solving that issue is on the left-hand side of the aircraft. It's it's in the pilot seat. That's where the ignition key is

440
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:50,320
That's where the fuel pipe. Oh in the series SR20 the fuel pump may actually be located in the middle on the middle console

441
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Ask shit. Hey serious guys gals daily source code.com

442
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,320
If you want to hear the rest of my theory about Corey light. Oh, sorry about that windows closed and p-dub shut me out can't help anything

443
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
All right, we're still here, right

444
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,320
So a lot of that of the controls and instrumentation for engine management are on the pilot seats

445
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,320
So I'm just going to go into just assume that the pilot

446
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,320
Corey light on this case was sitting left seat and had most of the controls so

447
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Here's what I believe may have happened and and the whole theory

448
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,320
gets more believable with the visibility

449
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,320
With knowing more about visibility and the actual strength of the wind coming from the east, but here's what I think could have happened

450
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
They're flying along

451
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:49,320
And they're going north to south and there's this eastern Lee strong, eastern Lee wind and the engine quits and I guess they determine that it is because

452
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Either their tank or tanks are empty

453
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,320
But what they essentially try I believe is by rocking the wings back and forth banking

454
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,320
You know some significant banking which could give an out of control look

455
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,320
They may have actually been trying to have fuel spill over from either of the tanks to get into the ignition into the car

456
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
Rator into the ignition

457
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,320
I'm not completely 100% down on how the serious fuel flow system works

458
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
I'm sure that the fuel pump is necessary

459
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,320
I don't think it's a gravity-based system since it's a low wing

460
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
So they were probably trying to

461
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Get the engine restarted and get some fuel flow and you know back in by rocking the wings

462
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Now while this is taking place while you're doing this rocking the wings remember that the wind if strong enough is really pushing

463
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,320
The aircraft towards Manhattan now I've only seen some

464
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Some flight paths that you know look like it might have been this particular aircraft flight path

465
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,320
They may actually done a 360 and no matter which way they turn that 360

466
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,320
If they're trying to rock the wings and trying to restart this stuff and you're to eleven hundred feet

467
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
And you're you're descending

468
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,320
You're going to be on the ground in just a couple minutes as no two ways about it

469
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,320
And I believe what happened here is the instructor made a bad decision

470
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,320
The instructor probably said you know, and if he were flying a left seat and he was in total control

471
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,320
It may have had a different outcome and this is again, it's just a theory, you know, and no one has to blame this is just how shit goes

472
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,320
I believe the instructor probably said dude, let's try and restart this thing

473
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Rock the wings

474
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
Let's see if we can get some fuel flowing

475
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
They're probably doing this while

476
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Turning

477
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Out of the wind because you know when when you have an emergency like that you don't want to turn into the wind immediately

478
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,320
You want to get the best glide so you can stay in the air the longest so you have the long you know the most

479
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Opportunity to find a place to land and guess what there is only one answer in this case there's only one place in fact

480
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,320
I believe when this happened

481
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,320
They should have immediately said, okay, we're going into the river there's no two ways about it

482
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,320
We're going into the river and you know you can try your restarts on your way down into the river

483
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:19,320
But what probably happened is they're trying to get their best glide they're drifting towards Manhattan

484
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,320
They're rocking the wings they may have both had heads down looking at the fuel pump looking at gauges trying to start some stuff

485
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,320
You go into another turn you've lost track of how far the wind push you you look up and you crash into the fucking building

486
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:40,320
I think that is exactly what happened and it's it's horrible and it's and there's no reason that it had to happen

487
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,320
It's just one of these things where all these elements come together at the wrong time and it's it's horrific

488
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:56,320
And it's bad for aviation it's it's bad for for people who were involved in this and lost lives and and property etc

489
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,320
But it really just sucks

490
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Particularly because this type of aircraft and this is I think then I don't know how many of these seerses have crashed

491
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,320
But this is the only general aviation aircraft that I know of that has a ballistic parachute

492
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,320
And I'm not a big fan of that because you know essentially there's a there's a red handle in the roof

493
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,320
And if you run into trouble you pull that handle an actual you know rocket

494
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Explode and blast off with a parachute which can help the aircraft float down to the ground

495
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Don't for one single minute think that that is in dangerous or that you're you know you have a 100% chance of survivability because you do not

496
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,320
You know you're probably going to wreck the airframe you could harm yourself particularly your back, you know

497
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,320
The seats are designed to to withstand a certain amount of G forces upon impact

498
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,320
But you could you know still be seriously messed up, but the chances of survival are pretty good

499
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:06,320
I personally I don't think an aircraft manufacturer that supplies aircraft with a parachute says a lot about you know what they think of their product

500
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,320
And it's a and it's a very popular aircraft the SR20 and the SR22

501
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:20,320
And these guys never deployed it and again, I think that's because there was an instructor onboard and you know when you deploy the shoot you're kissing the plane goodbye

502
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,320
You know, yeah, it may be salvageable, but

503
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,320
The shoot was not deployed these shoots have been deployed I think nine times so far with varying results

504
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,320
Some people walk away some people have been pretty seriously injured despite deploying the parachute

505
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:45,320
And I think it's just a whole bunch of unfortunate events that occurred all at the same time and I truly believe that that's what happened

506
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:52,320
And I know there's a lot of pilots and aviators who listen to the daily source code, so wouldn't mind hearing from you guys what you think about it

507
00:30:52,320 --> 00:31:00,320
You know, I'm going to stop the show now. I'm so bummed out about that I really am and I'm feeling like shit and I got to work to do

508
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Hey, tomorrow will be football Friday. I promise you that I'll take lots of night quill tonight and I'll have all kinds of

509
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Tylenol and and caffeine for tomorrow morning so we can really kick off the the weekend with a rock and fucked up beyond our repair daily source code

510
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,320
So send in your pod safe music tunes

511
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Well, this stuff you want to recommend. I'm sure that the official music colleges of the Charlie Josie Todd will be checking in as well

512
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,320
One song that I left for you today. This is you know, I love the shakes with Liberty Jones and what pops up on the pod safe music network is a new version of it

513
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,320
And of course, you know, I love this stuff about, you know, pod safe music because you can release whatever you want whatever you want and it's a whole new version of the song

514
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:45,320
In this case, it's say duet with the or a yeah, to the shakes and featuring lady A

515
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,320
That's all I know about her and of course the song is titled Liberty Jones

516
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Have a little little tea Jones

517
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Was in the shop that she

518
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Lissons to music like Spain

519
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Well, there's no customers

520
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Just because she don't ride to drive

521
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Takes a sea a star of high

522
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,320
Depth is a thought outside

523
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,320
To the river and night

524
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,320

561
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,720
Show was brought to you part by Splenda. I'm actually considering giving these guys some of their

562
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,760
money back because you guys listening are so excited about Splenda. I had no idea this seems to

563
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,400
be an entire culture of mixing these flavors together to come up with new exotic taste for

564
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,680
your coffee. So Splenda is a sugar substitute. It comes in the yellow packets and it comes in

565
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,640
was it French vanilla, hazelnut and one other one. It's only three flavors I think it is.

566
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,800
So a lot of you have been sending me emails about what you mix it with to get that perfect

567
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:57,640
taste of coffee to come up with new blends. Send me that stuff in audio. This is great. This is the

568
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,920
advertising does it just makes itself once again I love it. I'm more information about Splenda

569
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,200
at dailysourcecode.com in the show notes you can go check it out. Tomorrow was a sad food bar Friday

571
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,760
obviously thoughts and prayers go out to all of those involved in the Corey Lightle incident

572
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:26,360
and crap man look what's happened in the world that's just a little thing you know we're all

573
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,200
