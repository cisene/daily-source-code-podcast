91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,480
Hey everybody how you doing good to good to see all again there sitting with those earbuds

92
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,600
jammed in deep sitting at your desk in the car on the bicycle, daily source code episode

93
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,040
number 454 good to talk to you again.

94
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,040
No real set show or format today I just wanted to go through all my voice mills with you

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,840
which I was doing this morning since we hadn't spoken and there was now three days and

96
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,040
there's just so much good stuff coming and I'm just going to go through it with you

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,180
I thought that's going to be experienced listen to someone's voice mail see what kind of

98
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:37,000
shit they get every single day some great aviation in the past couple days I will bore

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,800
you just a little bit with it we had to go to Amsterdam twice on Friday Patricia had

100
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,960
to go to get a copy of her driver's license we need two forms of identification when

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,760
we go later on in the month when we get our when actually Christina and I get our E.E.A.

102
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,440
visas with meaning we will be official and can live here thanks to the graces of the

103
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:06,560
lady Patricia so I got Captain Dan and we took off Friday morning it was yeah that was

104
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
it was just reasonable weather it wasn't too bad drop Patricia off then we went to

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,000
Antwerp to go see the wing commander came back and went back with Patricia and then

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,880
Saturday morning you'll recall I think I told you this the second of September we

107
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,000
were going to go spread my mom's ashes in the butterfly park that we'd found and

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,800
weather was pretty much crap new was happening I was going to stay overnight and come

109
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,120
back Sunday so the plan was to go from ferrox which is the the big holes ask airfield

110
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,800
here near the curry cottage to fly across the English channel Saturday morning stay

111
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,120
overnight in Amsterdam then fly back Sunday morning so we had pretty much and this is

112
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
what I love about aviation weather reasons you can really pretty much get your window of

113
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,640
opportunity down to you know about half an hour and you'll be right on and we left at

114
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,800
what do you leave at 9 a.m. yeah we left at 9 a.m. local UK time just as it was

115
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,040
starting to rain and the rain is not a big deal not afraid of rain that's just

116
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,640
liquid sunshine but it's the cloud cover if that's too low below us and say

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,080
excuse me this and say a moment brought to you by sessna aviation below a thousand

118
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,640
feet it gets really messed up if you're going VFR visual flying rules which

119
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,960
means you're pretty much under the clouds but the terrain in the UK does rise up

120
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,160
here and there so you don't want to be too low because you could be eaten mountainside

121
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,240
so that was actually okay the crossing across the channel was nice but then the

122
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,400
cloud cover really came down and it came down to maybe I was like 700 feet

123
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,960
around Rotterdam and here's something and I'm going to tell you this story and this

124
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,000
is not like oh boy how cool was this this is really actually a very dangerous

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,400
situation we ran into really stupid on our part I have to say you have two

126
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,920
tanks in in this aircraft one on each wing and there's a separate indicator for

127
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,320
each tank and you have a fuel selector which you can select the both tanks or

128
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,160
the left tank or the right tank and it has a gravitational pull system so

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,040
basically the just because of sheer gravity the fuel flows from the wing tanks

130
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:31,320
down into the you know the carburetor and through the engine etc now I guess the

131
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,640
you know the trust always trust your instruments doesn't really apply here

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,760
now we had you know lots of wind and it was kind of it was it was rocky we

133
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,720
had a luggage on board so it was completely conceivable that our right tank was

134
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,720
emptying out quicker than our left tank and so we decided Captain Dan and I

135
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,120
to put the fuel selector onto the left tank for a while now this could have been

136
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,760
a very critical mistake and in fact it turned out to be one only we were

137
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,560
extremely lucky as it turns out and the other systems have a fuel pump by

138
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,680
the way and this fuel pump you use when you take off when you land just in

139
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,680
case for some reason there's not enough gravity you hit an air pocket or

140
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,920
something you'll always be sure that fuel is is being pushed through into the

141
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,160
into the into the ignition system into the cylinders that could you know

142
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,600
through the engine you need fuel to run so when you switch tanks you also turn

143
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,680
on the fuel pump briefly etc now there's a fuel pressure gauge which

144
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,520
basically shows you that there's fuel flowing through the lines and we're

145
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,960
above Rotterdam we're actually just about to go down to the clouds at 700 feet

146
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,680
so this is always a moment where you kind of looking for a hole and there

147
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,920
really isn't one just you can barely broken see the to the broken clouds you

148
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,840
can see the ground and so we're descending maybe from a thousand feet down

149
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,880
from the cloud in the clouds essentially to underneath the cloud layer and I

150
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,960
see and Dan says at the moment I see it that all of a sudden the fuel pressure

151
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,640
gauge is you know hitting the the bottom of the range like oh wait a minute

152
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,560
and as my hand my left hand reaches out towards the fuel pump the engine

153
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,440
stops and by this time I've hit the fuel pump I I threw the fuel selector to

154
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,000
both and the engine caught again it was without a doubt one of the scariest

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,640
moments of my aviation career now could we have landed yeah we were above

156
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,760
field etc but that was not the plan and you know at this happened we were

157
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,840
lucky it happened there what if it happened on final right before landing and I

158
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,000
just wanted a little bit of extra engine speed you know air speed and I just

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,160
wanted to rev the engine and quit there that could have been disastrous so

160
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,360
got on the phone with wind commander William and man there's a whole bunch of

161
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
physics involved in this and some some knowledge which was very good

162
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,360
Sessna makes crappy as fuel indicators in fact so where the right hand fuel

163
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,680
indicator was indicating that we were almost empty even though we're

164
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,080
flying on the left tank in fact it was reverse and it's it totally freaked me

165
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,440
out and so now of course the rule is you always fly with both and you know I

166
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,000
know the endurance I know how long I can fly but you never switch from left

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,360
to right in this particular aircraft and it's big big big piece of knowledge

168
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,480
and it was very very scary but anyway so we made it fine and Sunday it was

169
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,320
even worse weather but it was like 40 knots headwind going back and we

170
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,440
till we came back to this airfield we'd parked the aircraft and it was like

171
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,680
three in the afternoon because that's when the weather was finally going to

172
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,200
let up and we were the first people to fly out of the airplane was the only

173
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,160
one I was sitting on the on the airfield and so we hopped in and man there was

174
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,960
some real flying some awesome I mean this was like 40 50 knots gusting headwind

175
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,160
rain all before we reached the English channel and that was an even half way

176
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,320
over the channel and we could hear this guy going from he was coming from

177
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,440
Holland he was going to Duxford which is the famous airfield here in the UK

178
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,920
where they have an airfield museum he was flying a spitfire and so he was

179
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,280
behind us so we knew what he had just come out or he was just going into and

180
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,000
you know at a certain point we had clear skies was beautiful over the

181
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,920
channel but really you know our air speed was you know no more than 90 knots

182
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,280
that and this thing can do you know 160 so it was like real heavy headwind

183
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,360
here this guy in the spitfire gone it's bloody awful and made great

184
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,120
the channel bloody awful it was like a movie and we were being thrown left and

185
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,600
right but that was a completely safe situation it was just real aviating was a

186
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,480
great birthday present because of course that was Sunday my 42nd birthday and

187
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,040

188
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,440

189
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,520
me feel good about my my new old age hey Adam it's Mark Yoshimoto

190
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,320
Nemkoff and you know with your birthday coming up this Sunday I thought I

191
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,600
do something for you and I was thinking about back in those days when you were on

192
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,600
MTV and I used to watch you and I was an elementary school and I never thought

193
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,680
the day would come where I'd actually be working for you good times good times

194
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,080
so I wanted to do something special and since I can't buy you a helicopter or anything

195
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,320
I thought I'd write you a song you know it's thinking maybe I'd write something

196
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,560
that reminds me of every rose has its thorn or some piece of crap like that

197
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:57,240
you're still kind of furry and your nipples get hard when you get cold

198
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,400
Mark your lyrics of killing me I tell you once cuz I'm no fool the daily sauce

199
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,880

205
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,100
well in the maze and arranged that one for me she's got the my Marilyn

206
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,080
podcast and she sent me a naked picture with Marilyn Monroe I think I

207
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,600
seen that one before let's see lots of stuff about Liam hey Adam it's Matt

208
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,920
to tell you the match today in history podcast a couple things concerning

209
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,960
Christina and Liam my best friend as a daughter who's 15 and when she was a

210
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,880
little girl and he and I were in the navy together we came up with an idea of

211
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,000
how to foil a future boyfriends and it starts with you taking a picture of

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,680
yourself naked from the rear you'd have your hands in the air as if you were

213
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,600
maybe holding something over your head or you know maybe about the throw a

214
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,200
football and you take that picture and super impose it on a picture of a

215
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,560
polar bear standing upright and then you blow this picture up you hang it on

216
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,680
your living room all and then when Liam comes over you don't mention the

217
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,560
picture you just let him see it and then have say Patricia walk by and look at

218
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,520
the picture and look at you and go oh honey you were so brave that day and then

219
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,520
just walk on and that way our ladle sit there and try to figure out what the

220
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,880
hell you were doing wrestling with a polar bear probably defending your

221
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
defending your family or something like that I you know I can actually just use

222
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,320
the picture I have with Michael Jackson you know it's just a scary and also

223
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,960
and I borrowed this from the movie lock stock and two smoking barrels I don't

224
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,000
think guns are the answer I think knives are the answer because it's much

225
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,040
easier for the lad to come over and for you to be sharpening set of knives

226
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,720
and tomorrow quotes from that movie not a regular knife but a big fuck off

227
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,080
shiny knife that's bound to get the kids attention especially if he's not very

228
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:05,080
sharp you know bright shiny object might get his attention anyway and one last

229
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:11,040
thing yeah he does wow thanks you know you had the only one who suggested

230
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,280
something other than guns to scare off the much older boy friend of my daughter

231
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,840
and the podcast is helping just find by the way a couple of christina's friends

232
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,800
heard the show and they they played it for Liam only the good bit and now he's

233
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,640
afraid to come by hey Adam this is done calling from Katie Texas this is

234
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:38,160
response to the color from South Florida on the Charlie 452 just positive

235
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,160
telling me this call I have suggestions for guns in the cabinets he can

236
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,760
introduce him to nothing wasn't might not work for you live given the local

237
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,840
laws besides guns are relatively recent in the human psyche swords that's

238
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,200
picked it 4,000 years of dealing with them we still have an innate fear of

239
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,800
them so my sort of question is going to be quite prominent when my daughter gets

240
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,600
to that age I have a friend who has a six foot long clay more that's sharp

241
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,000
it he was out practicing one's own team to pick up his daughter and he

242
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,640
walks off a three inch branch in a single school because you're bringing my

243
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,360
daughter home early right right yeah just how you'd like to know make your

244
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,360
folder good folder feedback that's for sure yeah there's something to that

245
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,000
you know and then of course I told y'all about my fencing history and this

246
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,080
fits very nicely into this whole swords versus guns thing hey Adam wait

247
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,360
for a while here just listening to the daily source code and I had to call in

248
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:48,800
on your comment about after doing your exercise lunges and the comment about

249
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,120
being on the fencing team and making the comment that fencing was

250
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,360
faggotty dude what other sport I don't think I said faggotty I think I said

251
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,560
fanggy teaches you to kill somebody with a single stroke missed true

252
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,400
I could fancy in high school yeah we thought it was a little faggotty too

253
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,960
I tell you it was a good workhead and when we got to play with the savers that

254
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,200
was kick ass and I was never in your caliper competition we were more just

255
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,240
guys goofing around with the swords but our teacher had been on one of the

256
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,120
coach so he knew what he was talking about you know as he said if you think

257
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,600
this is a 50 sport if we take the tips off these and don't use the pads I

258
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,160
could kill all of you in five minutes he was a great teacher be cool dude

259
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:46,800
take care oh and yeah folder of course folder I knew it yeah I never got to the

260
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,720

new curry cottage hello Adam this is Craig Horton I live in Jackson, Tennessee

341
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,840
I just want to give you a shout out as you ask some of your listeners to

342
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,120
call in and kind of let you know who's listening I don't think a demographic is

343
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,560
always quite what you think it is for instance I'm a 63-year-old grandfather

344
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,040
after four years in the Navy during the Vietnam War I worked for 26 years

345
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,680
for the state of Tennessee and retired and then worked for a number of years as a

346
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:47,440
mortgage broker and by the way good God the home purchase system in the UK has

347
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,560
got to be the most bold up thing I've ever heard of in my life it had to have

348
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,600
come over with old build a conqueror and if it was already there when the

349
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,840
Norman's got there then they should all be damned to hail eternally for not

350
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,720
changing it thank God I didn't have it was bad enough in the States but nothing

351
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,320
like that but anyway I have spent a lot of time in front of computers I have two

352
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,560
PCs a desktop and a laptop I listened to a lot of podcasts and I'm subscribed to

357
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,640
