You suck the light fire of every room, how much can I take, I don't know

26
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,020
To keep a car on the road even the Department of Motor Vehicles not a place you want to go necessarily, but you know

27
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,640
It's automated it's systemated it's hydromated and you can get your shit done if you want to

28
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,520
So we've had the the Jaguar in the UK for a year now and

29
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,560
You know the I've renewed the the insurance and they have this thing which is the license tax

30
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,240
And you know the car comes well when I bought it they just got an a license a tax disc

31
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,360
Which is basically the sticker that you put on your on your windshield and it expired

32
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
It expired in November

33
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,920
So I have to get a new tax disc and you get a thing in the mail

34
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,880
That what does it cost like soren or tax or what I basically you can choose by

35
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,520
Between paying the tax and getting a new tax disc for the next 12 months

36
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,600
So you can drive legally on the road or you can declare it off road and you have to fill out certain papers

37
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,040
And this will any can't be on the street if it's in your garage or whatever

38
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,620
So you know I took the car to the dealer. I got the MOT tests. You know a test that I guess is for the

39
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
I don't know MOT was a stand for

40
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ministry of transportation

41
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,880
So you know it the car complies I have this certificate. I have my inch and I read the instructions on the letter

42
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,480
They sent me which was filled with all kinds of yellow and blue colors and lots of tiny letters and I really

43
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,480
Concentrated on it and it's that you know here's what you need you need to send off the originals the original

44
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,960
Certificate of insurance the original MOT certificate and your check for I don't know what is it?

45
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
It's something like 100

46
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,960
100 pounds whatever it is and then they'll send you back a tax disc

47
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,720
So I did this before I left and I just got an email from Patricia when I got up this morning

48
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,000
They sent it back. They're really good at sending shit back to me including my money

49
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,400
You know, please refer to the conversation about me trying to pay for the for the speeding ticket

50
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,280
Which they also sent back and you know, they won't do it until I have an official

51
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,880
UK license so that they can then subsequently deduct points from my license

52
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,040
They sent it back saying that I had to supply the the car log book

53
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,160
What the hell is that car log? I don't keep a log on my car. What are I gonna do? What is the official car log book?

54
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
You know, I don't even have to do that for my aircraft

55
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,480
So please help me, Brits tell me what to do

56
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,560
I don't want to get a thousand pound fine for driving around with the wrong tax disc

57
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,840
It's frustrating very frustrating. I just don't understand the system. Please help sign your your buddy

58
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Adam

59
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,560
Time to get the ass back in shape been sitting on an a lot of course on the airplane, so I got to firm it up

60
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,520

Oh, oh take deep breaths. I see what this is now take your left leg down and bring the right leg up to the left

70
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,200

71
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,560
Okay, forget to breathe. Yes, I'm breathing and bring the right leg down

Fitness stuff podshow dot com. That's a side until next time

77
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,160
Amy well first of all that was that was kind of easy. I only had to do one on each side that's all

78
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,720
I feel you know like I didn't really have a good workout and of course

79
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm not trying to ignore you Amy

80
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,400
In fact this morning the first thing I do when I walk in is I'm gonna come in there and I'm gonna plant a big one right on your sugar

81
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Whatever that is

82
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
We've talked about the the strip podcast

83
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:08,200
It's a fine podshow podcast emanating from Las Vegas Nevada and because the guys are in Las Vegas and they are very

84
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,760
You know, keyed into into the industry there. I should say the entertainment business

85
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,280
They get a lot of superstars appearing on their show usually via phone in you know call, but it's

86
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,160
It's exactly how it's supposed to work. You know, it's such a stealth show. I love it because I don't think the people

87
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:30,840
Who who are interviewed often realize the reach of this show and these guys are getting press all the time for the outrageous things these

88
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,040
See leberties

89
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Say on their show

90
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,000
Who do we remember we did a whole thing about Chubby checker, but

91
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Dennis Miller

92
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,640
Everyone who comes in the Vegas they all the oh, yeah, well we'll do this little the some kind of internet thing here

93
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,080
That's what I could just hear the press agent right? Yeah, there's some kind of internet show

94
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,520
I just want you to call in and it'll be really nice and you know, it's just a local in Vegas

95
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:02,360
Well, of course, it's not and they had the half on David Hasselhoff on the strip the strip dot podshow dot com

96
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
And

97
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,880
He is he's Mr. Cyberhoff

98
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
He's coming to take over

99
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,240
He's getting ready to do some podcast then right now

100
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm thinking about doing my own television series on the internet really why not

101
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,280
If I've got P if I you got a Google me and sometimes there's anywhere from one million to 15 million people

102
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,080
That are hitting me daily if I've got that audience

103
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,280
Then why shouldn't I do my own television series but not doing an hour? I'm not gonna do an hour

104
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,520
I'll do it like a five-minute series

105
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,240
You want to have people and then get the financing like I did for Baywatch through

106
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
A major company like

107
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,840
Whatever Coca-Cola master quote would it be about and and get these people to finance it and I can do like you know

108
00:14:50,840 --> 00:15:00,200
Secret agent man or or not so secret agent man or something funny or travels with behalf and then just do a five-minute TV series and get it advertised why not

109
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,520
Now, let me tell you something that's fucking cool. Let's get the half on the podshow

110
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh

111
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,920
Man, let me just I got to turn up the volume a little bit on the the output device there for some reason that was a really soft bit

112
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,160
So wait a minute, so you know

113
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:24,920
Just like he did with I don't did he do that with Baywatch? I know that the Baywatch basically failed and then it made it big in the overseas market

114
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,800
I I didn't I thought that there was another producer there

115
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
I could be I think

116
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:37,000
The way the way it worked and I've made hassle half a couple times. I just can't remember the entire store

117
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,240
I know he told it he told to me. I think what happened was

118
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,600
On Baywatch I wasn't going anywhere and they basically could barely pay

119
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,960
Salary for the actors and he said I just give me a piece of the show

120
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,600
I believe in it and he probably didn't have anything else to do with the time and

121
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,880
And then of course it took off became one of the

122
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,920
Indicates and international syndication successes of the 80s and I had made everybody very wealthy who was involved

123
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,960
So it sounds to me like what he's saying is he wants to do a five-minute show every single day or week or who cares

124
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,640
And he wants an advertiser to underwrite it half

125
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,040
half on the podshow

126
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,200
Oh, totally gonna make it happen strip strip guys get me his number get me in touch with the half god dammit

127
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,240
Listen, you've been talking a while now for how the media changes things

128
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,560
To make certain things look a certain way

129
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,720
And well great news you roll over the news yet today after at least the show there's news yet today

130
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,320
The things that happened to Patricia the fall from the chair and

131
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,920
What they did on CZ is actually they cut out the piece of the bell for Charlie

132
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Daily source call the least and

133
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,920
They they made a comment about about about the husband flying with his private jet

134
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,920
And I didn't know it's just now what I had had a jet

135
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,840
But still that proves again that they

136
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,040
Always make things worse or make shoes or make bigger than you normally should sound the diff day

137
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,360
When you listen to the the data source code a lot you know about

138
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,640
About your plan, you know what kind of airplane it is and that's it's a regular turbo prop thing

139
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,680
We have a lot of problems with it. We actually have to blow in your holes and tubes and stuff

140
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,320
To get things you could get things going

141
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,000
But according to Dutch national show business news TV you have a you have a private jet

142
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,920
They well, they didn't mention the word near jet yet, but they made it sound like a hat one

143
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Just letting you know

144
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, dude, thank you so much. Okay. Yeah, this is great. I appreciate the the report

145
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,600
So this was on the was it on Friday show where Patricia and I maybe was Monday show Monday show

146
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,000
Patricia and I talked about about her fall during her rehearsals for dancing with the star

147
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,480
So apparently the Dutch show business new like kind of like some of the entertainment tonight. I guess

148
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,480
On television they they picked up arm the podcast and and they played a piece of it and and they said that

149
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,560
Now I take a little bit of a fence to what you're saying about about the Delta Sierra the Delta Sierra being my lovely

150
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Sess no one a two retractable

151
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Argy

152
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,320
Yes, sometimes you got to blow into its tubes to make sure she's function improperly

153
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,480
But it isn't that some monkey plane is a proper aircraft, you know

154
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,840
It's uh, it's got autopilot IFR all that stuff. It's it's a real airplane

155
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
It ain't no jet

156
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,840
But that is kind of interesting how they pumped that up a misdemeanor flew himself in his private jet

157
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,880
By the way, Sess no makes fantastic jet aircraft the Sess no citation series

158
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,120
You might want to take a look at those not bad at all

159
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,240
But yeah, I guess I guess they just wanted to make it sound better. There you go

160
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,240
And by the way, you made a mistake, too. It is not a turbo prop. It is a

161
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
constant speed propeller

162
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,720
Which is a little different than a turbo prop

163
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,560
Turbo prop actually would be a jet engine with a propeller

164
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,440
But that's okay. We all make mistakes, you know, even the show business guys aren't perfect

165
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,000
Keep our eye on the situation though for them damn liars

166
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,520
I guess the the only thing I'd like to say about that is uh throughout the years I've learned the only thing that is really truthful

167
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,720
On television and in the newspaper are the advertisements

168
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,000
Really like me and I just want to think the academy

169
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
But there's no

170
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,040
Okay, well, I just want to thank the foreign press

171
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,200
No foreign press what the

172
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,840
Who chose these k*** awards

173
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,160
Well, that's f*** great

174
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,600
What the f*** is going all around this f*** place

175
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,800
Well, at least I get a trophy

176
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
This what oh

177
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,280
This whole bloody thing this whole tally thing is just a bunch of sh*** isn't it

178
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,640
Oh, he did me I've been knighted by Adam curry. Oh, and that criminally in 17th song

179
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:18,680
Yeah, what do you freaking do? Yeah, now I've gotten a white show. I mean who the f*** has jersey time think he is

180
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,600
Oh, alright, this is my favorite stand on

181
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,360
That's the first annual jersey touch your award subscribe at jerseyton dot poncho dot com

182
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:39,800
JT from jersey doing that wacky thing again. All right. How do I get in how do I get on these awards? I did I have I won nothing this year

183
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,680
Absolute I was not nominated. I won nothing

184
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,760
The sounds to me like this is the Kanye or what kind of award show where I might be able to get in on the ground floor and actually have a shot at winning something

185
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
So let me know if you nominate

186
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
to

187
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,800
Gary Alexander and I am Colin from Las Vegas have a question for you. I

188
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,440
Host the podcast called the ultimate podcast, which is a podcast based on mixed martial arts

189
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,800
UFC the ultimate fighting competition

190
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Actually the ultimate fighting championship

191
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:41,960
To be exact, but the question is this is that I have had some people go to my iTunes site and leave some negative comments

192
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,680
But it's kind of suspicious because the comments are not just negative

193
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,880
They actually promo another show

194
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Like this guy sucks

195
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,360
You should listen to this show and then they give the name of the other show

196
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,880
So I didn't know if this is some way that I might be able to remove that from iTunes

197
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,760
granted the other the other podcast directories and listings

198
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Do not have that

199
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,960
I do not have that problem there

200
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:18,040
But just want to find out from you first of all, it's actually commenting and it's obviously shitty and

201
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Really don't appreciate it, but

202
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,200
So I'm trying to find out anyone else has had that issue. Thanks a lot, and

203
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,200
Thanks for the garlic mate. Yeah, you know

204
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,240
I think that's a strategic mistake on Apple's part

205
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,960
They open that up so that anyone can comment on the show and and I've seen this happen all over the place

206
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,520
I'm sure that it's happened to more people it's happened. It's go look at daily source code at

207
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,120
On iTunes. Oh, there's some real nice stuff there. Yeah, people using that to basically promote

208
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,040
Their show and we'll do that on any any podcast in the category so you're in the ultimate fighting

209
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,920
Championship the UFC that that's your bag and

210
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,480
People are trying to promote their own show probably off of your back. I think that's a big mistake

211
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,920
And we've had this conversation about pod show plus and pod show plus people can indeed review

212
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,240
Your show

213
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,960
But you are allowed it's your site. You are allowed to remove the review. You know, it just doesn't you know

214
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,160
It doesn't make any sense because you can't control that kind of stuff and it really sucks ass

215
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,160
So I don't think it's a way you can take it off, but I want to say I believe

216
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:35,400
100% in in what you're doing in the the ultimate fighting championship and I and I really want to invite you to join the the pod show

217
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Network so

218
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
I'll have Richard Brewer hey give you a call

219
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
That is if he's listening to the show

220
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,600
Of course, that'll be a great test. Yeah, wouldn't it if you've got a call from him or not? I'm wondering if Richard will listen

221
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,120
So I can't help you with iTunes, but I may be able to help you with a couple other things looking forward to talking to you

222
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Hey, I'm Jason from Tennessee

223
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Just listen to the

224
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,040
12

225
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,840
2006 buzz out loud from seeing that pod test

226
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,040
Need to check it out. I think a good friend college blogger is had left a message for them

227
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,160
Concerning the new apple phone and he's not

228
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,440
Discusses a voice so you might want to check it out

229
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,480
You can totally tell it's a comic strip blogger, but it's not the yeah

230
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Discuss voice

231
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,480
Okay, I'll bite he sent a longer clip of

232
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,400
of the show and and a sound clip of the the so called the guy who should be

233
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,120
Comics strip blogger who called it

234
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:41,640
Let's have a listen. Oh, we talked yesterday about the idea that people could hack into a cell phone turn on the mic and listen to your conversations without your knowledge

235
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:49,800
We talked about taking a battery out as a way to prevent that and then suppose that the only way around that would be to hide a second battery in there

236
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
That's pretty interesting actually

237
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,800
I've got to go listen to the show. I want to find out how I can listen other people's calls. This next color points out is that we missed something

238
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,480
A clue to that whole situation in our very own podcast. Okay

239
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:09,640
Hi guys, I can't believe how you felt to connect the dots on Monday's podcast. No, that's not comic strip blogger

240
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,400
I yeah sure he he made disguise as voice on this show, but that doesn't sound like him at all. Let's listen again

241
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,680
You were mentioning how we're rogue intelligence agency could manage no no no that's not CSV and besides

242
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,120
I think if he made it onto another show he'd be the first one to point it out

243
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,600
In here on your trust the UK listeners just wants to leave you a comments response. So your commitment

244
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,640
So have pod show protect the

245
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Patent of podcasting

246
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
pod specifically pod catching

247
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:50,920
I applaud your sentiments really good to hear that the hero pod show are fully behind that. Let me just bring up to speed on this

248
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,920
apparently

249
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,280
Apple

250
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
file day a patent

251
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:04,440
on the concept of automatically downloading audio programs and synchronizing them to a mobile player

252
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:14,040
Basically you know how pod casting started out and so they they filed a patent for this saying that they invented it and we all know

253
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,840
Because it was done out in the open that they did not invent it

254
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
So just bringing up to speed on what the sky's talking about

255
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,120
Through the you know getting podcasts into our chains and

256
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Who's setting up pod five on all of that

257
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,200
course

258
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:40,680
You know reach out through that relationship and see we can get get it discussed and maybe just not so we're in Apple without going through the blood sucking lawyers

259
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,840
You know everyone always seems to want to reach for the lawyers

260
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,320
And put up a legal challenge and obviously I understand why you have to do that but

261
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:58,360
I will be nice to hear that maybe you try at least try to get to an alternate channel as well and avoid getting a lawyer involved and maybe you're some sort of

262
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Gentleman's agreement in place

263
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,680
That would be good to hear so just one of what your comment on that was

264
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,880
Thanks a lot catch you later. Well, I have a way forward. Thank you. Of course you're a folder

265
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,160
I've I've two comments to make on that number one

266
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,280
This is the United States of America and once someone starts with a legal procedure

267
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,160
Which is exactly what filing a patent or patent is all about it's it's a legal document

268
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:30,840
The only way to you know ensure that you can stop that is by filing against it and and starting legal proceedings

269
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,360
I like Apple as a company. I don't want to have to go and and do all that

270
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,080
But here's here's the thing that really bugs me go to fucking wiki pedia

271
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,120
Right and look up pod casting and look at all the people who have added their names to the list as the

272
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,960
influencers and and and and and co

273
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,200
Discoverers and inventors of podcasting. Please go do that

274
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,280
And then tell me where are all these cox suckers right now? You know if you really invented podcast thing

275
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,360
Then how come you aren't all over this? I feel that I definitely contributed so I'm gonna stop that as bullshit

276
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,640
You know, and I don't want a patent at all on on on podcast, but I certainly don't want someone else

277
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,840
Who really did not contribute to the process of

278
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,840
The invention of this wonderful system that we have

279
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:27,240
I don't want them running away with it and then being able to charge anyone who wants to take this idea and and bake it into their own

280
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
software and get that bullshit

281
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
So where's the outrage?

282
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,400
I think the only the only way to do it is is is to file a legal document

283
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,320
You can basically hold up a patent for a long long time when you do that. I think it's

284
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Probably just the path of least resistance. That's what it is

285
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,680
But again, where's the outrage? I'm looking for that

286
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:54,040
I'm looking for all these people who claim and had to have co-invented this stuff and been doing it forever

287
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,080
And it was their idea in 1920 go look at Wikipedia go write all those people

288
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,880
Ask them what they're gonna do about this taking place

289
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Very curious to see what happens

290
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,240
Yeah, I'm how you doing this is Chuck from a candy pack cast in the cold city of Chicago, man

291
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,960
So you're in San San that this week that's so cool and you know, I hit you with a few AM emails

292
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,120
I was wondering if man if there's any possibility we've got

293
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:29,240
John Lennon's anniversary coming up Friday for food bar Friday on the 8th of December John Lennon's

294
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:38,360
26th anniversary of his death and me and my buddy Jay Gapner who's up on the up on the PMN and I'm actually looking man

295
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,000
It's what a great job you guys is on these I'm pod so

296
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,600
Come on the holiday list here and damn

297
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:54,200
The song is great is called a soldier's Christmas and it's in John Lennon style man and his glory and

298
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,320
If there's any way you can play fest Friday's touch

299
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Man that would be so great

300
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:09,080
Would so appreciate we cranked it up last year when when you gave us the call for pod safe music then your feed broke and you know never got played, but

301
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
And picked it up over at

302
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,840
Pod safe

303
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,120
Christmas and

304
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:25,320
I was so happy about that, but man if there's any way you could play it Friday for John Lennon's anniversary that would be smoking

305
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Adam, thank you so much, man

306
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,040
Hey, I'm also to Merrick Airlines too, so I've said you see emails from there

307
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,640
Tellings to you. I'm a folder and I got blessed man peace and wealth. Thank you.

308
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,120
Tailwinds tailwinds back at you. I presume your pots I saw the emails coming

309
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,240
I haven't read them. I saw the subject line because it said Friday food bar so

310
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,840
I figured I'd take a look at that tomorrow within this voice mail came in. Yeah, you know, I've listened that song

311
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,680
Some reason it just doesn't do it for me. I don't know. I'll listen to it again tomorrow, but I think tomorrow being the anniversary of

312
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,520
Was it what was it his birthday? I forgot what you said

313
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,600
Let me see it's probably my email was it was his birthday or was it the anniversary of his death?

314
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
No, it's got it

315
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:18,520
26 anniversary. Okay, here it is. I got your email Fridays DSC content John Lennon's 26 anniversary

316
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:26,440
Okay, hey, I'll listen to it again, but I think John Lennon would appreciate it more if we just

317
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,440
Told the man to go fuck himself and played some of his music, you know

318
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Think that would make a head of a lot more sense

319
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Feels a lot more right to me if you know what I'm saying

320
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,120
Is everybody box entry to wind up today is Charlie

321
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,800
He's in love with Goldie. Oh, I was technically a virgin back when I was 21. I had a pocket full of rubbers and a pack of

322
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,480
Bubblegum. I could spit in seven colors hit the ceiling with each one

323
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:02,440
I thought I'd be a million there by the age of 25 then it came to whistle fast before I even blinked and I thought I'd marry me a model

324
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
And I'd live a happy life

325
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,080
Born

326
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,680
Here's a come-and-go

327
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:16,520
I'm still holding on. I want to always let this go

328
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Just like Goldie home

329
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,600
So now I'm biting with the mirror and I'm losing never match
