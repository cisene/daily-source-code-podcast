northern california last time for this trip panic at the disco the only difference between

94
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,240
martyrdom and suicide is press coverage and ain't that the truth it's on the pod say music

95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,360
network brand new upload from uh panic at the disco great to have those guys on pmn hey everybody

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,480
it's beautiful in the city but as I look out over uh over the hills i see nothing but fog i'm not

97
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,600
quite sure if it's coming towards me or going away uh there's a lot of wind and now we've got

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,640
a really funky climate uh here's San Francisco you know with what comes out you know from the sea

99
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,040
and from the valleys and the hills and the mountains and the who i don't know how it works everyone

100
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,760
here seems to know i don't but man it's been beautiful it's been like eighty ninety degrees in

101
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:35,000
San Francisco it's just been fantastic and it's time for me to head back home uh yes i can't wait

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,720
for a number of reasons some of them you can guess right away but i really also besides just missing

103
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,280
my girls just because they're my girls i miss Patricia on the show i really do i need someone

104
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,920
else to bounce off of and talk to once in a while and just knowing that she's next door in the bedroom

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,800
doing her makeup in the morning when uh when i'm doing the show is enough to know that she could

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,600
walk it at any time and correct me for my miss assumptions in life so we've got a really full show

107
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,200
today um when i woke up this morning quarter six is usual i had twenty two voicemails i don't

108
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,920
know what happened all of sudden you guys turn on to the voicemail system and some good feedback

109
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,440
comments so we'll get to all of those and i've got to kind of keep it moving today because at nine

110
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,960
thirty rosy from the office is coming to pick me up i have to go to DMV that's right figured

111
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,280
what we're fixing Trinity will fix everything else um there's been really you know i think the car

112
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,040
was in Ron's name because i can't register it here because i don't have a California driver's license

113
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,320
and they say well uh you can just take the test and i don't want to take no driving test again

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:51,160
that'll suck severely i'm sure i could pass it but um so we sent away to New Jersey and

115
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,040
New Jersey said hey no problem we have a copy of your old license which of course had been expired

116
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,840
for many many years that's since we've been away uh i shouldn't i shouldn't let those things

117
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,680
expire that's just handy to have man so i i have no idea what it's going to be like at the

118
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:12,200
the California DMV here in San Francisco but we should find out and uh let's see let's get all the

119
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,520
soccer stuff out of the way right off the bat because um we have some things to clear up about well

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,760
about the name soccer first of all hey Adam it's Dave the guy who left you that yeah woo woo woo

121
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,680
message on your answering machine you didn't get it it was a hockey reference you said on Wednesday's

122
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,560
Charlie i think was the only person in America interested in hockey what went wrong there how

123
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,400
can we don't care about hockey in the US hey there's one place in America that still cares about hockey

124
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,360
North Carolina home to yours Stanley Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes yes Canada

125
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,720
Rally North Carolina is a hockey town except it and move on anyway on this whole soccer versus

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,440
football thread you said on Tuesday's Charlie yeah what should we do we have to call it soccer

127
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,240
I guess we have to i'm just gonna keep saying football you'll know what i mean well if you want to

128
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,040
avoid all confusion why don't you call it by its full name association football see back in the

129
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,840
19th century all these English public schools form their football clubs but each school played by different

130
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,800
rules some schools kicked the ball some schools picked up the ball and ran with it Cambridge school

131
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,120
for example played a soccer style kicking game with a fair catch rule you could catch the ball

132
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,720
market and get a free kick from that spot they still do that in australian and gaelic football actually

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:41,560
but i digress in october of 1863 the first meeting of the ball was held and all these clubs got

134
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,600
together and decided they wanted to play by one specific set of rules and that set of rules became known

135
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,520
as association football and some players abbreviated it to soccer in the 1880s

136
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:01,000
to help differentiate association football from rugby football okay so how do i get soccer

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,480
from association football that the the the source i got that source so sock but then what is the

138
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,720
curve come from that's what i'm that's what i'm missing i i totally take you word for but i'm

139
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,400
where's the curve they uh got rid of the fair catch rule too so there you have it the origins of the

140
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,440
word soccer by the way i happen to have a lot of this useless football trivia floating in my brain

141
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,400
so if you ever need any more history lessons about football you just let me know in the mean time

142
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,840
for the latest in american football check out days football blog dot com and if you'd rather play

143
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Canadian football hey for twenty they appreciate it dude i this is the comment that got missed

144
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,800
up the other day and uh i was my fault i guess somehow i'd uh downloaded only half of it and

145
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,520
loaded into cast blasts and it blew up so i still not quite sure where the curve comes from but

146
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,520
that is a very good uh background on on on on the rules and how we split up into all these different

147
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,920
types of football i'm just gonna keep it at football though if you don't mind because that to me

148
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,920
is the real name and if you're wondering why uh football has been so slow to catch on in the u.s

149
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,600
we had a big conversation about this yesterday at the office my theory is fairly simple the game

150
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,560
does not lend itself to commercial television you know you they play for forty five minutes at

151
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,000
minimum there's no uh look how many sports do we have now that have a television time outs

152
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,640

155
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,000
suburb of gulfed got a couple of points for you um about soccer and about snake bite

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,560
first of all soccer um the word derives from association football so there you go there's the answer

157
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,840
that one and regarding snake bite my wife Rachel asked me to let you know that in in

158
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,320
Surrey and West Sussex snake bite was banned when she was at school made illegal when she was at school

159
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,600
because the kids were drinking 10 or 11 points of this nectar at a time

160
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,600
it goes to a lemon and also you need to drink if you're drinking snake bite the classic is

161
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,040
snake bite and black which is snake bite and black current which destroys your brain

162

cheers peace of mind bye bye yeah dude appreciate it okay so I don't know if it's still banned in

166
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,640
gulfed and by the way why does your wife Rachel know so much about it huh

167
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,240
as she a party girl do you think she's still parties which you'd like to get some snake

168
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,680
bite and black with the pod father right down the road hi and this is Phil one half of the

169
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,840
soccer show podcast available from soccershout.com once again he's a quick world cup update

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,560
there's some superb games over the last few days let's start with the U.S. when Demsy last

171
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,840
up all into the back of the net I thought the U.S. would go on and win but their second half of

172
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,040
formus was just unacceptable of the calls for these three games that just didn't do enough to

173
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,280
justify moving on to the next round they definitely got some bad calls against them particularly

174
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,000
in the match against Ghana but to be honest they weren't worth it and it's good to see at least

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
one African team move through to the next round yeah I'd let's not say they weren't worth it

176
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,560
but it was a start yeah this was the first time I've seen so much excitement for

177
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,160
excuse me for football in the United States of course it worked out very well

178
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,760
with the timing because if it was in prime time would have been a huge problem as I just mentioned

179
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:55,720
with the commercials and thank goodness for ESPN too and other stations like that who carried the

180
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,920
games it all the Spanish stations who carried the games so I'm just really happy and proud of

181
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,400
our guys they you know they next next next competition they'll do even better because now they've

182
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,200
got the fans behind them I also thought Australia vs Croatia was a great game crazy refereeing

183
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,160
committed play and some good goals and one of my favorite teams Australia moving on the next round

184
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,160
as well I had to look forward to Holland vs Argentina but they pretty much cancel each other out

185
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,280
it was a bit of a disappointing game I forgot to build up but I think they were just saving

186
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,720
themselves for the next round the second round starts the side day is eight games four days

187
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,840
single elimination with overtime and penalty kicks every quiet to quickly run through the lineups

188
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,920
on Saturday we have Germany vs Sweden and Argentina vs Mexico Sunday we have England vs Ecuador

189
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:47,560
in Portugal vs Holland a Monday we have Italy vs Australia and probably Ukraine vs

190
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,960
and I say South Korea those games haven't been played yet to decide he's gonna be in that game

191
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,560
and on Tuesday we have Brazil vs Ghana and I think it's gonna be Spain vs France to finish off

192
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,840
the line up there my pick of the weekend is the game the sun sunday three p.m. eastern on ESPN

193
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,040
that's Portugal vs Holland Tuesday I think is gonna be two great games Brazil vs Ghana

194
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,880
and what I expect to be France vs Spain over at the soccer show podcast Tony and I are hitting

199
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:44,520
regarding second life on today's show at 12 o'clock SLT which is the same as Pacific Coast

200
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:53,400
time PST Pacific's so-st to time we open up the pod show island that's right been working

201
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,040
very very hard now of course you know that we've had parties every single day people have been

202
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,840
hanging out yesterday we had was the blue the blue party at the at the brothel what am I talking

203
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,960
about this is about second life the virtual world it's a it's a game you can download it's

204
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:16,040
second life dot com but what's nice about it is it's a game where well a lot of listeners hang out

205
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,040
a lot of podcasters hang out uh people get to get together and chat about stuff and do stuff

206
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,040
so uh I got pretty frustrated with just you know all the limitations of second life in general

207
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,080
the only way to really fix that is to get an island so uh got the team together let's me in

208
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,720
Brittany Brittany Mason you'll find her of course uh today at the party there's ex-dark ex-alora

209
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,160
magic squeeze magic star squeegee squeegee squeegee squeegee squeegee and we put together this

210
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,640
island and you're gonna love this place it's gonna be a great place to come and hang out we've uh

211
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,560
got a lot more control over what goes on in the land so of course the brothel move there yesterday

212
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,240
you probably saw that right after the party everything got ripped out and taken away

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,360
the palaces now there and it's it's it's the palaces been expanded it's beautiful we got swimming pool

214
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:14,040
we've got all kinds of great games Texas hold on roulette of course the podshow princesses will be

215
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,720
on the island dancing contest I'm moving there uh I think that's so I will be moving out of the

216
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,520
castle to live there not quite sure we're gonna deposit the castle there not because uh I have

217
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:33,640
a pretty nice place to live just look for the red car so it's gonna be uh it's gonna be high end you

218
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,280
know it's gonna be much much classier we have a lot more control out of keeping people out who we

219
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,800
don't want in but I think I think we're gonna have a really good time and you can also buy land

220
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:50,840
there you can rent a place uh so let's see if we can uh let's see if we can really get a community together

221
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,920
if you want any more information just to look for Brittany Mason online if I'm not online

222
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,400
and she'll be able to help you particularly when it comes to the real estate

223
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,720
oh man another chapter in my second life yeah yeah yeah yeah it's speaking of chapters in my life

224
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,760
you know that before I got the delta Sierra my my airplane I was flying helicopters

225
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,920
in fact I have about 750-800 hours on the turbine helicopters as piloting command

226
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,720
and uh it's you know so I kind of went from helicopters to uh to regular fixed wing

227
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,120
where most people go from fixed wing to helicopters and it usually happens after an experience

228
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,720
like Misha had AC how are you it's Micah from let's shoot I mean Micah I've done that before I'm

229
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,360
sorry Micah the chopper so over at LC choppers.com and uh I just want to say you

230
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,600
roadograph pilots man you guys are nuts you see my wife and I we just went to Alaska on a cruise

231
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,920
and we took a glacier tour and you want to talk about scud running and not being very far off

232
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,640
the ground and looking up out of the helicopter to see the top of mountains it was just crazy but I

233
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,200
tell you it was quite the adrenaline rush now I'm an air traffic controller over in Toledo

234
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:11,080
Ohio and we were helicopters all the time and I'm a fixed wing pilot myself with about 400 hours or so

235
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,200
but I tell you after the helicopter ride I'm seriously thinking about going back to school and picking

236
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,520
up those roado wings right on anyway take care and have a good week we'll talk to you later brother

237
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,320
and and tailwinds dude you suppose to say tailwinds how you really apply

238
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,080
yeah Micah used to have Micah's minute which was great there was him recording stuff from

239
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:38,040
from the tower as he was doing ATC in Toledo and I really loved it but I guess they they found

240
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:44,200
upon it so Micah's minute passed and now he's doing the chopper podcast which is not about helicopters

241
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:53,000
but about two wheel choppers. Let's see uh yesterday talked about uh was it yesterday talked about

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,040
hugging a long tall Lisa at the pod show HQ about me being vertically challenged oh I have not

243
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,520
alone hey Adam this is David from New Jersey call the tell you just uh working about a

244
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,840
day behind on the latest B.S.E.s. one of the shots and I'm sitting at a restaurant here on the

245
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,120
Jersey term bike and I thought I'd give you a call I too have vertically challenged just had my

246
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:26,920
20 second anniversary of this test weekend with my wife um 64 she is only five two so I kind of

247
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,800
know where you come in from bro uh was looking through my wedding album this past weekend and I

248
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,800
started the chuckle I have forgotten during the wedding they made my wife stand on a box so that the

249
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:46,040
pictures look more normal know where you come in from keep it up bye bye guys so what Patricia usually

250
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,720
makes me do is uh whenever we're going somewhere where this potential for us to be photographed

251
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,200
together for like uh newspapers gossip rags etc so usually when we're in the Netherlands because

252
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,000
it's a really the only place we ever get bothered with that stuff she'll make me walk about three or four

253
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,040
feet behind her and then if the people say oh yeah let's take a picture together and I literally

254
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,080
have to like spread my legs out I had this whole way of doing it so you can't really see what I'm

255
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,000
doing but you know particularly in perspective if people are taking pictures right from the front of us

256
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,600
so kind of like spread my legs forward and back and and just kind of squat down and that usually

257
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,080
works out okay and all the besides you know people often ask me if there's any other disadvantages

258
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,120
to such a height difference can you say pinwheel?

259
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,240
Hey Adam it's dead zero from the area of 51 group the weather middle listening to Wednesdays

260
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,520
usually sort of code your thing on that neutrality and I think you're missing this a certain amount

261
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,760
of perspective free lunch there's no such thing nobody is getting a free lunch we're oh wow this

262
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,560
is great yeah I've got like a couple uh two pieces of feedback uh to share with you regarding net

263
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,000
neutrality this is the thing that's uh coursing through the veins of the internet right now everyone

264
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,600
talking about it like we're getting ripped off SBC is gonna blow up the internet it's gonna suck

265
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,560
so I'm gonna just let you hear a couple of different sides of this and then uh hopefully give you

266
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,200
some more information all paid for that then with Google is saying a massive amount to SBC or

267
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,720
whatever the hell they're called by AT&T and whoever else who are those things these networks

268
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,040
we're paying for all that stuff to what they want they want to get get paid twice they want to

269
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,400
maximize their revenue streams they want more money more money more money more money that's our problem

270
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,400
they want to make it the glory of the internet has always been that anybody can prosper if

271
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,280
you've got a good idea and maybe some technical chops or you know somebody you can get a website

272
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,080
up and you can make a million dollars all of a sudden now you got to pay the ferryman before you

273
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,760
can actually stand a shot it's been a ruin it if you're not fair it's not legal and there is no competition

274
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,040
they're in collusion there's about three bandwidth providers that cover the United States

275
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:14,280
and everybody else is using them they're definitely all gonna charge the same amount and that

276
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,600
amount's gonna keep going up together and they're not gonna get charged as weeks as long as this

277
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,160
is made for the city office it is not going to be what you're imagining is not gonna be worked

278
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,040
out in the market there is no opportunity for anybody else to make any even networks maybe

279
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,880
she's for Google but if watch them get stopped with galleries they have a it's not a fair

280
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,600
system it's not free market and it's not a free lunch you know what are you getting it for free

281
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,360
see you later okay so this is pretty much the typical attitude that that is coursing through the

282
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,920
veins of the the internet right now that it's not fair it's double dipping there's no competition

283
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,360
now this is a subject that I happen to know an awful lot about having owned a data center

284
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,480
and really understanding how the internet itself works on the inside that's the big cloud that

285
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,840
you always see on the power points when people are talking about these great things with the

286
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,960
internet and they say on end is cloud in here all this stuff kind of happens okay so I happen to

287
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,480
know a lot about that and before I get into it I want to play more because now here's a a different

288
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,720
viewpoint on net neutrality hey and this is Chris Thompson so it helps you and he go apex of that

289
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,080
come I was just listening to so talking about net neutrality and it has two cents to offer

290
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,280
awesome Louisiana I was talking to internet engineer a network engineer who works for a

291
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:43,400
streaming media company for like music videos and got the scoop from him so basically it's all about

292
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:50,920
fiber optic um for years uh FBC and AT&T have been putting fiber optics to the nose level which is

293
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,080
you know your neighborhood so you individual neighborhoods would have fiber optic connection

294
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,880
and this this means they sent a lot of money on infrastructure and all this other nonsense

295
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,640
and the plan is to bump up everyone's bandwidth so all of a sudden now you have you know a huge

296
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,000
pipe coming at your house and they want to offer content on that they want to offer uh

297
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,640
voiceover IP they want to offer you know content distribution stuff and if they're going to have

298
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,800
competitors come and do the same thing without paying for that's that's what their beef is and

299
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:36,600
doesn't make too much sense for me um but also there was a um a bit about having this you know a huge

300
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:44,120
fiber optic pipe certain packets will also be time sensitive like voiceover IP and streaming packets will be

301
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:51,720
preferred and if your network is preferred then you just get you get right through in preference to a

302
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,520
packet which is not preferred so you know it's getting voiceover IP even better and stuff

303
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,640
and it makes very much sense you make a lot of sense if you're doing this but you basically have

304
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:10,120
monopoly over these fiber optic connections you can name your price there's not much I'll choose I mean the

305
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:17,640
telco's own the internet I mean combined um so I don't know too much about I don't know too much about

306
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:24,840
this issue but that's just my uh my knowledge that I can add to the conversation um personally I'm

307
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:31,720
looking at um getting uh dumping contest I don't have a only in my phone I want to get the um

308
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,120
the neighborhood wireless connection all right so he goes on for a little bit more and I really have

309
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,240
to stop because if you want to know all about net neutrality and you're listening to this podcast on

310
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,840
serious stars 102 you're gonna have to download the whole show a daily source code dot com to find out

311
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,120
my viewpoint on that PCH is next for you guys I'll talk to you on Monday so okay

312
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,040
I'm trying to think if I should get now you know what there's one because I did a lot of research on it yesterday

313
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:04,680
because even though I'm pretty sure that I know what I'm talking about I did go out and do some

314
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,680
more research on net neutrality and low and behold I uh found I'm trying to launch this now

315
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:19,640
I found a uh a video of uh hold on open up here we go of Tim Berners Lee the man widely credited

316
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,800
for um yeah essentially uh coming up with the concept of the worldwide web

317
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,080
you got to listen to this it's you know it's it's short but it's Tim Berners Lee

318
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,960
who I obviously high and got him in very high on the radar and on the uh respect scale

319
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,000
but I don't think he understands either quite honestly uh he did invent the worldwide web as you'll

320
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,480
hear him say in this video piece I'm just waiting for it to load or actually streaming this uh over

321
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,640
the net coming I think this is a hopeless streaming and over the net oh what is this

322
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,720
to help protect your computer windows firewall has blocks and features of this program unblock okay

323
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,960
could you please get to it it was unblock yesterday why did y'all sudden decide to block it now

324
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,680
here comes Tim here's Tim Berners Lee and listen to what he's saying this is Tim Berners Lee

325
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,520
from MIT I invented the worldwide web without having to ask anybody's permission

326
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,920
I invented the worldwide web hundreds of millions of people are using it freely today

327
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm worried that this will end in the USA I've blocked on net neutrality before

328
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,160
I'm so did a lot of other people but since then some telecommunication companies have

329
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:44,920
spent a lot of money on TV ads and PR and the US house seems to have wavered from the path

330
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,040
of preserving net neutrality there's been some misinformation spread about

331
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:01,400
so here are some clarifications net neutrality is this if I pay to connect to the net with a given

332
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:08,120
quality of service and you pay to connect to the net with the same or higher quality of service

333
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,280
then you and I can communicate across the net with that quality of service

334
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:23,640
that's all it's up to the internet service providers to interconnect to make sure that happens

335
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
and they've shown they're very capable of doing that

336
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,600
net neutrality is not about asking for the internet for free

337
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,200
net neutrality is not saying that we shouldn't pay more for higher quality of service

338
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:48,360
we always have and we always will there have been some suggestions that we don't need legislation

339
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,320
because we haven't had it these are nonsense because in fact we have had net neutrality in the past

340
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,680
and it's only recently that real explicit threats have emerged

341
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,800
control of information is hugely powerful

342
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,800
in the US the threat is that companies will control what I can access for commercial reasons

343
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,920
in China the threat is the government controls access for political reasons

344
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:25,480
there is a very strong short-term incentive for a company to grab control of TV distribution

345
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,520
over the internet even though it is against the long-term interests of the industry

346
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:41,160
yes regulation to keep the internet open is regulation and mostly the internet has thrived

347
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,320
or lack of regulation but some basic values have to be preserved the market system depends

348
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,000
on the fact that you can't photocopy money democracy depends on freedom of speech

349
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:08,120
freedom of connection with any application to any party is the fundamental social basis of the internet

350
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,120
and now is the basis of the society we've built on the internet let's see whether the United

351
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:26,120
States is capable of acting according to its fundamental values or is it as some people who have been

352
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:37,320
saying run by the misguided short-term interests of large companies I hope Congress can protect net

353
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:45,560
neutrality so I can continue to innovate in the internet space I want to go on seeing the

354
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:51,640
huge number of innovations which are happening out there and which is so diverse and so exciting

355
00:29:52,440 --> 00:30:02,120
I want to see that continue unabated okay timbernously I got a disagree with you even though

356
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,440
I hold you on high regard for inventing the worldwide web as you say yourself

357
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:15,800
you did not invent the internet we all know how guarded that and that's really what this is about

358
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,240
this is not about the web in fact you timbernously even said there you know this is about controlling

359
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,760
television through the internet which I thought was kind of weird for him to even use the word

360
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:34,760
television because we don't really have television on the internet okay what happens on the internet

361
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,640
and this is something that has been brewing for a long long time and it is not only something

362
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,000
that's that's happening in the US it's going to happen worldwide because this is about peering and

363
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,040
peering agreements when now when when when Al Gore invented the internet as basically when the

364
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,840
DARPA net was turned off and commercial networks took over the backbone functionality of the net

365
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:03,560
and we saw this happen from you know 94 95 so for the past 10 to 15 years we we yeah for the past 10

366
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,080
12 years we've literally seen this grow before our very eyes now because these were telecommunications

367
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:17,240
companies they're used to handing off phone calls to each other on a you know on a billions of

368
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:23,480
phone minutes a day I guess and they do this at exchanges and at the end of the month they have

369
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,120
something called settlement which basically is when they all the computers run and they match everything

370
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:36,920
up and they say okay I sent four hundred million minutes to you so you owe me an X amount of money

371
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,400
because I passed those phone calls off onto your network but you also passed phone calls off

372
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:47,800
on the mine network it was 490 minutes million minutes so I owe you 90 million minutes that's what

373
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:54,600
the settlement is all about now when the same wires the same fiber optics the same pipes started to

374
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,240
be used for data and as they started to you know convert that and there's all kinds of technical

375
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,520
stuff behind that but essentially the existing pipes you know just like our phone lines were

376
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:12,440
our first access to the internet there really wasn't an efficient way to track the cost and in fact

377
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,520
if that had started a long time ago then we probably wouldn't have seen the explosive growth of

378
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,440
the internet that we've seen so they came up with a concept of peering and you have these exchange

379
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,440
points and I know a lot about this because I had a data center called the data barn which was

380
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,280
directly connected to the m6 the Amsterdam internet exchange and in order to become a member

381
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,880
you have to have a certain amount of traffic for peering which means you're on peer with

382
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,120
other networks that connected this exchange this is where these networks come together and where

383
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,280
traffic is passed off so as an example the podcast delivery network the pod show runs in conjunction

384
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:59,080
with line light is really a whole bunch of data centers that have copies of the content around the

385
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:06,040
globe excuse me the other sincere moment but I'm not going to sponsor it now so since there's

386
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:13,480
not a very efficient way to count packets and people aren't used to being charged by the packet

387
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:20,120
necessarily these at these interchange points the networks basically say well I'm handing you

388
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,640
you know 500 million terabytes your hand and me 450 million terabytes it's almost the same next week

389
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,200
maybe I'll have more you'll have more so we'll call it a wash we'll call it peering and there

390
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,640
these peering agreements which are contracts which literally say that saying you can charge me money

391
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,240
I can't charge you money as long as we stay more or less within the bounds of equal traffic

392
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,560
so I'm sending as much to your network as I'm receiving from your network okay so when you look at

393
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:53,400
the podcast delivery network let's say you're on comcast okay and you want to listen to the daily

394
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:59,240
source code so you just click on a link or your iTunes or some other podcast you're like juice

395
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,840
says give me that file the file literally comes from a server that is probably only 20 feet away

396
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,600
from comcast network because it's in the same data center and because we have a peering agreement

397
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,320
between and really that's a lot of this limelight infrastructure we have a peering agreement

398
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,480
it gets sent over gets put right on to the network and this happens almost everywhere we're

399
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,880
you know so you remember we used to talk about hops how many hops away is this server from me

400
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:36,440
well what happens is if you if either side of the equation whether you have an ISP

401
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:42,600
that may not have all the all the direct connections into the exchanges because they don't have

402
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,200
enough traffic by themselves which means they're basically buying someone else's pipe into the

403
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:56,280
exchange or whether you're a content provider right who is providing the content onto those into

404
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,880
the exchange perhaps through an external ISP or such as pod shell were right in the exchanges

405
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:10,840
um I lost my train of thought this is a very complicated crap yeah so essentially you

406
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,120
request it and it comes out on the other end if if you don't have those direct connections you

407
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:23,240
have to do something which we call transit you have to buy transit so if as an example it could

408
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,720
happen although unlikely that the podcast delivery network is in exchange and there's a huge

409
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:37,560
network let's just call it SBC and they feel that for this new network they've put in place

410
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,240
which is really high speed you're not sending them enough traffic or you're not able to receive

411
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,680
enough traffic back from them for whatever reason they say we don't feel like we're peers then

412
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,560
I would have to literally buy access and it could only be a five-foot cable to a different network

413
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,240
that does have that amount of traffic but I would have to buy that connecting access to the other

414
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:08,280
network called buying transit which can become very expensive but at the end of the day the concept

415
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,960
of the internet is that no matter what happens your content will eventually get to the other end

416
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,120
it may have to go through several hops because they're peering agreements aren't in place this

417
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:25,480
has been going on for years in fact eight or ten years ago you could really tell the difference we

418
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,280
would do trace routes anyone done a trace route or you know to see oh where's this traffic going

419
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,160
through my gosh it's unbelievable this is not coming directly you know I'm in California and I'm

420
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,040
trying to get to a server in New York but I'm being routed through through Germany through Frankfurt

421
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,920
I mean that happened quite a lot and this is all because of the peering agreements or lack of them

422
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,560
and the purchasing of this transit bandwidth so because these peering agreements are basically

423
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:58,440
set on you know people shaking hands and saying I agree either party when they come to the table

424
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,840
with a new network or something and some upgrade of course has the right to say you know what

425
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,480
you want to you want to drop this stuff they could say pod show you want to drop this stuff right

426
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,360
onto our network this new high speed network which essentially will allow you to deliver television

427
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:19,480
quality images to anyone on our network that's fine but you can have to pay us for it and that's

428
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:26,360
that's what's happening it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that I can't get there through another

429
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:32,200
means but it would still cost me money I would have to buy transit to a network that did have that

430
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,560
agreement with SBC this is huge political stuff that has been going on for a long time and it's

431
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,880
not about of course at the end of the day the consumer always pays the bill for everything but it's

432
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,680
it's not about never going you're that you're not going to be able to have access in fact SBC

433
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,160
would be it would be suicide for them to say oh I'm sorry you can't get to that server because

434
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:03,880
X, Y, or Z they'll never do that this is about a much higher network which really is almost

435
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,000
not even a part of the internet it's their network so if they want to charge people

436
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,680
to peer directly onto their network then people can have to do that and if not then there will

437
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:23,560
be networks and other parties in between who will aggregate all of this traffic to come up with

438
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,680
the right peering number or whatever the agreement has to be and so maybe that maybe pod show and

439
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:35,000
Google and Yahoo would all have to get together and buy transit from different parties to still

440
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,040
get on the network you will get on the network but it's going to cost money so and this is what

441
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:46,920
I truly believe is that SBC is just saying you know we're putting billions into the ground in

442
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,800
fiber and routers and switches and all kinds of stuff if you want to utilize it with all this

443
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,200
additional traffic you're going to put on a network then you know you're no longer a peer

444
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,800
you're in fact you're overloading us so you have to pay for it but the internet is not going to

445
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,960
die because of this I'm sorry it's just not going to happen this is the thing that was supposed to

446
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:17,320
withstand the nuclear attack and still work you know and so some stupid thought that a powerful

447
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,560
party can take over if look if SBC could really really take and hold the internet hostage

448
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,040
they would have done so a long time ago when they when they actually could have done it and I don't

449
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,080
and even if if they wanted to I'm still doubt that it was possible 10 years ago to really they

450
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,720
they'll try it essentially they try to own the internet it's just not how it works

451
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:51,000
study and see how border gateway protocol works it's it's it's real high-end techy stuff but

452
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,480
personally from a from a commercial standpoint I think it's great that they've put all this

453
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,840
investment in it still remains to be seen what they're going to charge for basically hopping

454
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,520
onto their network and and making use of it if they make it to expensive guess what we're just going

455
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,720
to continue to compress our videos and keep it nice and tight and you know and then it'll just

456
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,280
progress slower so there are market forces here at work it has nothing to do with with anti-competitive

457
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:26,280
behavior and even though I was the one of the first to identify some very strange

458
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:37,160
remarks made by Whitaker the CEO of SBC corporation I just don't see the threat and I think it's

459
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,280
a lot of pile jumping that's going on and I really do know what I'm talking about so maybe we'll

460
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,880
just all check in in two years and and see if I was right but you know this is not legislation

461
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,680
is not going you think legislators understand this stuff I can barely understand what it's about

462
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,160
and I actually had a business that was in this business so I think it's just an upgrade of the

463
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,760
internet and it will probably take 10 years for all you know all parties involved all ISPs and

464
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,120
everything to shake out and reshuffle and create new pairing agreements but man if anyone thought that

465
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,080
this day wasn't coming we're pairing agreements would be busted wide open then then crazy we all knew

466
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,920
this was coming this has been something that's and these contracts are you know 40 pages deep of

467
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,960
all this crap you can and can't do I mean we've been skating on thin ice for a long long time and maybe

468
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,680
just maybe everybody's been getting a pretty free ride ever think about that it's really expensive

469
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,640
stuff we've been we've gotten used to cheap access and you know now we're paying the bill for

470
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,360
essentially but it doesn't mean that any company in my opinion that any company can

471
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:52,040
can go and hijack the internet and and make it so that individuals can't communicate or that

472
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:58,360
you can't start a service of course you can and you will get exactly what you pay for you know

473
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,520
it's not like your current standards are going to cost more it's going to cost more if you

474
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:10,280
want to jump to the next level oh hey and to be honest if that's if you know look I'm a commercial

475
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,480
guy everybody knows that and but I also love the the the the free and openness of the net and I

476
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:23,160
I've built a career on it and I've become very successful through it and I and I don't intend to

477
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:29,240
stop now so if I really was concerned you'd be hearing a whole different noise coming from my

478
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:38,280
piehole which of course is surrounded by lots of growth of hair yeah and this is really from

479
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,360
what you're talking and this is just gone about your your growth you had mentioned in the

480
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,960
day on the metro sexual moment you're wanting tips on how to groom that I don't think we're all

481
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,240
so if that's part of the deal man I think if you're going to let it grow you're going to just have to let it grow

482
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,720
no nothing no clip for no trim and none of that stuff man you're just going to have to go to

483
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:11,720
blue bush maybe that one's fire you to get off the end you get that two-man working man I don't

484
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,600
I don't think you should be driving at or anything else I think you're doing that boat to pictures

485
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:22,360
it could I do it and just let it go on there they're a little bit of rail then it stopped

486
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,360
reaching and just anybody now that's your energy that's good work bye all right man you got my

487
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,880
sexy SOGF to thank for that for the pictures of of course another update of the it's getting

488
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,080
it's getting thick and dark now that they take my picture dmv and what happens when I go back

489
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,200
to London will they let me in the country will they look at me and say this doesn't look like

490
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,680
your passport picture in fact that beard kind of makes you a kind of terrorist look and you know

491
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,680
I'm saying hi Adam this is Jeff Groucho Marx in second life what morning I got an elephant in my

492
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,000
agenda oh you got my agenda I don't know I've been enjoying listening to your story about growing

493
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,200
your beard in the pictures in 2000 I was a CEO of a public dot com and I too while waiting for

494
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,200
our new development platform to be launched announced the staff that I wasn't going to shave

495
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,400
until you guys finished and we launched and the news to say I went through many months

496
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,880
scratching and itching and looking ridiculously grubby and so finally they were ready to launch

497
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,400
and at the launch party I came out in my scrubby beard congratulated the team then I ducked off into

498
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,000
the bathroom and shaved off half my beard it came back into the room and into the party with

499
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,280
one side of my face clean shaving and the other side filled bushy and that was good for a few

500
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,320
laughs and a bunch of embarrassing pictures so you might want to consider that when you finish with

501
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:49,480
the you are impending launch and any event keep up the great work good to hear from you to

502
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,960
and see you every day and as Groucho would say that's the most ridiculous thing I have always

503
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,960
yeah you know I didn't like that too much that that comment because you know you said that

504
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,960
you were a CFO of a dot com company and it took months those are like a whole bunch of things

505
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,360
that just really didn't make me feel good at all about this whole beard thing I'm not planning

506
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:17,000
on waiting a couple of months I hope the company you were CFO of still exists so there's no bad

507
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,200
home and with this beard stuff this is really just to remind me about how much hard work is going

508
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,640
into creating this thing it's been eight or nine months people are really I mean I've been at the

509
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,360
office almost every night until anywhere between eight and ten p.m. and there's tons of people

510
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,680
still work and they're still just because they want to because they want to get this done they

511
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:44,120
want to get this out and the demand is so huge so take it for me I'm not planning on having this

512
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,480
beard for very long I'm just wary of giving and we have a date of course we have a date I'm just

513
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:56,520
very wary of giving it to anybody but believe me when I say the Patricia hates a beard she likes

514
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:03,320
the way it looks but she dislikes the way it functions and she will be giving me grief about this so

515
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:08,680
this is this is more to remind me of whatever one's going through trying to get all this stuff up

516
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,760
and going and it's going to be beautiful when you see pod show plus when you see my collection

517
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,560
in the channel guide and then you see the the pdn that's that's that's available for anyone for free

518
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:27,320

away from working um Pennsylvania from Central Pennsylvania to Philadelphia on U.S. one and the

522
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,240

523
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,440
from the TV station that I work at and that song came on and we said hey listen to this song

524
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,000
and imagine it's a video and at that moment I really woke up to listen there were two

that comments were Patricia's well because you know she's gonna be on the show Monday okay just a

535
00:47:51,320 --> 00:48:00,840
couple more bits here but oh they're very important ones shoot I'm used to using two different

536
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:11,480
computers for this stuff here we go let's try that comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip

537
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:21,960
comic strip you use the man with a plan hello madam carry as you maybe know I am a mobile phone expert

538
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:28,120
and not just because I was working three years in Finland at Nokia but because I'm writing the

539
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:34,440
bug mobile phones on the internet since 10 years and I visit personally major treasures including

540
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:41,640
the biggest mobile phone treasure in the world 3GSM so let me tell you and DSC listeners two things

541
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:49,080
firstly some wireless carriers indeed offer flat rate mobile internet where you pay on

542
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:57,560
six price without limits it is so in USA Japan Germany and East Europe but not in UK unfortunately

543
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:04,520
where still it's come and titled unlimited one gigabyte is practiced secondly I would like to say

544
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,800
that there's no oh I just got to stop you there C.S.B. you know this is so true talk about net neutrality

545
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:22,280
and bullshit my phone bill my singular bill I should say is about $2,500 a month and so Rosie

546
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:27,160
came to me yesterday said you know what are we going to do about your phone bill and I said well

547
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,280
you know crap you know this is what happens I you know we've tried two phones having a UK phone

548
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,160
than a US phone and I miss out on a lot of calls because people are calling the wrong phone number

549
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,880
this one's on that one's anyway or I got to walk around with two phones a tremendous logistical

550
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:48,840
nightmare but the funny thing is it's not the actual phone calls you'd think and I talk a lot

551
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:55,800
and I'm basically roaming when I'm using my US blackberry in in the UK but those costs are

552
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:01,640
relatively low maybe only a couple hundred bucks what is the actual charge for the charge is for

553
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:09,240
reading email it's for the bandwidth I consume reading email while overseas because yeah you get one

554
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,720
gigabyte and after that no actually you get one gigabyte if you're in the US and the same goes for the

555
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:21,400
UK by the way you get a gigabyte which is more than enough for the gigabyte okay just a gig

556
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:27,720
it's not a huge amount of data by today standards you get a gig to do your email is more than enough

557
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:36,280
for email however when you are roaming they charge you about a buck or maybe it's a buck 50

558
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:46,280
per megabyte that is transferred that's bullshit that is total crap and bullshit and it is directly

559
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:53,080
related to the peering issue and it's and but in this case it's price gouging it is totally

560
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:59,160
intended to rip off the consumer when he goes outside of the regular coverage area phone would

561
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:05,720
had this good you got as a bribe it's quite good for the recording thanks to wifi and

562
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:14,200
3G but it has no stereo audio of a bluetooth so it is missing the crucial thing anyway

563
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:20,120
and I'm carry why couldn't you give me interview about mobile phones now when you see that mobile

564
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:27,480
phone industry seriously is entering put casting let's do it made over Skype or in person come on

565
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:34,520
here you'll like that podcast creator okay see as be I don't know about interview

566
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,840
I'm not I've got nothing to say I don't know anything about mobile phones you know everything

567
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,760
about mobile phones so this Nokia N91 you heard it there from the expert in fact the guy who left

568
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,160
Nokia and does not like the company at all he says it's a pretty damn good phone

569
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,000
and I have to agree you know what thank you offer sending in all that information and emails about

570
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,480
finding the tracks so I was indeed incorrect and I guess it's just an interface issue that I

571
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:07,320
and I'm not I'm I'm blonde but I'm not totally stupid but I thought that music would be under music

572
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:13,880
but no it's under tracks okay so I found all the tracks that came pre-loaded on this N91 which is

573
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:22,120
as CSB just said I received as a bribe to talk about it yeah hell yeah let me see let me see

574
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,960
if I can find it here because they pre-loaded it with all kinds of cool stuff is he Kevin Reeves in

00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:41,320
couch or something to say hey what's up it's Marcus couch pot show music rewind and the scene's

590
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:48,600
aim and I'm actually calling to talk about rewind right now hey if content clips were you know

591
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:55,080
recreational activities I'd be down to sticks and stems right now are you music podcasts is up there

592
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:02,280
point your browser to rewind dot pot show dot com click on the submission tab on the right side

593
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:10,200
and give me a clip just send it to hot show music rewind and gmail dot com and you're in

594
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,080
it could be on the show totally appreciate that hey speaking of appreciate and thanks for the link

595
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:23,800
to the scenes video podcast yeah my pleasure man plugbell here the scenes theme dot com totally

596
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:29,320
appreciate that and I'm actually going to two more in the can and each one is like technically

597
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,520
harder than the last so having a lot of fun doing that but I tell you it's a lot different than

598
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:40,360
audio because instead of just hitting the play button to listen to the thing it takes about 20 minutes

599
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:48,600
to render every 30 seconds video to all about it the time shifting is definitely a huge lag factor

600
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:54,200
in video podcasting all right Marcus couch monitor you know all right buddy if you haven't seen

601
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,480
that I put a link on curry dot com yesterday to uh Marcus couch's video podcast I you got to see

602
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,280
what he's done it's fantastic it's really really cool great use of the medium but yeah it's not

603
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,600
that it's not trivial it's not like audio where you bang them out one after another you know it's uh

604
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:15,960
it takes actual work involved yeah we've been doing some stuff for for the show over in uh in England

605
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,440
for for BT uh sorry I'm supposed to talk about that I'm supposed to tell you who are partners

606
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,280
for a hot show UK for a big launch it's going to be great we've been putting lots of cool

607
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:34,440
video stuff together finally um just uh quickly regarding my uh temporary switch to windows

608
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,640
first of all all the people who say that I shouldn't be getting a Sony via because of the route kit

609
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,520
fiasco you're probably right but I'm just a dumb consumer and I just want a really good machine

610
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,200
so I can still hate Sony for doing that but yeah people and companies make mistakes

611
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:58,760
so it is also divine to uh to forgive particularly if you get a great kick-ass computer out of it

612
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:07,560
but I was missing really I I'm not missing much on on on how it works and how it functions you know

613
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,840
and of course the beauty of the of a Macintosh is that the hardware and the software are pretty much

614
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,720
tightly controlled by the same company so they you know it's like you know there's only so many

615
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:23,880
types of monitors that are going to be hooked up to it so you know uh uh the the operating system

616
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,120
knows exactly what capabilities the uh how many people you how many people how many if you're looking

617
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,360
at well listen to this on your computer just look down to see if you receive the Skype message

618
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:39,240
that's Raymond Ford's Skyping Me Raymond I'm in the middle of the show um so you know there's

619
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,480
there's there's there's we don't have that tight integration on windows so there's some things that

620
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,800
you know that that are just a little funky but the one thing I've really been missing

621
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:54,360
is the ability to do an apple key age which is hide and that came out with OS 10 I don't think it was

622
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,320
even in the uh in the initial release or maybe if I recall correctly it was in the initial release

623
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,160
and they took it out of the second release and then brought it back because people love it so much

624
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,560
and it's nice because it's control which is the left-hand side of the keyboard and age which is right

625
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,520
in the middle so you can tap that with the have long-hand long fingers so I can tap that with one hand

626
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,400
or I can use my other hand it's and I become accustomed to it for you know six years now

627
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,160
I've been using control age as control age all-tab that's kind of my the way I navigate around

628
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,280
and it's just nice to control age to move something out of the way if you want to have it back

629
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:32,920
and all-tab and it's back and uh I've been looking for the equivalent of that and I of course

630
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,000
receive lots of email and a and a voicemail feedback about how to do that.

631
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:46,440
Hey Adam how's it going this Kevin reads uh and a couple quick things first of all um an easy way

632
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:53,000
to do hiding in windows with a keyboard and unfortunately it's a two-step process but it's a lot

633
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,640
of easier than what you've been doing is when you're in an application hit alt space and then

634
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:07,240
and for minimize it's kind of weird you'd think it was M but it's not it's November

635
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:13,480
so alt space and then N that will minimize the application and bring it to the next one

636
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,920
so that's that's the first thing second thing and then he goes on to talk about being on the

637
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:24,040
Nokia phone which already mentioned thank you Kevin so yeah that's not very handy because it's

638
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,760
two-step process this is all about speed you know by the way um you know how you may have

639
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:36,360
used spotlight on the Mac to find something or I used uh was it quick keys or quick silver quick silver

640
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:42,120
I think it is uh which gives you a quick short cut command you type in the first couple of letters

641
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,880
of whatever it is you're looking for whether it's a document or an application that's the way

642
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,240
I don't navigate you know to my applications folder or down to the dock you know I like using the

643
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,080
keyboard my hands are already there I don't have to move it away from the mouse it's all about

644
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:00,360
the speed of navigation for me shoot I'd probably be one if I could if I ever learned e-max I'd

645
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:06,120
probably still be using e-max I definitely still pop open a VI editor once in a while

646
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,400
but it's not it's not the same thing so I really wanted to control H and Anders Kerson

647
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,240
I thought hope I'm pronouncing that right heard the call and he created a beautiful little

648
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:24,040
application for me you just drop a shortcut into the startup folder and it's hidden you don't see it

649
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:30,200
and it basically maps control key and the H key that combination or any other combination you

650
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:36,040
want you can reset it it basically maps that to the minimize the foremost application command which

651
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:42,200
would be the equivalent to the alt space bar and then the n which is nuts it's the n for no

652
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:49,320
member I mean how stupid is that minimize hmm let's make that an n command they must have had a

653
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:54,760
long meeting and redmin about that shit so anyway Anders thank you so much I love this new app and

654
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:01,080
if you think it's bug free dude I think you should totally put that out there and let people enjoy this

655
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,520
use max and also use windows and just missed that one little wonderful piece of functionality

656
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:13,400
I think they'll be very cool and again I really really do appreciate you putting that together for me

657
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:21,000
dang we've been at it for an hour I got to get to the dmv and even better I got to go home

pod safe music network and send me an email about it and said, hey, what do you think?
