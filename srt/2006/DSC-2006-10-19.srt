00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You've flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,320
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Available now on DVD.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Adam, well, stranded in Cleveland.com, and I'm getting really sick of thinking about you every time I wipe my arms.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
This is Daily Source Code Number.

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,320
481, $16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,320
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,320
I can't believe what you said.

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,320
I think it's driving me mad.

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Because all the time that we spend, doing the things that we train, the stories come to an end.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,320
You say you gotta meet, if I wanna tell you please, don't treat another good job.

17
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,320
If you treat me, I don't want you to stay.

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,320
I want you to come out and weigh and weigh and weigh and weigh.

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,320
I just have to say what's wrong with you and make me blue.

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Since I do, the love is gone on earth.

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,320
I just pity, day and day again until the end.

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:24,320
I can't stop because they know I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm baby and I'm

I Just City day and again until the end

25
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,540
That's like the double class

26
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,260
There's no what they need

27
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,660
I play it a play

28
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,200
I make it a play

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
All the time

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,880
Then it goes on day

I've done it, it's got something

42
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,100
And it was so weeping

43
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,460

Send me by Jersey Todd

51
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,500
for a little midweek cowbell boost.

52
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,060
Thanks Todd, I really appreciate it.

53
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,100
Yeah, there you go.

54
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,100
Cowbell on a Thursday.

55
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,140
Hey everybody, how you doing?

56
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,700
Coming to you from a very sunny Northern California

57
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,020
from the Curry Condo in San Francisco.

58
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,500
It is the daily source code episode 481.

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,460
You could tell from the kind of generic opening,

60
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,740
I need some more openings.

61
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,860
Send them on, please.

62
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,020
Adam and poncho.com.

63
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,260
Me or in the end of the trip.

64
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,460
And I'm feeling much better today.

65
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,660
I got up a little bit later than normal 630.

66
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,740
And these days, it's kind of hard not to wake up early

67
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,860
because this memory told you that if I look up my window

68
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,180
and I look out at the bay, which, of course,

69
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,220
is, I've got such a view.

70
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,820
I've got such a great bachelor pad.

71
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,860
I've got everything I need, it's a bachelor in here.

72
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,740
Every single thing except girlfriends, the clean and cook for me.

73
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,460
So I used to have the Bank of America tower right outside

74
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,180
which reached up about, I'm on the 24th floor.

75
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,220
So it was probably 20th floor or something like that.

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,540
So I could just look over it.

77
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,940
Hey, San Seo with some nice vanilla splendor, everybody, I do.

78
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,820
And they've started building this thing called one rinkin' hill.

79
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,500
One rinkin' hill.com.

80
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,260
It's going to be two towers.

81
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,740
And I really, and I can see now that they're just about as high

82
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,900
as the Bank of America tower was.

83
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,140
And I was riding up the elevator yesterday.

84
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,340
And, yeah, yesterday after work.

85
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,660
And, you know, it's a guy in the elevator

86
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,100
and we get the chatting a little bit.

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,220
Yeah, I got to go up to 24.

88
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,740
So he says, have you heard about one rinkin' hill?

89
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
I said, what do you mean?

90
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,580
He says, well, it's apparently, 90% sold out.

91
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,660
He says, oh, that's interesting.

92
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,020
I said, you know, how high is this thing going?

93
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,500
It says 59 stories.

94
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,420
It's supposed to be the tallest building west of the Mississippi.

95
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,980
I'm like, well, it's going to be two towers.

96
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,740
Yeah, two towers, 59 stories each.

97
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,140
I'll have absolutely no view whatsoever.

98
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,380
I'll have no form of pay for you.

99
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,180
It's going to be gone.

100
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,700
Oh, man.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,780
So what amazes me?

102
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,780
And I've never seen this, and I've lived in a lot of countries.

103
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,780
But the work starts here at 5 a.m.

104
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,060
That's when they start building.

105
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,660
And, you know, so, of course, you can hear some of it.

106
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,900
It's just across the way, you know, they got,

107
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,740
they're pouring concrete and lifting steel.

108
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,740
And they do not stop until 10 p.m.

109
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,620
Unbelievable.

110
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,300
The rigor that goes into this.

111
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,380
Yeah, in most countries, I don't think you could do that.

112
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,820
I think it's illegal to work that long on that.

113
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,940
Imagine getting that done in France, huh?

114
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,700
Well, you're 35 hour, 35 hour work week, lazy French bastards.

115
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,020
Hmm.

116
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,340
Okay, stuff to talk about today.

117
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,620
I wrote a couple of things down, stuff that I wanted to mention.

118
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,740
These are just some general things that I caught on the six hour jet

119
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,940
blue flight from New York to Oakland.

120
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,980
And I just want to say a lot of people sent me email about jet blue.

121
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,260
Yeah, jet blue really does rock.

122
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,820
And I forgot to make one more comparison about jet blue.

123
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,740
It is so much like the Concord, except for the speed, obviously.

124
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,580
It's not funny.

125
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,860
The Concord had a very, very similar type of layout, kind of, you know,

126
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,660
for the, you know, these jet blue seats are wide enough

127
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,820
that they actually equal what you'd get on the Concord.

128
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,740
And the Concord, you had really nice, you know, nice legroom.

129
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,300
You couldn't stand up straight in the Concord.

130
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,860
There was no television, no movies on the Concord, basically because the flight was so short,

131
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,860
you know, by the time you got started that have to, you know,

132
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,540
at the hand your head sets back in, and we'll get warm in the cockpit and everything.

133
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,380
Yeah, of course it was a thrill to fly the Concord.

134
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,260
Did it a couple times, but jet blue, except for the speed, rivals it completely.

135
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,980
So anyway, so they give you 36 channels of, of direct TV.

136
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,220
So there's got a little dish on top of the plane.

137
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,940
And so I watched a lot of television, I really did.

138
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,340
And I was able to basically sit through all six hours without freaking out.

139
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,380
I could find something at least somewhere on one of the channels.

140
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,100
And I saw some entertainment shows come by and two things that caught my eye.

141
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,340
One is Wesley Snipes. What is going on with that?

142
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,820
Wesley Snipes now being sought.

143
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,300
There's a warrant out for is a rest of for back taxes that he owes.

144
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,700
How can you mess that up, dude?

145
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,540
If you, and he owes like $15 million in taxes, you got to make a lot of money to

146
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,220
$15 million in taxes.

147
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,180
So I don't know if they've found him yet, but this is, you know, kind of atypical for Hollywood celebrity.

148
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,100
So watching that story very closely.

149
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,140
And all, you know, New York State taxes trying to nail me.

150
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,940
This has happened, uh, this has happened four or four years ago.

151
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,660
All of a sudden New York State sent me a letter and said, oh, you owe us, uh,

152
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,900
I don't know, something like $1.7 million.

153
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,340
There's some crazy amount like that.

154
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,460
And I said, you haven't lived in New York since 1987.

155
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,260
I lived there for one year, you know, what do you after?

156
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,500
Apparently I had a, I had a mailing address.

157
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,660
After we moved from, uh, from the states to back to Europe, I had a mailing address in New York,

158
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,020
which was basically, um, and a former employee, her, um, her apartment.

159
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,020
And so I had to prove that that, you know, that I did not live in New York.

160
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,940
And I had actually lived in New Jersey and we had sold the house and we had bought a house in Amsterdam

161
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,340
at the time. And it cost me about $10,000 in lawyers fees to prove it.

162
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,060
And now they come back. They've actually checked this. They've put out a warrant on me,

163
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,180
New York State for like $48,000. Not a warrant for my arrest, but you know,

164
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,340
I guess should I have tried to sell anything property wise or, I don't know,

165
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,380
maybe they will arrest me if I tried to re-enter the country.

166
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,980
Uh, and so now, you know, I've had to send off another $2.5,000 check to the lawyers to go and

167
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,060
figure it out, just to prove that I, you know, there's no way you can't tax me if I,

168
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,820
if I haven't lived in New York State. So, uh, so who knows what mean, what made you going on with

169
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,780
Wesley Snipes? We've got to figure it out. And the other one that I, this is, I just love this story.

170
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,140
Steve Winn, who's a major major mogul in Las Vegas, uh, he owns the, yeah, what the

171
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,900
Bellagio and I guess the, does he have a Steve Winn hotel now? Whatever it is, uh, apparently he'd

172
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,420
been working, you know, in the Blagio, if you've ever been there, has filled with beautiful paintings.

173
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,460
And, uh, I guess he was spent a long time trying to get hold of this one particular Picasso for

174
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,940
like 130 or 140 million dollars. And, uh, so he finally got the, the painting. And I believe it was the

175
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,340
same day, maybe the day after it, he's showing this painting off to people. And he makes some kind of

176
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,700
weird move, and he pokes a hole in the fucking painting with his elbow. 140 million dollar per

177
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,740
castle. Fantastic. Of course it's all shareholder money, but still, just a great story.

178
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,620

182
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,860
photo. Bye. Choose. Who's got Duncan? Not a good initiative there from our German colleagues.

183
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,740
Very cool. A couple of people said, and I've received this before, maybe it's now heating up.

184
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,180
We are not being in the UK. I can't really track it all that well, but, um, there's now a

185
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,580
word, and I guess this is coming from partially from the UK, but also from the European Union.

186
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:47,220
There is a draft proposal regarding, quote, television on the internet. On the internet,

187
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,780
it's on the series of tubes, and what they, uh, and I don't have, I've not seen the draft

188
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:01,780
proposal, but apparently there's some folks who want to regulate video on the internet,

189
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,260
the same as television is regulated. Now, in the UK, by the way, there are already some laws

190
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,540
that carry over to the, uh, to the internet regarding safety of children, and, uh, there's one other.

191
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,380
I guess you can't threaten to kill someone. Something like that. So it's a little more restrictive

192
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,260
than, uh, than the free speech that we enjoy in the United States, but not much. But now there's this,

193
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,860
and I mean, you know where this is coming from? You know, this is coming from scared media companies

194
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,500
who have some kind of cloud inside the EU, or was it, you know, some of these ministers are

195
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,540
parliament or whatever. It's like, I think the quote was really good. If it looks like television,

196
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,020
if it feels like television, and it smells like television, it probably is television, and even

197
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,220
if it's on the internet, it should be regulated like television. And like, whoa, that's pretty big.

198
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,300
Now, I'm sure that this is never going to pass. This will never become law, but it is kind of

199
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,140
interesting. People are sending me, I'll put a link to, uh, to one of these stories about it. I guess

200
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,060
the, uh, the times in the UK did, uh, the story about it. I've seen this story around,

201
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,340
seems like something that's very, very hard to police to me. And it just doesn't make sense.

202
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,940
I would definitely revolt against that. And that's crazy. Absolutely crazy.

203
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:18,100
Uh, you know what, can you just bear with me one second? I got to have a crap. I've got, uh,

204
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,140
the, uh, the shades here. The sun is now coming in. I can no longer see my computer screen,

205
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,100
because I'm at the Baker's Rock. I, you've probably seen the picture of the set up before.

206
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,220
So all that. I just got a plug in the, I don't have enough outlets. I don't have enough outlets for

207
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,500
all the gear that I'm packing here. So I have to unplug one one a second. So I can plug in the, uh,

208
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,700
the window blinds. They are automatic. There you go. Oh, much better. It's starting to,

209
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,140
I was starting to perspire just a little bit. Okay, and let me plug the computer back in.

210
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,940
Oh, man. I'm so ready to go home. I miss my girls.

211
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,700
Interesting voice mail is coming in. I don't know how this happened, but for some reason now these,

212
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,260
uh, these two numbers, the plus one two one sixty five six three five seven and then the, the,

213
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,660
the UK number, which I can't remember off the top of my head, but it's on daily source code.com.

214
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,380
People are now basically using that as a voice mail to get a hold of me. You know,

215
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,380
which, of course, is really dangerous because we'll play your shit on the air if you use that to call me.

216
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,300
And even though we've been gone for two years from the Netherlands, have not appeared on

217
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,980
anything media-wise in, in the Netherlands at all. No interest. No reason.

218
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,780
I still get calls. It's been a show. Can I come from the data chain for Adam Curry? Oh, check this.

219
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,860
Those of you who are Dutch listeners, you'll probably get a kick out of this.

220
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,860
And we'll meet in a black-nix program that you did to make a mark before someone's making an investment show.

221
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,660
A television show about investors.

222
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,780
At your zeven, um, a pair of lighting interview, uh, not shut the fuck out.

223
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,260
How stupid are they? Why what I want to be on your show about investing?

224
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,180
I'm not interested in that.

225
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,140
It's not wasting my valuable bit time.

226
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,620
Here's something closer to home. Adam Curry was happening. It's a month. It is 7.30 and I am an

227
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,460
onsu in the NISO Hotel. I hope you can come down and join me.

228
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,500
Now, is that, does that mean that monk is in San Francisco?

229
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,700
Let me say.

230
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,460
Ah, to be called to come up. Okay, so I at least is his cell phone number.

231
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,500
Monk, what are you doing, man? I want to, if you think that I'm in New York or if he's in San

232
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,220
San Francisco, dude, you gotta drop by the office today. We're gonna, we'll have some fun for sure.

233
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,780
And, uh, and this was one that I've been waiting for. I've been waiting for someone to comment on this.

234
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,180
I have been love the fact that we've got 24 minute segments.

235
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,740
I am much, much preferable for any four-minute long segments,

236
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,580
feelable again. Much, much, much easier this week to finish my listening day.

237
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,700
But I thought for the first to play trials, which were a bit shorter.

238
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:29,620
You know, I don't know, a lot of empty trees, one of the zones to play 90-minute long track

239
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,300
and that would get through it. There was a variety of tracks that I've become in this long.

240
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,260
So, I, with my say, I absolutely prefer the split-out deal-more games.

241
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,780
Um, yeah, that's a blessing on this way. It's worth not had anyone saying how great it is.

242
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,700
Really, really, I do much, it's very much the spirit. Thanks for adding.

243
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,820
So, this is indeed something that's been an ongoing discussion about, uh, if you've never heard

244
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:59,380
the Gilmore gang, go to Gilmore gang.podshow.com, G-I-L-L-M-O-R gang, Gilmore gang.podshow.com.

245
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,380
Steve Gilmore does a weekly, I'd say I just like a chat, a conference call with, um, uh, industry-pundits,

246
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:12,420
media analysts, not media analysts, the technology analysts, I was the only media analysts.

247
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,820
And, um, you know, there's some interesting people on there. Uh, like Arlington,

248
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:27,140
uh, from TechCrunch, Jason Calicanas, Weblong Zinc, and AOL, and Netscape. Um, uh, there's always a,

249
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,620
you know, uh, Dan Farber, Dana Gardner, uh, there's always interesting, really, I enjoy listening

250
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,620
to the show. And what Steve has been doing for the past, God, I don't know, months and months and

251
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:43,460
months is splitting this up into, uh, segments of, you know, 24, 25 minutes, and then releasing them.

252
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,540
And they, of course, they come out on the feed and reverse order. So, you get the end of the show.

253
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:53,780
First, if you listen to it in, in, in that chronological order, and I've found it rather confusing,

254
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,500
uh, and there's been a lot of debate about it, you know, should you cut, you know, I think we've

255
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,900
been through this with Joseph Jaffee. I don't like it when you cut shit up like that. But at the, of course,

256
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,020
there is no necessarily no right or no wrong, and it's up to Steve to treat his audience over.

257
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,220
He wants to treat him. So this is a happy audience member. And I know I've talked about this

258
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,900
particular show, uh, earlier this week, maybe, yeah, earlier this week, where, um, we talked a lot

259
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,900
about Pod Show, we talked a shitload about Splendid. That was pretty amazing. It was just so,

260
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,500
so fun to hear that the, the Splendid vibe has been, uh, has been cruising throughout, uh,

261
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,540
throughout the network, and everyone's very aware of it. Um, but Jason Calcana's, who I know from

262
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,660
uh, our previous company, when Ron and I had a think new ideas, uh, which, that was a huge company.

263
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,820
It was like 700 people, and we were, we were publicly listed in a, it was a fantastic time. We were

264
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,740
based in New York, uh, the days of Silicon Valley. And Jason Calcana's actually, um, uh, founded,

265
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,980
I guess the Silicon Valley reporter. So, you know, we, we've known Jason for a long time. And, uh,

266
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,100
uh, you know, wherever, in the same time, we will hook up and try to have coffee or drink or something

267
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,980
like that. We exchange ideas from time to time. I mean, I think he's, um, there's a lot of the same

268
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,980
DNA there. Uh, he's an obsessive folder I found out. So that's kind of cool. Uh, but he did something

269
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,500
on the most recent guilt go more going, that I just wanted you to hear. Uh, he did an, an Adam

270
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:23,300
Curry in, in impersonation or impression. Um, and, uh, well, listen for yourself, make your own decision.

271
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,980
But, uh, I couldn't stop laughing. Miami shells. You know, why are you doing that YouTube? And then

272
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,780
boom, it's like, why comes up, it's like, stop it, you know, stop. You send me that Jason. I want to see

273
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,860
that. That's great. So class. All right. Well, don't be so nice to each other because of the

274
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,900
destroyers. Oh, man. Adam. Yeah. Adam and I are, uh, uh, a good, good pass. I know. I've heard

275
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,980
that's why I can bust the balls a little bit. Well, certainly you knew that coming in didn't just

276
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,620
see. Uh, well, you know, you told me that two days ago. I'm, uh, you know, I can't do it already.

277
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,380
The most is my Adam Curry invitation. I, uh, dude. Um, you got to do it. All right. Let's do it. Well,

278
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,780
it wasn't an impression or impersonation. It's an invitation. There you go. Right out on it.

279
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:09,540
With $400 million of airplanes trapped to my ass. It was a big side of reaper in my mouth.

280
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:15,300
And slender being snorted up my nose. I feel like I'm flying into a billion dollar market cap.

281
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,340
Why? When the credit card is, hey, my daughter is going out with this guy. He's, we don't do

282
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:26,740
show. Ping-pow. Hey. Football is screwed up. Big time, lost a domain. But hey, what are you

283
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,300
going to do? And let me tell you something, Joseph Jacky, you're my bitch boy. Ben Dover,

284
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:40,100
we're out fold and crunchy for you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm pod. Say if music network

285
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,860
come to live. I'm a Gary Gasville Curry condo. Curry condominium. Curry mode. Great

286
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:59,140
day, man. Curry coppid. Yeah. I'm crying. Oh, you know, back in the 80s, I was hanging out

287
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,260
with, you know, a mega desk. And we were on the plane and like, everybody was really fucked up.

288
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,180
You know, Phil Collins came in and I mean, Phil, we're talking to you. Phil and I used to hang out all the time.

289
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,700
It's got crazy coke addict. It was insane. Phil and I, we were doing coke from literally.

290
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,700
The bathroom in the back of the G4 all the way up to the pilots. And the pilot, he was doing coke

291
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,700
right across the dashboard. I'm telling the G5. We had to get, we had to get rid of fuel because there

292
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,900
was so much cocaine that we snored. We had to drop fuel. And, yeah, that was the 80s. You know,

293
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,260
and that was the Zinvot MTV is, you know, MTV. I don't even get invited to the 30 years.

294
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,020
But let me tell you something. There was so much cocaine in MTV. It looked like it was Christmas

295
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,620
in Miami all the time. And I was, yeah, when the real world happened and we called it the real

296
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:54,100
coke. It was the real coke world. I mean, that's basically what it was. And that was great. It was great.

297
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:01,700
And that's a little bit of that MTV. I'm telling you right now. Hey, it's my wife. How you doing, honey?

298
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:08,020
I'm all going to be a fan later. Seriously. I know what? My floppy ass. I can't take it anymore.

299
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,140
So flabby. And I'm getting no sex from my wife. And we put it in a bid for another castle.

300
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,420
And I know you guys are broke. But I'm buying my 16th home. And I'm just going to open an ass

301
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:26,580
because I can only fit four cars in the garage. And I'm trying to convert my neighbor's house into a 16

302
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,660
car garage. And it's a real pain in the ass. My life's terrible. It's terrible. I'm spending my venture

303
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:38,500
capital on $16,000 around trip virgin elite air ticket. And, you know, virgin elite air.

304
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,860
Let me tell you something. It's fantastic. UPNs will never experience it. No, it's private aviation

305
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,500
like I do. But let me tell you something. I know you want to live by characters for me. They serve

306
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:55,380
you. Good dive a chocolate. And it's sprinkled with cocaine. I'm not a virgin Atlantic double elite.

307
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,700
I was up there with Richard Branson. It was great. So it was great to Branson. I would hung out a

308
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:11,220
lot in the 80s. I was great. I'm not saying that my life went downhill after the 80s. But

309
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,980
you say that nobody's life would be what the 80s work. Because he was crazy. It was crazy.

310
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,740
Mega death. I'm telling you poison. Those guys. Holy cow. Mega death. I'm poisoning us.

311
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,780
We used to have crazy crazy crazy times. Crazy times. It was like the first life that

312
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,900
lives it. I was there, you know. It was the first life it. We were there. We're backstage.

313
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,260
Be a white Aussie, Sharon. We're having a great time. Do you mention I know Aussie and Sharon?

314
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,980
Absolutely. Fantastic. I was on Aussie's plane back in 89. He hasn't returned my goal since.

315
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,460
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. There were some other fantastic moments in that Gilmore gang. You

316
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,900
should definitely check it out. If you're on a serious star's 102, we have another three and a half hours

317
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,780
of awesome stuff coming your way on the pod show on series today. If you're listening to the

318
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:04,420
podcast, when you're in luck because we got more stuff. Yeah, we got lots more stuff. No, I don't know

319
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:12,980
a second. Oh, man. I love that. Let me see what I was going to tell you. I think we're

320
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:19,380
continuing with another season of Shadow Falls. That's cool news. But I know we're going to have

321
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,620
a call with the Mark Yoshimura and him cough today. There's all kinds of ideas. It's guys full of

322
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:29,300
fucking ideas. I'm going to do some of that. What else are we doing? Working on some video streaming

323
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,420
stuff that I'm going to tell you about probably next week, end of next week. I'm actually

324
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:39,780
been testing some stuff. If you go to curie.com, you can find a link somewhere that has a, that's a

325
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,500
test link. It's just a test. Okay. So just just to see kind of some of my, some of the ideas were

326
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:53,780
working on. And in the big UK launch, first or second week of November, that's on the horizon.

327
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:01,460
And, and also a refresh, well, refresh, I can overhaul a pod show plus. There's a lot of cool stuff

328
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:09,300
that we're doing. And, you know, nothing I can show you this week. Excuse me, send it. Say it with some

329
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:15,220
splinter. But I definitely will be able to talk a little bit more about it next week as some things

330
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:23,060
have firmed up. It's just cool stuff. Very, very excited. All right, what was this? Oh, check this out.

331
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:32,180
This is a young polette master. I'll tell you about it after the song. It's like bad 80's pop remix

332
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,060
something listenable.

333
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:32,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

334
00:27:32,180 --> 00:28:02,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

335
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,180
And maybe at a silent floor

336
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,180
I'm having four districts

337
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Why choose red lights all the time before

338
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Who just wants to switch to the junction

339
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,180
I've got to get you

340
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,180
You're on maybe at a silent floor

341
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Why choose red lights all the time before

342
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,180
Giving an amulet on a blind

343
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,180
So where did I let your skin shine

344
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,180
Why hold back why try to find it

345
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Take this tension

346
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
My kids are like kids

347
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,180
So you're right to have some fun

348
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:57,180
And the touch of the sunshine

349
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,180
My queen of the night

350
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,180
The world you're real alive

351
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:15,180
The night you blow my mind

352
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,180
No tied generation seduction

353
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,180
You can find that on the pod save music

354
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,180
Now work that as a project

355
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,180
A mastering project done by young poet

356
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Long time listeners of the Charlie will know that young poet used to do the hit test

357
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Which of course I had to stop doing

358
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,180
When we went completely pod safe

359
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,180
I love doing those hit tests

360
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,180
Young maybe we should do just one more

361
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,180
Just to reprise you know

362
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
I'm sure we could get away with one

363
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Just to remind people how cool it was

364
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,180
And how cool it could be if we could actually play

365
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
Some of the older songs from our yesterday year

366
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,180
You know the soundtrack to our lives

367
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,180
So young is now apparently the business of mastering stuff

368
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,180
It's pretty cool this is from the UK

369
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,180
No tied generation

370
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,180
As I said it's been like really bad 80s pop

371
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,180
But it sounds cool and new and fresh

372
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Thank you very much for sending me that to sending that to me young

373
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,180
Give me a call 201 65657

374
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,180
That's a plus one

375
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
If you got yourself on put the plus in first

376
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,180
So if you travel outside the country's borders

377
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,180
You can still call into the Charlie 201 65657 in the UK

378
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,180
In London, O2O 766113753

379
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Alright tomorrow will be food bar Friday

380
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Hopefully an assur-size from Amy Mack

381
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
I have not seen anything show up today

382
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,180
And I didn't hear any knock at the door

383
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,180
So hopefully I'll have that

384
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
And of course I'm sure our musicologist

385
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,180
Jersey Todd will check in with a couple of cool tunes

386
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,180
To roll out for you

387
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
And then I'll be going home

388
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
I'm very very ready

389
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,180
It's been a shitty shitty two weeks

390
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,180
A lot of fun, a lot of productive stuff

391
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
A lot of good things, business wise

392
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,180
Fun with everyone, good to see everybody at the office

393
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,180
But I felt like absolutely fucking crap

394
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,180
So I can't wait to get home and be pampered

395
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,180
He's been promised to me

396
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
Talk to you, everybody, for Food Bar Friday

397
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
Take care

398
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Another pod show podcast

399
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,180
Stick it in your ear

400
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,180
Oh wait man

401
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Almost forgot that, that's pretty damn important

402
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,180
Get this pod cast and more great ones like it

403
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,180

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,180
From pod show and lime light networks

405
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,180
I love it
