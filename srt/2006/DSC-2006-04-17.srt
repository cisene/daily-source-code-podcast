00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We're talking on the phone.

184
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're talking on the phone.

185
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We're talking on the phone.

186
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We're talking on the phone.

187
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We're talking on the phone.

188
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We're talking on the phone.

189
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We're talking on the phone.

190
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We're talking on the phone.

191
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We're talking on the phone.

192
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We're talking on the phone.

193
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We're talking on the phone.

194
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We're talking on the phone.

195
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're talking on the phone.

196
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're talking on the phone.

197
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We're talking on the phone.

198
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We're talking on the phone.

199
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're talking on the phone.

200
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We're talking on the phone.

201
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We're talking on the phone.

202
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We're talking on the phone.

203
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We're talking on the phone.

204
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're talking on the phone.

205
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We're talking on the phone.

206
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're talking on the phone.

207
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We're talking on the phone.

208
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We're talking on the phone.

209
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We're talking on the phone.

210
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We're talking on the phone.

211
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We're talking on the phone.

212
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We're talking on the phone.

213
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Jim's big ego compares itself to such major players as the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canyon and Artica and other things you can see from space.

214
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
However, when pressed to label their music,

215
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
they name their genre of music on pop for the unpopulous.

216
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Like a lot.

217
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Think about eight or nine tracks up there right now.

218
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
With some great title such as,

219
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They're everywhere.

220
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Better than you.

221
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Cut off your head and asshole.

222
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, did I mention this show is not family friendly?

223
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Or usually isn't very family friendly?

224
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey, everybody.

225
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hope you had a great weekend for some of you in Europe today.

226
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's actually a holiday.

227
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a bank holiday in the UK.

228
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I believe, which means banks are closed.

229
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
By the way, the banks are starting to suck everywhere.

230
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I used Barclays Bank for Internet Banking.

231
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And all of a sudden, they decided, at least I didn't get the memo,

232
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that the maximum daily amount you can transfer or pay someone is 2,000 pounds.

233
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And they've lowered that to 1,000 pounds.

234
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dude, I can't even pay my rent.

235
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That way.

236
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have to pay my rent over 3 day period.

237
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And yesterday, of course, was the big bill day.

238
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I love doing that on an Easter Sunday.

239
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It makes me feel really good.

240
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And some of the bills you just have to cut a check,

241
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
stuff in an envelope, which is one of my least favorite things to do.

242
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I just like doing it on the net.

243
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But they've lowered that limit for some reason.

244
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've got to find out.

245
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Find a bank though.

246
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let me pay my bills, please.

247
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I did have a fantastic weekend, though.

248
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Even the bill paying wasn't too bad.

249
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Saturday, I got a bright and early,

250
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
wink commander, William, brought over the Delta Shiera,

251
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
my Cessna 182, RG.

252
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's the November 277 Delta Shiera.

253
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He brought it over to Fair Oaks.

254
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And I met him there with Captain Dan,

255
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Captain Dan, who lives in Waybridge, I believe,

256
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
not far from Gilbert.

257
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And he was brought to me online.

258
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I put a call out to shoot.

259
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Who wasn't who put me in touch with him actually?

260
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let me see.

261
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I put a call out that I was looking for a safety pilot

262
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to make the channel crossings with me.

263
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Just because I'm relatively low hours,

264
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
a little over 200 hours in experience on fixed wing.

265
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And he wants someone who can basically save your ass when necessary.

266
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me see.

267
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Who the hell was it was a listener who hooked me up.

268
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I do remember that.

269
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hold on a sec.

270
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm just looking through email here.

271
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Shoot.

272
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, man.

273
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How can I get fine this?

274
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, anyway, Captain Dan really nice guy.

275
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He's from New Zealand actually.

276
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There you go.

277
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm still trying to find out who turned me on to him

278
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
because that was a total email thing, crap.

279
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll find it.

280
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll know by next time I talk about Captain Dan.

281
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So New Zealander works for Kellogg.

282
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Now he doesn't fly for living anymore,

283
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
although he does still teach his instructor.

284
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Kellogg is a subsidiary of Haliburton.

285
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I mean, as a dude, give me back my money first of all.

286
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So anyway, so we had a nice chat,

287
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
had some, the big breakfast as they called at that,

288
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
you know, it's like Biggles man, this airfield.

289
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's great.

290
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's got a little cafe, like coffee shop,

291
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and everyone's in there eating bangers and mash and stuff like that.

292
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And this plane's taken off and I got to take some video.

293
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's what I got to do.

294
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll take some video of pharaohs.

295
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I shot some video of the Delta Sheriff itself

296
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
just a quick walk around, which I may post later today,

297
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
just so you can see her.

298
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Looking so cool with that new interior.

299
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So the point was William came over, brought the plane,

300
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
then Dan and I are going to fly, William back,

301
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and then fly back from Antwerp back to pharaohs.

302
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Although I did put in a little detour since I was in Antwerp,

303
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
it's only a hop skip and a jump to Rotterdam,

304
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and from there only a 25 or 30 minute cab ride to my mom's house.

305
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So we filed a quick flight plan to go to Rotterdam,

306
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
which is a sizable airport, by the way.

307
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's got a real runway, it's got an instrument landing system.

308
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's lit beautifully.

309
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They land 737s there.

310
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The vacation flights usually,

311
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
trans obvious, takes off and lands there.

312
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So, you know, it's a serious airport.

313
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You got to know what you're doing.

314
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And which, of course, I only have to do what I was doing.

315
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Dan had never been there before.

316
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We had all the charts and maps and everything in the frequencies.

317
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So we took off.

318
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Now, I've never done this trip by myself,

319
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
including all the radio communications into Rotterdam,

320
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and I royally fucked it up.

321
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was looking for point Oscar.

322
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It wasn't on our map.

323
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Literally, I could not find it on our map,

324
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
which, of course, is our own planning mistake.

325
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And so I wound up, you know, hanging a sharp left,

326
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
thinking I'm not going to continue any further.

327
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Because, yeah, low and behold,

328
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
if I had continued for another three minutes,

329
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
maybe, I probably would have had a trans obvious,

330
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
737 in my left flank.

331
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But they were very, very helpful.

332
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Said, oh, now look over.

333
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Look over to you, right?

334
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you see the runway?

335
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes, I see it.

336
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What are your intentions?

337
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Said, well, if you'll have me, I'll like the land.

338
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So that was all, all good humor and everything was cool.

339
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And I went to see my mom, who she really is in good spirits.

340
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She's afraid.

341
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But she's fighting this thing,

342
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
very, very courageously.

343
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And so I'm just planning on,

344
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
if I can, pop and over every weekend,

345
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
or as often as possible,

346
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
maybe during a weekday, if I can find another safety pilot

347
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
who can also fly on weekdays.

348
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So she's, she's hanging in there for sure.

349
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
She's definitely, she had some color on her cheeks

350
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and looked a lot better.

351
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then I got back to Rotterdam.

352
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So it was just a short visit,

353
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
but I think any visit is good enough.

354
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Just to see each other is cool.

355
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then as we're taking off,

356
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
he'll like this.

357
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
As we're taking off all of a sudden,

358
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm not, I actually were still in the run-up.

359
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So the plane hasn't actually lifted off the ground.

360
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And I can feel something's wrong.

361
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm looking at my gauges.

362
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I have no power.

363
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Or not, not the power sufficient,

364
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
or that you would really want,

365
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
although I was very close to rotation.

366
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So I aborted, which is something I never done before,

367
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but you know, immediately aborted the take off.

368
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And it was something,

369
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
there must have been some kind of contaminant in the fuel.

370
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Because we ran her up again on the, on the taxiway

371
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and cleared out whatever the problem was.

372
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And then we took off carefully,

373
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
left the gear down for a while,

374
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
as we, as we stayed within proximity to the airport.

375
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And everything was fine.

376
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So gear up and then off to,

377
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
off to Ferroaks.

378
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And as I arrived there,

379
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
they said,

380
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
guess what?

381
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We've got to spot on the hanger for you.

382
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So I couldn't be happier about that.

383
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm going to try and,

384
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
try and get a flight wedged in on Wednesday or Thursday.

385
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This week, just some local flying.

386
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Really to get just to get used to,

387
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
or build up the hours.

388
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And then Saturday,

389
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
most likely,

390
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
now Ron and Marta and Chris are all coming in for our London week,

391
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
which we'll talk about later in the show

392
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
for the Britcasters,

393
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
or the UK podcasters, I should say.

394
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
They'll be coming in Saturday morning, I think.

395
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So they'll probably be pretty fried.

396
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And I'm just going to let them all recuperate on that Saturday.

397
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And then I'll go and see my mom.

398
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So,

399
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
anyway,

400
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
as I said,

401
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll probably post a video of the Delta Shira later today,

402
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
just because it was, you know,

403
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I found my camera.

404
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Remember I was supposed to take it with me on vacation.

405
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Sitting here in a whole different bag,

406
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
taking away.

407
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And we're looking forward to a pretty exciting week.

408
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We've got,

409
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
we're going to start opening up the data for our first listeners.

410
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We're going to do a developer cast for that,

411
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
or a dev cast, I should say.

412
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So,

413
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
that's also coming up on today's daily source code.

414
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I could actually do three shows out of just all the stuff

415
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that I've received today.

416
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I kid you not.

417
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's see.

418
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Have a,

419
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I got a couple of promos.

420
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And this one actually fits into the flying,

421
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
something that I've been thinking about,

422
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
is how we can incorporate this type of content,

423
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
not the flying content,

424
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but an important subject when it comes to aviation.

425
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How we can incorporate that into podcasting.

426
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think that this podcast might have it cracked

427
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
or this system, I should say.

428
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
For weather information,

429
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
24 hours a day,

430
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
podweather.com,

431
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
internet partnership radio.

432
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Number one,

433
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and streaming severe weather coverage.

434
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Internet partnership radio.

435
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
When it comes to severe weather,

436
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
we give it to you first.

437
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You're listening to a breaking news update.

438
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The potential for a few long tracks from tornadoes

439
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
in the super self underscores.

440
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is potentially a very dangerous situation.

441
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And for live nationwide,

442
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
we're just looking right now at the satellite,

443
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
further,

444
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
blender,

445
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and you definitely got to thunderstorm here.

446
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And you've got some good lighting, right?

447
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
One in the past is night,

448
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
probably 4.81 is in the same.

449
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I think that's going to go to weather right up.

450
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's going to indicate that it's a visual kick

451
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
raising a tornado.

452
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's very dangerous.

453
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
With a reputable storm chase,

454
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
or in the field with live,

455
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
report.

456
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Look at the latest analysis.

457
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So in that case,

458
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
hey Michael,

459
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
we've got a second tornado on the ground

460
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to my north of my local internet partnership radio.

461
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The only station to bring you live

462
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
is if you're weather coverage,

463
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
nationwide.

464
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And after the event,

465
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
you can go to podweather.com

466
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and download the chase video along with the entire audio

467
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that's going to be brought to you all

468
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
by internet partnership radio.

469
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There you go.

470
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So all of your weather information,

471
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
whoops,

472
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
podweather.com.

473
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Podweather.com,

474
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
everybody.

475
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There you go.

476
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Adam says,

477
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Alex Wunschel

478
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
had a big laugh listening to the

479
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
mashup on the best of Charlie's

480
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
reminded me of my Adam Alex

481
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
mashup I did last September

482
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
in the 26 show on

483
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
pimpmybrain.de.

484
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Hope you don't mind using yours in the show.

485
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Here's a story,

486
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
a list of my show complained about my

487
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
endless umms and sent me a mashup

488
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
of my umms with more than a

489
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
minute worth length in length.

490
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So at the time,

491
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I decided to check the pod

492
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
father's umms versus mine

493
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and lo and behold,

494
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I won.

495
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I got 81 umms in my episode number

496
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
24 and on your episode

497
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
of 31st of August,

498
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you had only 55 umms.

499
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Anyway,

500
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I decided to let you hear

501
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
a little mashup of your umms

502
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
from daily source code

503
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
232.

504
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And it is August 31st,

505
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
2005.

506
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's,

507
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
we had a,

508
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
um,

509
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
um,

510
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
um,

511
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
um,

512
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
um,

513
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
um,

514
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
um,

515
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
um,

516
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
um,

517
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
um,

518
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
um,

519
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
um,

520
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
um,

521
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
um,

522
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
um,

523
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
um,

524
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
um,

525
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
um,

526
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
um,

527
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
um,

528
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
um,

529
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
um,

530
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
um,

531
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
um,

532
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
um,

533
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
um,

534
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
um,

535
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
um,

536
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and,

537
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
truly the sign of a professional radio

538
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
pronounced a cater.

539
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She just shuts up.

540
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,880
up, which I've tried to do as well. I think the silence is much nicer than the umms, but

541
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,740
man, you get used to that. It's hard to break it. See, I'm trying already. Steve Runners

542
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,140
on a big mission today from the forbid, forbid, forbid, forbid, forbid, it's podcast. I

543
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,540
can never remember the exact title, but you can find it at SteveRunner.com. Today he

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,380
is running in the Boston Marathon, and the guy's wired. He's going to be podcasting

545
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:09,740
the entire marathon, which seems to me you should get an award just for that, just for

546
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:17,500
talking while running, the marathon note less. At the same time, he has some kind of special hookup.

547
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,660
Every, he has a whole bunch of reporting points. You can read about it on SteveRunner.com.

548
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,700
Reporting points where when he passes that, I think he presses a button or something and then

549
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,100
an email goes out if you're subscribed to his list. He presubscribe me so I'm happy about that and

550
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,260
you can sign up for that as SteveRunner.com as well. And he's running in a pod show T-shirt,

551
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,460
which is fantastic. He sent me a picture. It's really, really cool. It's one of our ugliest T-shirts

552
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,660
by the way. It's not an official pod show T-shirt that's as one we'd actually want to give away to anyone.

553
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,700
I'm not quite sure how these things got into, got into circulation, but I really appreciate it's

554
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,220
Steve and he wouldn't take any sponsorship from pod show, which I offered. So what we'll do is we will

555
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,300
donate our sponsorship money to the following cause.

556
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:18,300
Hey Adam, it's Lian from the Las Vegas Bitties. We have fantastic news to share with you.

557
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:25,420
You know that the Las Vegas Bitties are doing the MS Walk here in New York City on April 23rd

558
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:33,020
at the Sunday. Well I wanted to give you an update. We have smashed the goal of $10,000 and have

559
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:43,340
already raised $12,900 as of this morning Friday April 14th. Thanks mostly to pod cast listeners

560
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:50,540
around the world. Our goal is now 15,000 and it's looking scarily like we can make it.

561
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:59,020
So if anybody out there is listening, you can go to www.bittiesforever.com, that's with the number

562
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:07,180
for, or you can go to bitticast.com, BIDDYCAST and click on the link to the National MS Society

563
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:14,540
to raise money to combat multiple sclerosis. This is amazing news for us. We're feeling really thrilled

564
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,260
about the whole thing. And if anybody else is going to be in New York on April 20th, a few days

565
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,580
before, we're going to be having a mad party at Joe's pub to celebrate the release of our

566
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,980
DVD and to celebrate the umpteen million dollars that we had just raised for MS research.

567
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,980
I hope you're well. I hope you had an awesome vacation and that nobody called you and evil

568
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:41,980
overlord while you were gone. Rock on. My girls do nutrition Christina continuously call me the evil

569
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,580
overlord. So the 23rd not just the bitties but also CC Chapman's going to be walking in that

570
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,100
and we will, as I said, we'll donate our sponsorship that we're going to give to Steve

571
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,740
Runner to the MS Walker, fantastic. And I do believe you guys can shatter the 15,000 mark.

572
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,060
Maybe even more. We did pretty damn well when we helped out Lee Wilkins with his dogs. We raised

573
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,940
I think 1,500 bucks very quickly. This is what I mean. That was like a year and a half ago.

574
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:19,820
Jeez. Time flies when you're having fun. Later in this podcast I'll tell you how you can

575
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,620
sign up to get into the data of podshow plus and the podcast delivery network. We're starting

576
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,540
off looking for listeners who are interested in development. We're going to set it up with a golden

577
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:39,980
ticket. Yeah, it's the most democratic way. So we're going to have a special podcast for

578
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:50,060
developers and the developer means you can you understand HTML and what is it? What's the

579
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:56,540
word I'm looking for? PHP. Thank you. That's really all you need to know. So almost anyone who's

580
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,860
really interested and motivated can participate in that and speaking of the golden ticket,

581
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:11,420
remember we handed out a golden ticket which was supposed to be an AV remote for your iPod.

582
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:20,460
But our winner, KJ did not have an iPod. So we sent them an iPod as a winner. Just proving that

583
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:32,300
people really do win on the daily source code. Thank you. I'm curious. I'm curious. Okay, you know,

584
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:44,780
you can't play with the iPod Nano. Yeah, steady. Thank you. Thank you. You sent me an iPod Nano,

585
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:51,660
a two gigabyte iPod Nano and you've got an inscription on the back that says two can from Adam Curry.

586
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:59,900
Keep podcasting, dude. I will. I will keep podcasting hopefully forever to the death.

587
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:09,580
Well, okay, it's not get too serious here. But yeah, dude, thank you, man. I was just standing there

588
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:16,300
in my BVDs and the doorbell rings. Actually, there was a knock on the door and it was FedEx.

589
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,340
They showed up and first thing in the morning, just before I got to work. So I get to load your show

590
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,660
on when I haven't heard today. Load that up and I'll listen to it on my way to work. Cool. Cool.

591
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,140
So dang, man. Thank you. Can't say it enough. Really.

592
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm probably saying it too much. Dude, can. Thank you very much for listening, man. That's

593
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,940
what's all about. Really appreciate that. Nice touch, huh? The engraving on the back to Ken from Adam.

594
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,180
I think that has something to do with the, with the pod show HQ folks who are thinking on their

595
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,820
feet to have it inscribed. That's very cool. It almost, it probably should have said from

596
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,500
daily source code or stay tuned or something like that or stay subscribed. But the whole idea of

597
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:07,100
engraving the the iPod Nano as a prize is good. That's Sam Aaron Rosie. Someone up there is

598
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:15,180
thinking about stuff. Do you believe anything is possible? We do. Where are flink? We believe in an

more of the show, just go to dailysourcecode.com and hear what you're missing out on as of now.

615
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,780
That's right. It's just us again. You know, I think it was Friday. I played the song from

616
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:58,540
360 and what was the name of the song, resume. I really liked it because it was 13 performers in

617
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:05,260
the group and it was, it was R&B and I think the Podsive Music Network was at a certain point,

618
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:11,420
certainly very, very alternative rock heavy and that's definitely shifted and I liked that

619
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,020
balance. I mean, I found even fantastic classical songs, all kinds of good stuff there.

620
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,780
And I liked the the whole idea of kind of giving my resume. I'd like to be your girl. You know,

621
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,420
it's an interesting lyric. It was kind of cool. And I just played it because I was looking around

622
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,780
for stuff and it just popped up somewhere. I can't remember, well, you know, it's like that

623
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,540
social media network stuff on the Podsive Music Network. You never know how you find it,

624
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,780
but once you pop around from song to show, from show to song, from song to show, then all

625
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:42,700
sudden you find some stuff you like. And I got this message over the Easter weekend and it

626
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,900
really touched me because I had no idea what 360 was all about, but have a listen for yourself.

627
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,660
Adam, this is Wes. I'm the director of the music recording program at the Richmond Police

628
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:00,700
Activities League in Richmond, California. The the program that the 360 group came out of and I just

629
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:07,980
wanted to send you a shoutout and thank you for playing our song Resume on your DSC number 360

630
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:16,540
plus seven and show. And I got a couple of kids with me from the program. We just had a little event

631
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:23,500
today. Saturday went out to a little place, little theme park to have some fun. Anyway, what's not

632
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,900
real obvious about the group is that this was an after school program that was started in 2003

633
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,660
by myself with the goal of teaching kids how to use computers to make music. And I wanted

634
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,060
I wanted them to make the best music that they could. So for for those years, we basically spend a

635
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:45,100
lot of time going over our music and feeling very proud and building a sense of community and

636
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,580
kind of forming a little family. So I'm really, really proud and really happy of all the work that

637
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,100
they've done. And to the community of podcasters out there, I also want to thank everyone out there

638
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,940
who played our music because every time you play one of our songs, it motivates the kids in the

639
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,100
group to continue doing this stuff. So thank you guys for doing all of that. And the two members

640
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,420
that I have with me are loaded and looness and I got looness on my left. The wheel. The wheels.

641
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:19,820
And I got loaded. So you guys want to give a shout? Yeah, you know, just want to give a shout

642
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,540
out to the whole bag. You know, we come when we're on the rise right here. Give a shout out to

643
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:30,220
my city rich man, you know, from central to south side, you know, some of our bea dogs and everything,

644
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,300
you know, we keep keeping the flame. And so yeah, we just want to say thank you, you know, to you

645
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,180
and the listeners for listening. So our music that we have, you know, we're doing big things,

646
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,860
great things, you know, loaded, loaded made the beats in the music for the song that's

647
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,780
up there called love. So if you have a jump on that song, it's a really good song. I highly

648
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:57,020
enjoyed me. And then, then looness. Yeah, man, check it out. You should blow the looness, man.

649
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,140
Just want to thank you for being able to be able to play our music. You feel me,

650
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,980
not a lot of people get the opportunities that we have. And you know, just for you to be able

651
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,860
to be able to play our stuff. And for us to be able to hear it, you feel me. It's just a great

652
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,300
irony for me. And I respect you for what you do. As well as I see that you respect us for what

653
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:23,500
we do. I want to thank all who played our music, any kind of our music, any pieces of our music,

654
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,980
you know, me. Thank you all because you got people that put the flame to the fire. You feel me.

655
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,380
Gotcha. And then, uh, real psyching me. And if you can't be about it,

656
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,540
yeah, I mean, don't do it. You feel me because this music thing has a lifestyle. You just can't

657
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,260
get it over. And I just feel me. It's not about the ice.

658
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,660
Man, I'm telling you, man, it's all about the music, man. How you feeling inside? Because, you know,

659
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,860
everything we sing, everything we rap is real. We see it on the streets every day.

660
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,380
All we live it every day in our lives. Give me so I want to give a shout out to y'all.

661
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,900
Shout out to the Bay Area coming up on the 40s catch right now, man. Real good.

Real good. Real good.

663
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,620
It's been for real, man. It's been for real, man. It's been for real where it's all started.

664
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,740
You feel me. Much a lot of money. The worse you feel me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's what's up.

you want on the blog. So thanks a lot, Adam. Hello. Holla. Holla back at you.

668
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,580
Now, you know what those are true American heroes? That's that that is the America that I love.

669
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,140
You know, just trying to make something happen, trying to get some positive going and, you know,

670
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,620
what it really worked. I had no idea what this project was about. Um, when I played the song,

671
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,420
it was just a great jam. I loved it. Uh, so I'll be sure to to play more and other podcasters.

672
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,100
And listeners too, go to the music dot podshot.com. Look up 360 and you'll be able to hear a whole

673
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:57,100
bunch of songs that they've been working on in that California. Okay. So UK podcasters pay attention.

674
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,820
Please, the point is, we're going to have some draft and dots, which is what we've been talking

675
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:11,660
about for the past week. Um, we have Ron coming over his lovely wife Marta and our, uh,

676
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,220
copied it to the copy of business development Chris Jacob. And we're going to be in London,

677
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,260
uh, we'll say they're they're arriving Saturday. And I believe Chris is staying all week and Ron and

678
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:28,380
Marta are going back on Thursday, probably, probably Thursday or late morning or early afternoon,

679
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,180
because we have a couple of meetings lined up, some stuff that made a term and, or will determine

680
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:42,540
how, uh, if and how we want to do anything in the UK market, um, expensive over here. We start

681
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,700
looking at what it costs to actually run a business and you got a time, you got to do that

682
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:53,500
times too to come up with the dollar amount. Uh, so what we wanted to do is we wanted to have a,

683
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:59,100
a get together just to hang to meet with some of the, the forces in UK pod casting. And we've been

684
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,780
discussing this for the past, uh, maybe even the past couple of weeks. And so now we have a date set.

685
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,940
It's going to be Sunday, um, because they, uh, they come inside a day. They're going to be totally

686
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,380
wrecked. I want to go visit my mom anyway. So Sunday, why don't we all meet in London or the London

687
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,700
area? So the only thing we need now, and I'm just going to pick a time. I'm going to say 3 p.m. Okay,

688
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,140
let's just say 3 p.m. I'm not a good, everyone who wants has to come from from, excuse me,

689
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,620
since say, oh, from further away, give some chance to get in. You know, it's not to, you know,

690
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,140
not to messed up traffic wise. Well, of course, there'll be Sunday, so it shouldn't be too bad.

691
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:38,220
Anyway, he don't have to pay that congestion charge. Uh, all we need now is a venue.

692
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:45,740
Now Ray Lane, who's one of our board of directors sent in his suggestion, Ray is listening a

693
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,900
lot these days. He's in real time now, almost. He's given me feedback almost every day,

694
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:56,380
which is putting me on my guard. He, uh, he suggested Wigan Penn, which is in Surrey. Now, of course,

695
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,700
Surrey's pretty big, but I could figure out whether it was. If anyone knows if Wigan Penn is a

696
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,300
possibility, or do we want to go more into the London area? What I suggest is we've got our dates,

697
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:14,140
Sunday, 3 p.m. Maybe the UK podcasters can get together and hash it out on Britcaster.com,

698
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:19,340
or whatever wiki I saw that was up and running, and just give us the right venue. We're not looking

699
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,220
for something fancy, schmancy. I don't think we want to rent out a whole place. I don't know how many

700
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:30,700
people are coming if we have a head count yet. I'm just looking for a corner of the old Vic,

701
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,780
personally, for draft and darts. But let me know. We can certainly put together a little budget if we

702
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,900
have to, if it looks like so many people are coming, we have to have some extra space. I'd like

703
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,740
you guys to help us out. So don't email me directly, set it up, you know, get the conversation going,

704
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,980
and what I'll do is, here's what we'll do. After, after all this set and done, maybe Neil Dixon

705
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,180
can send me an email and let me know, you know, what the final two or three choices are,

706
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,820
or what the options are, or just what the decision is, because we have no idea what's going on

707
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,860
in this market, where you can get beer and play darts and have a good chat. The music can't be too loud,

708
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,260
you know, we want to have ambiance. You understand what I'm talking about. It's funny because I,

709
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:21,020
I looked at Neil's website, his blog this morning. Neildixon.com, and he has a post here,

710
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:28,300
which really blew me away. The post title is Britcaster.podshow.com. There, that'll start the

711
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,420
tongues wagging. He says, in the past few days, since the word going out about Adam Curry wanting to meet

712
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,860
UK podcasters and my well-timed Skype interview with him to be available soon, I've now had five

713
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:44,780
conversations. Yes, five of varying degrees of seriousness and intensity, asking when Britcaster.com

714
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:52,060
will sell out in some way to a London UK division of Podshow Inc. Truly astonishing. He got to read that post.

715
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:59,500
Dude, we haven't even set foot on the shores here and already we're the evil empire.

716
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:09,820
My god. Well, Neil, I hope you post that interview soon, because we talked about exactly

717
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,460
this type of stuff in that Skype interview. You don't have to edit it either. Just put the

718
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,260
whole freaking thing out, dude. No reason to pare it down. Let everyone hear every single piece of

719
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,140
that. I think that'll be really good, including the part where you stopped because you were afraid

720
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:29,820
that audio hijack pro would crash if you didn't start a new audio file. Please do that, will you?

721
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:37,020
So everyone can just hear what's going on and not start, oh man, I thought we were more sophisticated

722
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,620
over here. The slam idol podcast, which is recently celebrated is one year anniversary, is now in

723
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,220
the midst of the voting process on contest 10. The contestants are Mike McGee. The sound of

724
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,420
a heartbeat and laughter in all the time it takes to learn to fall from the sky. Down the hall

725
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:58,540
and right into love. Why is it, right? That we have a president who has blatantly

726
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:03,340
defrauded the people of his country at the ballot box twice, Haran Alkalaga.

727
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,220
I have learned that stupidity is not an affliction, but an addiction of mine until

728
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,000
real eyes. I have a problem in remedy, yet with comments.

729
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,060
Health and lifestyle have been rearranged. My feelings for you have never changed. You've made

730
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:31,660
a choice to distrust and dislike. And David Goodchild. Brainspokes, brainspokes, brainspokes,

731
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,060
brainspokes, brainspokes, a bread. My stain in angels telling an A and crying. You could list

732
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,820
all the poems and cast your votes. At the slam idol website, slam idol.trypot.com.

733
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:48,260
If you have not listened to the slam idle podcast, go there and check it out.

734
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,900
It took me a while to figure even out what was going on there, but if you like spoken

735
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:59,380
word, if you like intense poetry and I'm talking modern, really modern stuff, you'll

736
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
like this.

737
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,820
In fact, I want this stuff on the Pod Show podcast network.

738
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:09,500
I really like this idea and just thought the content is so amazing it blows me away.

739
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:16,980
So check that out, the slam idle podcast and it's time to vote for your favorites.

740
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,940
Hey Adam, P.D. Love from Love House Radio and the Daddycast.

741
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,500
Have to tell you, this past Friday I made it out to Nashville for the Pod Safe Showcase

742
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,940
with Matthew Eble, Kevin Reeves and Jeff Smith and that was a big thrill.

743
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,820
It was amazing to, well, first of all, to see them perform live, but also just to meet

744
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:40,980
the guys and I mean, just the nicest set of guys ever and it just, in talking to Matthew

745
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,420
before the show, it just seems that this is something that could be done all across the

746
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,220
country and maybe that, you know, Pod Show could get involved in sponsor some of these events

747
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,500
and kind of have like the the Pod Show music series or the unlabelable.

748
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,400
Whenever I hear the unlabel, I'll keep waiting for some guy to hop out of the woods

749
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,100
going, it's crisp and clean.

750
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:04,220
Anyway, just, you know, we were talking about it and it would be great to do these

751
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
things all over the place.

752
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,980
I mean, you have pockets of Pod Safe artists that are all in the P.M.N. all over

753
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,980
the country.

754
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,700
You see, he's got the group up in Boston and just to have something where they can get

755
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,700
together and do a showcase of all the Pod Safe people and the thing is that this,

756
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:23,460
the, all artists just represent it, podcasting and the P.M.N.N. and everything right along

757
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,100
with their music, it just goes into the whole community between podcasters and the musicians

758
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
and everybody.

759
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,420
So, again, it was a great event, you should have been there and I'm sure you can hear it

760
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,300
once they get all the good audio off the board.

761
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:42,060
I've got the, the crappy audio from the crowd on my site, but, you know, it's, it was a great

762
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,620
event and just kind of sparks some ideas and I'll throw in my hat and the ring if I can

763
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,460
do anything to help and kick off some of these Pod Safe Show cases all over the place.

764
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,660
So, just wanted to pass that along to you and again, if you can find any way to do it

765
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,540
and need some help by all means let me know.

766
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,100
I'm at lovehouseradio.com or thedaddycast.com.

767
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Thanks a lot Adam.

768
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,100
Peter Loaf.

769
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Thank you very much, man.

770
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Yeah, we've been talking about this.

771
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:10,100
I've been talking to Matthew about it and this has been going around the offices quite

772
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
a bit.

773
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,540
Now, what's not going to happen, most likely won't happen.

774
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:20,100
Pod Show does doesn't have the money to sponsor a series of Pod Safe Music shows.

775
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,660
There's no real revenue model yet that take it sales, but, you know, I don't think that's

776
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,020
really or, you know, or we could be selling your CDs and take a cut and don't want to

777
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
do that.

778
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,020
It's just going to cost too much money.

779
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:37,660
Just giving an idea and we had a chance and brother love perform at the portable media

780
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
expo.

781
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,180
They stood on a, on a riser had like a flashlight on them and there was a little bit

782
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
of PA.

783
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,420
I think that costing a five grand right there, you know, it's travel costs and it's all

784
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
that stuff.

785
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,940
So, it doesn't just way too expensive.

786
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:59,020
However, we have been working very, very hard on a big sponsor who actually has venues

787
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,740
where we could set this up in multiple locations.

788
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,740
So it would be a professional venue.

789
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,340
It would be probably these venues anywhere from 500 to 1500 people.

790
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,580
There would be people already in the neighborhood who would wander in.

791
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,700
It's, you know, there's food and drinks and all kinds of great stuff like that.

792
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,620
And it would be sponsored by, by a big entity.

793
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,180
And we've been working on that, which means that, you know, musicians can get paid even.

794
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,900
Maybe some travel expenses taking care of all that groovy stuff.

795
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,420
But certainly for, you know, pay, play for pay and for promotion.

796
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,380
We're still working on the, on the contracts, still working on this deal, but we'll let

797
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,380
you know about it as soon as possible, of course.

798
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,100
And I'm pretty, I'm pretty confident it's going to, it's going to happen, just had to

799
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,380
call about it last week.

800
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,420
Now, of course, when you have a sponsor that, you know, there's a lot of stuff that you've

801
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,140
got a massage and mold into one, so you don't wind up with like a really lame name for

802
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,420
the events or something like that, you know, when people put up the money, they always

803
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,140
want to have something back in return.

804
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,740
So we're working on that stay tuned, more info about that coming here on the Charlie.

805
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:13,460
Wouldn't it be cool if you could get instrumental music, just to listen to, or for background

806
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:19,580
music on your podcast or just do whatever you wanted with, I could say you wanted some

807
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,580
rock ability.

808
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:37,260
We'll be some sort of techno stuff, some blues, some R&B, some stuff with some groovy

809
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:51,420
organ and stuff with a good beat, something a little bit, spacey and melancholy.

810
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,940
Well, you know, it would be cool, and you can get it.

811
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:03,180
If you go to podcast.painmachine.com, I'm Derek Miller, and I've made all this music, and

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:46,100
Derek K Miller, man, we are so in sync with the vision for mashing up our art, I really

821
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,100
feel that you're on the right track, the Jeff Smith is doing the same thing, you know,

822
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,660
yeah, go ahead, you can take this stuff, you can do whatever you want with it, give me

823

825
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,540
We're going to work that out.

826
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:05,380
And within what we're building, the social media network that is known as podshow plus,

827
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:10,220
that is going to be a part of it, and we already have some of those pieces working.

828
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,660
And remember, I've talked about, you know, social reward and economic reward, where,

829
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,100
you know, just getting the credit is the social reward, and people saying that was cool,

830
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:23,980
and then if there's any finances that come into it a sale or transaction of some sort,

831
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,140
of course, everyone who was contributed to this would want a financial reward, we,

832
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,260
George's Russian scientist, I think we're talking to him this week is getting very close

833
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,260
to being able to identify pieces as they've been matched up so that we can, you know,

834
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:43,180
deconstruct that and make a lot of that credit, both social and financial, completely

835
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
automatic.

836
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,140
Does that make any sense?

837
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,620
It barely makes ends to me, but I know that we're getting somewhere close with something

838
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,620
very, very cool.

839
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:56,060
So, I think we just continue to keep matching as we go along, and man, are we matching?

840
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,820
We're matching up arms and arms, we're matching up music, and that's why I just make sure

841
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,140
that you give out the credit for now, and we'll be good.

842
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,140
Hello.

843
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
Uh-oh.

844
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,940
Forgive me, podfather, for I have sinned.

845
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,900
I've missed a couple of episodes of Charlie right after your vacation since I too was traveling.

846
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,900
So you may have addressed this previously, and if you have, I apologize for bringing it up

847
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,900
again.

848
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,460
But hey, this is Chip from Top of the Potsay, so over at crushland.com.

849
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,620
I was curious to know if you're going to try out the new max off where it runs windows,

850
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,260
and that way you could run cast blaster on your Mac.

851
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,860
It's even make your life easier, so you don't have to carry around two laptops.

852
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,740
If you are going to try this out of this curious, if Bootcamp was going to be more to

853
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:44,740
you're liking or parallels was, and querying minds want to know, let me know.

854
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,660
You know, I haven't loaded that yet.

855
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,020
I've learned that you don't want to mess around with too much stuff down at the OS level

856
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,020
with data.

857
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,500
I've messed up some pretty good installs doing that.

858
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,900
I did, however, see that there was some other project.

859
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,420
I think K2 sent a note to me about that.

860
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
Let me see.

861
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:16,300
There's some other similar application, hold on a second, Kevin, and let me see Bootcamp.

862
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,340
There's something similar that's out there that I believe is, no, that's not working,

863
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:28,620
that I believe is open source, and it actually allows you to load both the here it is.

864
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:33,900
Shoot, no, that's not what I'm looking for.

865
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,060
It allows you to, I'll find out and I'll put it in the show notes.

866
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:43,140
What it does is it allows you to load your Mac OS and then run actual windows applications

867
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,860
in a window inside Mac OS.

868
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,460
So you're basically loading up both OS at the same time.

869
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,740
And that, now that to me seems like something very interesting.

870
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,140
I'm not quite sure how far along they are in the project and the process.

871
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:03,300
If all the drivers are supported, et cetera, it may be much simpler than it was in emulation

872
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,460
mode because all that stuff basically already works with windows with a dual boot.

873
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,980
So it should be possible.

874
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,780
I'll find, I'm sorry for the bad preparation on my part there.

875
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:18,100
I'll find the link to whatever that application was and I'll put that in the show notes.

876
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,980
I'm going to try that one because, yeah, duh, it would be so super cool.

877
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,220
You know, I run two computers when doing the show.

878
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:30,580
I have my, to Shiba where I run cast blaster, that's the main music unit.

879
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,140
And then I have my Mac where I'm running, I'm the outliner pro.

880
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,500
And that's where I have the rundown of everything that I'm going to do in the show.

881
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,580
Actually, the files are embedded within that outline document.

882
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,140
So when you export it to a folder, it actually exports all the files.

883
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,980
And then you can import them right into cast blaster.

884
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,260
So having that on one machine, yeah, no doubt will be totally cool.

885
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,660
But I have no idea what the support is.

886
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:02,260
And if anyone has loaded windows with boot camp on their Mac, let me know if cast blaster works.

887
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,820
Okay, you can find it at castblaster.com.

888
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,940
Hey Adam, grab a cup.

889
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,180
This is jam and Dave Jackson, this smiling host of the musicians cooler.

890
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,380
And why am I smiling?

891
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,380
That's right, the musician's cooler is now the newest member of the pod show family.

892
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,580
It's simple.

893
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,180
The musician's cooler is where musicians come to trade advice.

894
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,380
For years, I've produced the musician's cooler newsletter.

895
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:37,140
A newsletter by musicians for musicians found at musicianscooler.com.

896
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,300
And with the development of technology, it rapidly evolved into a podcast.

897
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,780
We've interviewed hundreds of successful musicians and entertainment lawyers,

898
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:52,260
booking agents, photographers, promoters, and authors as we spotlight new techniques and new

899
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,700
technologies to help musicians get more fans, more gigs, and more music sales.

900
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,900
We've shared mentoring moments with heavy hitters in the music industry,

901
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,540
as well as leaders and pioneers who provide state-of-the-art tools for musicians.

902
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,620
So again, that addresses musicianscooler.com.

903
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,220
I'll see you over there as I take the musician's cooler to the next level,

904
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,180
as the newest member of the pod show family.

905
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:21,060
And in the immortal words of Randy Boffman of BTO, he won't see nothing yet.

906
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,740
Stay cool.

907
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,260
It's not the toilet flush.

908
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,420
Dude, welcome to the network.

909
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,540
Great to have you here. And yeah, I really did what's going on at the musicianscooler.com.

910
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,660
You should check it out for sure.

911
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,620
portions of this pod cast brought to you by Ackyview.

912
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,460
Check out Heather and John L's pod cast at download.ackyview.com.

913
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,940
ACU-VU-E. Speaking of my list in the Omnioutliner Pro,

914
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,100
I'm only three quarters of the way through it.

915
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,500
I think we're going to go just a little bit long today.

916
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,580
Hey, Adam, this is Travis Goss, one of the hosts of the on radio show.

917
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,780
Thank you for playing my promo in Charlie No. 366.

918
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,100
That was really cool if you had to do such a thing.

919
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,460
And I got a question.

920
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm really interested in joining pod show.

921
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,940
And I'm sure my co-host would do the same too.

922
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,580
But I was wondering, how does one go about getting a contract?

923
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,780
Because I think this show that I have is very, very, very...

924
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,900
Well, it's okay, I suppose.

925
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,340
But I like to really, really blow the lid off of this thing.

926
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,260
But I'm just wondering.

927
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,460
How in the world is one get a contract for pod show?

928
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,460
Can you pull a few strings just like that?

929
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,100
I mean, I'm a big, big fan of pod casting.

930
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,180
I think this is a wonderful medium.

931
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,940
And whatever strings you could pull to get a contract

932
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,380
sent over here would be wonderful.

933
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,260
Thanks, Adam.

934
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,300
Keep up the good work.

935
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:37,940
You know what?

936
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,900
The Charlie rules.

937
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,780
Oh, thanks, dude.

938
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,940
Let me just pull a string here.

939
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,780
Let me pull that one.

940
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,220
Okay.

941
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,020
If you want a pod show contract, contact Keith and the girl.

942
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,900
Dude.

943
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,100
Now, there's multiple levels.

944
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,300
I believe there's four.

945
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,420
And what I'll do around, see if we can do it the Thursday,

946
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,380
will announce the actual levels that you can utilize

947
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,420
or the different ways.

948
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,740
Level is not the right description.

949
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,780
There will be different ways you can become a part of pod show,

950
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,340
work with pod show, or just use pod show stuff.

951
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,180
And one of the ways is you can just,

952
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,140
if you want the pod cast delivery network and you want the services,

953
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,780
the basic technology services that come with that,

954
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,060
you can just buy it.

955
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,860
You don't have to do any other business with us other than pay us

956
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:32,500
on a monthly basis, and you'll get all the functionality, everything.

957
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,340
And I actually believe that there will be people who will just want to buy it.

958
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,740
Then that's going to be a very simple arrangement for an add insertion.

959
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,460
You'll have one tag at the beginning of your pod cast

960
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,420
and a tag at the end, and you use everything for free.

961
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,700
And then there's two other pieces that, well, one,

962
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,100
you have to be invited into, essentially.

963
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,860
And there's a number of factors and reasons why you could be invited

964
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,460
into the network to participate in bigger promotional deals.

965
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,500
One is you just ask.

966
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,140
So you're kind of on the right track already.

967
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:03,780
I had them.

968
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,100
Yes.

969
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,740
This is Marta, the podcast diva.

970
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,740
Pick me up on my podcast.

971
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,620
It's all about Marta and me.

972
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,100
You can also find me at it's all about Marta and me.com.

973
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,740
Give me the girl, baby.

974
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,740
Yeah, she sent me a picture.

975
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,060
I got to post that in the show notes.

976
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,980
It's a cutout.

977
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,580
Strategically cutout poster.

978
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,860
Yeah, that's how to get in my good side of it.

979
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,180
From the pod save music network, Henta, mirrored love.

980
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:46,180
I kind of find you, the longer you may see,

981
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,220
you'll never find time to wait tight.

982
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:54,260
There's only one now, and that's to find with you.

983
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:58,260
There's only one place that you can hide.

984
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,260
Holy, your dreams become a little brighter.

985
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,140
Holy, how do you open the ring box?

986
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,660
Oh, we're gonna find it.

987
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,060
But gonna find the hell right now.

988
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,580
I think it's in my mirror.

Hand to let me know if you're performing anywhere in the in the in the greater gilford metropolis

1019
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,220
I'd love to come and check your stuff out for sure

1020
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:39,100
Information coming up on the golden ticket to get into the pod show plus and podcast delivery network just minutes away

1021
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:45,820
After this from David Epolyto. Hey Adam, it's David Epolyto that guitar man from central park in New York City

1022
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:52,540
I just wanted to reach out to say thank you for driving that that lead covered wagon into this new frontier

1023
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,860
You know, I'm an independent musician. I have been for years. I'm a very very lucky man. I love my life

1024
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:05,260
But all of us for years have been trying to find different ways to get music out there to people, you know, and

1025
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,500
And it was actually the guy who runs my website's idea to join the pod safe music network

1026
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,580
We joined in the first week of March

1027
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,060
Two days later where we were getting played on podcasts all over the world now. I think we've been played on

1028
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,780
36 shows maybe more probably more. I've made friends with some of the podcasters

1029
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:28,060
I've talked to other musicians and turned them on to it and they've they've all joined the pod safe network

1030
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,020
It's just a very very exciting thing

1031
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:38,940
Actually, I'm wondering we're debating now the pros and cons of I think my next CD might not be a CD

1032
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,980
We might just make it downloadable. I can't wait to start really selling music on the network. So

1033
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,940
I just wanted to say thanks again. Keep it up. It's all a very very cool thing

1034
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,580
No, dude, you are cool

1035
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:57,420
You've been bust in your ass for years in central parks on days mainly I believe and yeah

1036
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:03,260
This is how the stuff works now if you had 36 podcas players song let's say that the average

1037
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,940
podcast, you know, you played it on the source code. So that's gonna up your average quite a bit

1038
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,620
Let's say it's a thousand let's say it's a thousand listeners

1039
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:19,980
36 thousand people who have heard your music of course. That's gonna translate into people coming to see you donating buying your

1040
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,460
Your CDs and yes, of course

1041
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,780
I know that they're going to buy tracks

1042
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:31,100
MP3's free and clear no DRM off of the pod safe music network. I'm I'm so confident because we're seeing it work

1043
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:37,900
With artists who are already testing with and it's really really working. I mean hundreds for tracks. It's just freaking awesome

1044
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,540
And I believe that we're

1045
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,620
Anyone who comes into pod show plus I think you'll also

1046
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,940
Around the third of May you'll also have the full

1047
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:54,140
Access to buying songs. I think I'm not quite sure. I have to look at the at the schedule

1048
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,180
But as you can tell we're starting to release stuff so we're starting to

1049
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,540
Get people into the networks starting to let people

1050
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,020
Experience it for yourself so

1051
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,820
Stay tuned to the source code stay subscribe because we'll be bringing you more opportunities to try

1052
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,220
Out as we start to unleash an unveil everything over the next 14 to

1053
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:19,740
Next 14 to 30 days before we're a completely open in public beta and anyone can jump into the mess that we're making

1054
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,820
Including the French band with bastard who sent me an email

1055
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,100
Adam nobody's perfect it's one of those lazy French bastards who's writing to you

1056
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,380
That's what my English is so bad. I know I know all that bad bar

1057
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:39,100
And as a lazy fellow I can't figure out myself how much ban with I'll need to start my podcast

1058
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:43,020
I went to go daddy.com and I feel that 500 gigabytes per month would be more than enough

1059
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,540
What's your point of view on that is go daddy a good hosting platform for a young podcast

1060
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:52,620
The answer is go daddy is great for domain names. It's great for web logs. It's great for

1061
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,540
Your email and and yes if you have

1062
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:03,740
If you don't aspire to huge amounts of downloads of course, it's fantastic you can even get discounts

1063
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:10,620
By using one of the DSC codes DSC one two or three when you check out and

1064
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:16,380
I think today I should put again in the show notes. I should put a link as to what you exactly get but it's great discounts

1065
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,700
So yes absolutely

1066
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,540
Now if you expect to grow then you may want to check out the pod

1067
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,340
Pod show podcast delivery network

1068
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,940
But that may not be until a month or so

1069
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,700
Depending on how fast we get everyone start rolling in

1070
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:40,620
So definitely once you take on a monthly basis and then see if you like it and see if the works out and see if 500 gigs a month is is enough

1071
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:47,660
It wouldn't be enough from me. I'll tell you that. I'm moving to her about it's unbelievable. What's what we're shipping out the door on our pdn

1072
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,940
Let's see what do we have here

1073
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,820
Sorry so far

1074
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,340
I need a photo for the cover of a tree pod

1075
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,860
And I need a by next Monday

1076
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,420
I'm not funny exactly what I want

1077
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,820
It's an identity theft privacy type of shot

1078
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,620
I'll send you the details

1079
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,660
All right, come in. I'll do it

1080
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:21,260
Find out how a simple photo shoot goes completely wrong and teaches this photographer a few lessons

1081
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,420
Or two or three

1082
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:28,220
Listen to the whole story on the next photo cast available at edd hidden dot com

1083
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,900
It's podcast

1084
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:38,380
Hey Adam this is Dave from the David matcho. I was trolling through our server logs the other day and after a few who has looked up

1085
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:44,380
So I realized we had a new listener one Adam Curry from Gilford, England. So if that was you checking out the show man

1086
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,860
We totally appreciate it if anybody listened into the Charlie wants to hear our show

1087
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:57,820
You can check out www.dave and matcho.com. Thanks a lot take care Adam. Yeah, my IP address is so well known now

1088
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,180
And although I think I thought I had changed the

1089
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,740
The Nick info on that so it just says uh was it say

1090
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,180
Curry co or something or silicon pole or something like that

1091
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,460
Apparently that hasn't changed everywhere

1092
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,900
Wouldn't it be cool if you could actually identify your listeners that way?

1093
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:25,180
That is a part of what pod show plus is when someone is listening to you and I mean listening

1094
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,140
You know you can call it subscribed if you want and that's a part of it

1095
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:33,180
But if they're in your audience you're gonna see it and not only you're gonna see it just by a name

1096
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:39,020
But you're gonna see someone's picture and you're gonna be able to find out more about them and see what they're subscribed to and what pod

1097
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:43,580
See if music they're listening to and this is how the social media network is gonna come together

1098
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,620
So I like the fact that you're thinking that way. I hate the fact that all my

1099
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,340
Information is still openly available on the net that way

1100
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:55,100
But the the concept of knowing who your audience is and being able to put faces to them

1101
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,980
Oh man, I'm really you know because it's all closed

1102
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,420
I only have what I only have like 23 listeners

1103
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,980
Within pod show plus who are listening to the daily source code because I'm basically crossposting everything

1104
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:14,700
They I in fact I'm actually using that system all the time and then I cut and paste stuff out into my wordpress blog or to the daily source code.com

1105
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,340
feed

1106
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:22,780
But it you'll love it. You really will it's extremely cool now

1107
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,060
to get into the

1108
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,060
podcast library network and to

1109
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:36,060
Start messing out messing around with pod show plus and everything that we've been building for the past

1110
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,540
10 months

1111
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:44,460
What we're looking for first up is for developers who are interested and who would like to contribute

1112
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:51,020
And there will actually be some some opportunities there for both social and economic reward for you

1113
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:56,780
And here's how it's gonna work now already I've gotten a ton of email from developers who want in and when I said developer

1114
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:03,340
I'm really talking about web development skills that include HTML and PHP and maybe a little bit of CSS

1115
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:09,740
But even that's not necessary. So that's just that's millions and millions of people. I know that so many people understand those two

1116
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:16,700
technologies very well and you'll be able to contribute making modules for pod show plus which you can whip up in

1117
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:20,700
in five minutes or five hours and it's just depending on what complexity you want to put in there

1118
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,660
But it's really really simple you get an SDK

1119
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:28,700
There's going there's a developer site developer dot pod show dot com and to get it rolling

1120
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,620
Today I'm going to do

1121
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,140
I don't know if I'm going to do two separate Skype calls or or one I'll start off with Andrew Grummit

1122
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:43,020
Who was really leading our developer program and who has extensive knowledge of everything we're doing in the underpinnings and then

1123
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,820
Excuse me

1124
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,860
It's because I've gone over an hour already. You know now this and say it was talking back to me

1125
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,100
Also want to talk to Kevin Astrosky

1126
01:02:55,100 --> 01:03:00,300
known as K1 who has really been the the the managing developer on on all of this stuff and

1127
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:05,340
They'll start and it will just make a separate podcast to make it a separate podcast feed

1128
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:10,300
You'll be able to find that easily and we're just going to you know just talk about what's going on

1129
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:17,660
What what kind of opportunities are to create cool stuff and then obviously we're going to put in I think

1130
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:24,620
50 golden tickets in that podcast so there may only be a hundred people who subscribe to it

1131
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,940
That means that half of them will get an invite and we're going to make it really really simple

1132
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,900
We'll probably even well

1133
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,660
When you hear the the golden ticket then you'll know exactly how to get into

1134
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,980
Into the system how to get an account and how to get rolling so

1135
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,900
That will be posted up on curry dot com later today

1136
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,900
I was you know when Kevin and Andrew get in that'll probably be

1137
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:54,300
Was it to 5 p.m. My time so I probably won't post it until this evening UK time

1138
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:58,860
But you'll certainly be able to subscribe to it by tomorrow and and it doesn't matter

1139
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:03,580
When you subscribe to it because let's say only 25 25 people subscribe

1140
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,580
Actually not have to think about how we're going to make it work you're going to do multiple episodes

1141
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:14,140
That's right multiple episodes. I think I will do it separately with Andrew and separately with Kevin. There you go

1142
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:20,700
So even if you subscribe now and you don't get the golden ticket by the next episode you might be eligible for the golden ticket

1143
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:25,740
And we'll just keep it keep it going until obviously we can start letting everybody in and won't take all that long

1144
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:30,380
But if you want to get an early want to get in start helping us out and doing some cool stuff and maybe making some coin

1145
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:35,260
Keep an eye on curry dot com for the link to the developer the dev cast

1146
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:41,260
For pod show plus and the pod cast delivery network now to wind it up. I've got a promo and

1147
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:47,420
One more piece of feedback from comic strip blogger who has been all over the situation with

1148
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,100
Member states of the European Union

1149
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,580
Allowing or not allowing other

1150
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,380
Member state workers to come in and

1151
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,460
freely cross the border and and work in a different country and

1152
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,900
He is I believe of Polish descent and

1153
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:08,860
The polls are in high demand across Europe because in Poland

1154
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:14,380
I think your monthly salary may be no more than about 500 bucks a month

1155
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,940
Whereas they can make

1156
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,340
1500 a month in other

1157
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,860
Member states of the European

1158
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:26,460
Union now of course these are different countries but the concept of the European Union is

1159
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:33,900
Just like the United States where you can go from Connecticut to New York and you don't have to show your passport and you can

1160
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,700
Work just as happily New York as you could in California or in Texas or in Maine or wherever

1161
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:44,860
And the Netherlands is I believe all countries are supposed to allow this as of January 1st

1162
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,740
2007 most countries already do the Netherlands

1163
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:54,540
Doesn't at the moment they've limited it to 35,000 I believe I'm not an expert on this and

1164
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:03,260
There's a lot of polls who would really like to come to the Netherlands and to work and and it's interesting because I saw a whole documentary on this just the other day

1165
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:09,100
These are highly educated people these are doctors these are teachers these are librarians you know these are

1166
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,780
People school in law people school in

1167
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,980
police work and you know they're literally working in

1168
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:25,500
In jobs that you know and only for limited time so they'll come over to a country like the UK or Germany I believe

1169
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,220
and they'll work in

1170
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:33,900
In a greenhouse you know potting plants and they'll do that for three months they'll load up on cash

1171
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:38,940
And then they'll go back to Poland and they'll take the rest of the year off which is of course

1172
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,100
Not the way Poland should be run but it's working you know and everyone seems to be happy

1173
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:49,100
And the Netherlands was supposed to make their decision I believe

1174
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:58,060
In the past week and since there's so much political turmoil in that country they they pushed it off and they said well, you know what

1175
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:01,340
That can be looked at at the end of the year

1176
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:07,180
That probably has something to do with elections and you know where the it's just shifting of power that's going on

1177
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,380
No one wants to

1178
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:13,740
Win or lose is important debate and topic depending on what side of the fence you're on

1179
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:20,380
So that is actually I really do enjoy reading that that thread that conversation thread on

1180
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:25,660
Curry dot com which is where it seems to take place between a couple of Dutch posters and comic strip blogger

1181
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:30,300
And today he sent in well, you know, it might be a little set about properly since we're way over

1182
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,740
comic strip no penalty for having fun

1183
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,460
comic strip

1184
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,420
comic strip

1185
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,540
whole different blogger today

1186
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:53,900
Let me convey a final message to numerous Dutch fuckers to your podcast fucking final

1187
01:07:54,300 --> 01:08:02,460
I am not black, but now I know how African Americans were feeling when they were first to slave labor at

1188
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:06,140
Plantations in USA and get no freedom of movement

1189
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:12,780
I know because Netherlands the nice me and other new use it is freedom of movement too

1190
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:21,020
I am not muslim, but now I know how muslims who are living in Netherlands are feeling when they have to live

1191
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:29,020
in a country that treats them as strangers and when native folks the Dutch give them absolutely no respect

1192
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:33,980
I know because Dutch don't give me an respect to

1193
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,300
yes

1194
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,540
by end of April 2006

1195
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:46,780
Netherlands had to give their decision about opening for new use citizens and their answer and decision is

1196
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:50,140
no sack of you lesser people

1197
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:54,380
two years have passed since big bank EU enlargement

1198
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:02,380
not to confuse with pencil enlargement and Dutch still are racist pigs and not liberal

1199
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:09,340
they are extirting or fucking lovers of humanity as they try to portray themselves

1200
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,380
fuck you Dutch

1201
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:19,100
Now blogger I understand how you feel although I don't think your comparisons are really on par there

1202
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:26,460
because slavery, working in slave is a little different than not being allowed to work somewhere else

1203
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,780
so I gotta call you out on that

1204
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:39,500
you know this is not the Dutch are not racist I don't believe you can say any people is racist

1205
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:46,300
but there's a lot of protectionism going on I was in a took a cab from Rotterdam Airport to

1206
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:52,300
Bullscope where my mom lives about 25 30 minute journey and I got one of these really typical

1207
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:56,940
Rotterdam cab drivers I got his card as well by the way I said core next time I'm coming in

1208
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,780
I'm calling you because you're my man you're doing ground logistics from Rotterdam

1209
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:08,140
fucking awesome this is in your typical you know 250 pound guy bald head earring

1210
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:15,020
you know looking like Mr. Clean kind of has a fine ord that's the the Rotterdam football team

1211
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:18,220
for those you don't know has a fine ord flag in the back window

1212
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:25,580
total Rotterdam guy and they've had huge immigration issues and integration issues in the so-called

1213
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:33,020
multicultural society in Rotterdam and I'll just give an example of how I think protectionism can be

1214
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:42,460
often misconstrued by words of course with racism so he does about 150 euros a day on a good day

1215
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:48,860
driving his cab and they recently about a year and a half or two years ago they deregulated

1216
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:55,580
cab the the the the taxi business so anyone can basically become a cabby it's much easier

1217
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:59,660
to get into it you don't have to pay huge license fees etc you have to take a test but

1218
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:05,180
now what that did of course is it fucked up the whole taxi industry and now there's way too many

1219
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:11,340
cabs and what you see is that there's a shitload of immigrants is what I'll call them people

1220
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:16,380
from other countries who have immigrated to the Netherlands who have the proper paperwork

1221
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:22,220
have the proper vehicle but they're you know they have basically no work because there's just too many

1222
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:27,100
cabs and if you go to light supply and Amsterdam now anyone who's who's going to go there in the

1223
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:32,620
neck and in the future you'll see it about 10 o'clock at night there will be 150 cabs lined up just

1224
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:39,260
waiting for rides and they'll be waiting for hours because you know there's too many cabs and you know

1225
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:45,660
the one cab goes and three more cue up in the back so of course what you see there is a lot of

1226
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:55,420
illegal activity and what the these these new cab drivers often resort to is illegal activity such

1227
01:11:55,420 --> 01:12:00,780
as you know dealing drugs or other types of you know they do drive around but they're probably

1228
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:06,220
you know delivering stuff that is illegal and into into stuff that's no good but they're using

1229
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:14,220
the the same system to um longer their money so you know you just make sure you drive some miles

1230
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:20,220
and then you say okay today I made 400 euros which is about the 500 bucks and I'm going to you know

1231
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:26,220
they actually say to the you say to the tax man here's what I made on the made 400 bucks every day

1232
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:32,060
this week every day this month every day this year and so I'll pay my taxes but that's illegal money

1233
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:38,140
okay so they've just wandered that perfectly which of course is works great in a cash business like the

1234
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:45,980
taxi cab business here's hello geos almost done I was just in the middle of the

01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:34,540
mix with a little bit of lemon mayo am I lucky guy or what

1252
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:47,100
who said I heard another version of remember we were watching Denny Crane yes he said the woman

1253
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:55,420
I just met is and he said he's angel in the bed in the bed room and a horror in the kitchen and then

1254
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:02,300
David Spader says isn't that the other way around and he says not last time all right baby love you thank

1255
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:15,100
okay back to the rant so you've got the the real cab driver who's doing 150 euros a day and you've

1256
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:21,180
got the illegal guy who's doing illegal stuff the guy who's doing illegal stuff doing 400 a day

1257
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:28,380
laundering his money so what happens is the tax man then says to core the legal guy hey

1258
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:35,820
how come you're only doing 150 we're all these other guys are doing 400 we think you're trying to

1259
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:43,900
duct taxes you understand the problem so the Dutch I think are very poor at voting their

1260
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:51,100
conscience very very bad at it you know you get the government you deserve as it's a democracy they

1261
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:55,580
can vote for people to come in to come out I the whole party system I'm not a big fan of

1262
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:59,580
in the coalitions and all that but you know whatever that's their system it's been working

1263
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:05,180
for almost a thousand years so that's that that'll be good three quarter of a thousand years

1264
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:11,260
whatever it is incredibly long time hundreds and hundreds of years but what it what's the easiest

1265
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,020
thing to say it's to get those fucking people out of here they're the problem we're of course the

1266
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:20,540
policy really is the problem and not the people lead me not into temptation all that groovy stuff

1267
