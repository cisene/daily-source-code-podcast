I wake up around 3.

24

I head pounded, I take a look around me.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm surrounded, my stuff will make it to the city.

26

And it sounded like I will never breathe.

27

And I'm drowning.

My soul's hurt in the same mind as the need.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's what's up, you must not put it in this.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
In the world, only God can fill me up.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I won't put his love on the temptation, just strong.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I need to pray if you want to change the path you're on.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Just say, you need to wake up.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I forgot what's important now.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wake up.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Cause money ain't everyday.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wake up.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
All I do is break all day now.

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Wake up.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm losing my sanity.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wake up.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Got the one that could save me.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I gotta give my life together now.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I look around, all I see are snakes.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And there's that still hate cheat.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I know it, everybody knows it.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I see that face and there's no good.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Cause it's like still hate cheat.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I know it, everybody knows it.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I just got lonely.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Make me a servant.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I ask for mercy.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't deserve it.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Cause I'm a slave too.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll be hurt if it catches my eye.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I need to change.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm always chasing.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't have money.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
People will kill for.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't have money.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There's never enough of.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't have money.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There's nothing but misery.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't have money.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's nothing but emptiness.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
In the world, only God can fill me up.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Put his love.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But the temptation just strong.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I need to pray.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If you want to change the path, you're wrong.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I need to wake up.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I forgot what's important now.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Wake up.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Cause money ain't everyday.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All I do is bring my name out.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Wake up.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I got to do it for my family.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wake up.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I forgot what's important now.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm losing my family.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Wake up.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Got the one that can save me.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Wake up.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I gotta give my life together now.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I just got a new whip.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I need another one I just got a new crit.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I need a bigger one.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I just got a new job.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I need a better one I just got Tangis.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Already spent.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Do you want what I got to do to eat?

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's all the game.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's important.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Down the street.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's all the same.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Same song.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And it's the same beat.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
On the race.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
On the race.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
On the race.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
On the TV.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's nothing but emptiness.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In the world.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Only God can fill me up.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Put his love.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But the temptation just strong.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I need to pray.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you want to change the path, you're wrong.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I love you.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000

Wake up.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Cause money ain't everyday.

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Wake up.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Cause money ain't everyday.

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wake up.

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I gotta do it for my family.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wake up.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I forgot what's important now.

Wake up.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm blue.

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll say it.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Wake up.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Cause the only one that's the same beat.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wake up.

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't make it like that.

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Wake up.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wake up.

Baby.

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Since you weren't here before the show.

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let me just adjust yourself.

155
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let me see.

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How's your headphones?

Yeah.

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah.

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're the one with the problem.

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No.

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I got no problems.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey everybody.

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Baby source code for Friday.

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How's your jet lag?

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
My jet lag is fine actually.

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You actually.

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You always have a jet lag.

169
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I live in consistent consistent jet lag.

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

172
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So how are you doing?

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think you balance that out with the spliff.

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Uh-huh.

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, absolutely.

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know.

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I know.

179
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's called a self medication.

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was fine yesterday.

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Actually.

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey, I feel good.

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You felt good.

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But you really went hardcore.

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because we got back from San Francisco on.

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What day was it?

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Day before yesterday.

00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It was.

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It wasn't a two day.

190
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No Wednesday.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We left on Tuesday on.

192
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

193
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We were Wednesday.

194
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I was conking out.

195
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I was laying in the chair with a laptop burning my nuts off and fell asleep for an hour.

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You slept deeply in the in the plane.

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Only for an hour in the plane.

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I didn't sleep a lot in the plane.

200
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, yeah.

202
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I mean, this plane could be going down.

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Could be descending at 5,000 feet per minute.

204
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It wouldn't even notice.

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Uh-huh.

206
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No problem.

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh.

208
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah.

209
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So then it came home.

210
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And so I never slept.

211
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And why didn't she?

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why didn't she just go to sleep?

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I just wanted to stay awake.

214
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't want to miss anything.

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, okay.

216
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Can I?

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Right.

218
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And miss out to anything.

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So then I came home.

220
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
My parents were here.

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Started to talk right of it.

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We have no idea how you feel.

223
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They can't remember it.

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Isn't that what parents are for though?

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know.

226
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When you're 80, you don't remember any more.

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
How that fell.

228
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Only only 15 more years, huh?

229
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What?

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Then you'll be 80.

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, don't.

232
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How does that feel, huh?

233
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You imagine that?

235
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You imagine that?

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, you know what?

237
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I wish.

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And I hope.

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Wishing.

240
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And hoping.

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And hoping.

242
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And wishing.

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That I'll be 80 and healthy.

244
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Absolutely.

245
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
As well as as healthy as they are.

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Exactly.

247
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And then your daughter was already complaining about us.

248
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

249
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We'll be bitching even more.

250
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, I'll be out before you know it.

251
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's what she said yesterday.

252
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, that's right.

253
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
She says, I'm leaving the house when I'm 17.

254
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Uh-huh.

255
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Uh-huh.

256
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why?

257
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can't ever clean up your room.

258
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You can.

259
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Exactly.

260
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.

261
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I'm a little more practical.

262
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So what are you going to do for like friends?

264
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Have you ever seen kitchen?

265
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're just making a cracker?

266
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

267
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like World War II.

268
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Battlefield.

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
After she made one cracker.

270
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah.

271
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

272
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So anyway, I'm pretty much on schedule.

273
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because I slept those hours and then I stayed up until like two.

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, everything went well until we went out yesterday.

275
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, you already want to get to that now.

276
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hold on a second.

277
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We can't go that fast.

278
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We want people.

279
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You got to build it up a little bit.

280
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah.

281
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But now I feel really shitty.

282
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's so funny because I said the Patricia said, look, we have to do the show now because

283
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
we're going to miss the sound like window p-dubs waiting.

284
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Everybody's waiting for the show so it can be put into the show.

285
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And I said.

286
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So you're sadly said, no problem.

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Just let me put on some makeup.

288
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Uh-huh.

289
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Uh-huh.

290
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's audio.

291
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's a sound.

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't scare you in the face.

293
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Looking like shit.

294
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, you're on fire.

295
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You never look like shit.

296
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't know about not having the, the temporary teeth in.

297
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But don't pinch and ignite.

298
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I know.

299
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, on Trucker Tom is something to say to us.

300
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yo, Adam and Patricia.

301
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Trucker Tom here.

302
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I think I've come up with a new name for the Carlos.

303
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You should call it Lady Patricia.

304
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And the guy.

305
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I love the interactivity that goes on between you and Patricia.

306
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There's something about listening to two people that really are buddies.

307
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Forget the fact that you've been married 20 years.

308
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You really are buddies and you just seem to go together so well.

309
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And there's something that's really charming about that.

310
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Something that's fun to listen to.

311
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So Lady Patricia and the guy.

312
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I think it's appropriate.

313
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You see what's happening.

314
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You can find my podcast at Trucker Tom.

315
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And then Trucker Dude.

316
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Hot chill.

317
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Trucker Dude.com.

318
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Trucker Dude.com.

319
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah.

320
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I thought that was in your shit.

321
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

322
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You don't seem to understand what's happening here.

323
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is you are completely taking over my limelight.

324
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's gone.

325
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's fading.

326
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm pot fading away.

327
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
As much information as you always have.

328
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But it's so imagine.

329
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a double edged sword.

330
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know, it's like I have all the shit that I really want to do.

331
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You know, people send feedback.

332
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Which stuff we don't have time for when we're on the show together.

333
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And, you know, promos and all that stuff.

334
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And then whenever I do those shows, you know, people love the fact that I'm playing promos and feedback.

335
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know, Adam, you're kind of boring without Patricia.

336
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You know, it's like, I can't, um, um,

337
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
F-do-fi-do, F-do-fi don't.

338
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh my god.

339
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,040
What's okay?

340
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, thank you.

341
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It was so sweet.

342
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,040
Oh, man.

343
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,000
I, I so want you to meet Trucker Tom.

344
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You guys be so funny together.

345
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He sounds very nice and sexy.

346
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He's very sexy.

347
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, he is.

348
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah.

349
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, wow.

350
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you like guys with Skolls tattooed on to the back of their head.

351
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Sometimes.

352
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No, no, no.

353
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Woo.

354
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Woo.

355
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And officially, I know I showed this to you last night.

356
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,520
last night but I'm just gonna hold it up again. You are now officially a nerd. Yeah. This is, uh,

357
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,960
I'll put a link to it. It showed up on Valleywag, but Tom Morris made this, uh, this great, uh,

358
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,080
photo montage. What are the nerds doing? And it's like, uh, Mike Arlington and, uh, Cory Doctro,

359
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,320
Steve Rubel, Steve Jobs, Jason Calcana, Steve Kilmore. I mean, good company. Yeah. Uh,

360
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:59,560
a whole bunch of old guys and me. Yeah. Yeah. And the Cory's are in sunny California. This

361
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,720
beautiful picture of us at, that was at the gig, I guess at the, uh, at the three bands in the city,

362
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,840
the rock show. Yeah. Yeah. So, but it says, what are the nerds doing? You are officially a nerd. Oh,

363
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,520
good. Well, I think it's a big compliment to be called a nerd. Yeah, yeah, because I always, you know,

364
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:22,200
I was talking to Marta, Marta Ron. Ron's wife. Ron's wife. And, um, she said, um,

365
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,960
we were talking about our husbands. Oh, boy. Oh, I wish I had a little microphone on you then. Yeah.

366
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,600
And she thinks that Ron is a really sexy man. And I know that the women always fancy, uh,

367
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,080
Ron Bloom. Yeah. That's true. He has something. He has that, uh, comes into the,

368
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:46,760
male, macho, shining, she's around. He has that. And we were talking about our husbands.

369
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,360
And I said, well, you know, Adam, remember, what was that? What did we bubble bubble bubble bubble?

370
00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:00,120
And you bubble bubble bubble bubble, this is a rondo. That and slow down. Let's hear what does Adam

371
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,840
do? And what does wrong do? And what is wrong do? We're talking about when they get angry,

372
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,280
when they're tired, how you have to be understanding because they're so busy. It's so hard to

373
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:16,920
live with us, isn't it? We're living their lives. Oh, man, give me a break. Yeah. You know. Well, that's,

374
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:25,240
that's your, your, um, excuse me. Um, this investment. You also, if you, if you're your,

375
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:32,840
your man, your husband is, uh, doing something really good and, and, um, uh, it's successful.

376
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,880
And I don't know what I think you, excuse me. It's, it's, it's all to, to back him up and be there for

377
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,600
him is your investment. And by the way, that works the other way around as well. That's what I mean.

378
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,760
Twenty men who, uh, invested in their wives. That way around, yeah, investing, helping them in

379
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,800
what way they want you to help them. And I have to say with this, with this venture that we're doing,

380
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,640
you have been incredibly, uh, investful. Oh, it's something. Yeah. You've, you've, you've,

381
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,760
become natural. No, but, you know, it's the little things. It's like, okay, so we're

382
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,440
on. I'm going to go to San Francisco for two weeks. And then you're like, okay, that's a shame.

383
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,560
That's a pity. But you're not, you don't do like, oh, I miss you and come on. What you do kind of

384
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,000
at the end of each trip. Of course. You know, every time the moment you did, if you didn't know,

385
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,840
it would be like, yeah, I was talking about what we said about our husband. And then

386
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:27,400
Marta mentioned, she said to me, Adam is such a nerd. I don't see him. Uh, so there's nothing

387
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:35,320
sexy about him. Yeah, how about that? And yeah, yeah, I can't see him being a great lover.

388
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:43,560
Or because I said, Adam is wonderful. Oh, but don't him. Wow. Yeah, it's wonderful. And I can't see him

389
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:52,600
as a good lover. He, he's so nerdy. I said, yes. Exactly. Exactly. Now you hit it. Now you hit it because

390
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:00,440
nerdy guys. Yeah. Are the best lovers. The, the man that you don't think anything of or

391
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,120
I can't see even doing, you know, something. Yeah. Those are the guys. They're still, you know,

392
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,520
very sexy. They're good. They're good. They're nerd. Because we've had time to study.

393
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:19,480
It's Latin, sexism. It's, it's hidden, hidden, hidden sexuality. It's sexuality. It's sexuality. Absolutely.

394
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:29,560
Absolutely. It is one big surprise. After not. Emphasis on big. So they go nerdy. Big, big, big. This one was for you.

395
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:36,200
Big surprise. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're glad he's young. He's another message round.

396
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:44,680
That's his father. It's bigger than nerds. That's his father. He's back. I had done this. He's

397
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,520
Mr. The Family, Ed from Tom's End. I just happened to become a shit blogger's news agent.

398
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,480
And the film I mentioned, it comes to it bloggers, because it comes into my news agent.

399
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,680
And I'm actually into it. That makes it women's feeding goats. And you're supposed to have

400
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:09,320
to buzz as well, presumably to practice. So by now. Roger's doing something weird. He's,

401
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,840
so he called into the voicemail line instead of sending his usual thing. And he's like

402
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,920
got like this feud going on with comic strip blogger. Yeah. So I'm not quite sure. And he's got this

403
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,600
new phone. And I don't know. It's a whole thing that's going on. Well, what was he saying? That he,

404
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,800
he knows, uh, we're comic strip blogger, blah, blah, comic strip blogger. There's some chocolate in his

405
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,000
butt. Something like that. But I'm telling you, I just, I thought it was me.

406
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,720
Huh? Listen, airing this. You thought it was you that you were Roger? No, it was me hearing this.

407
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's exactly what he said. I don't know. I'm just trying to go with

408
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,320
the flow with those two guys. I don't know. They're into some kind of feud. Oh, okay. I have no idea

409
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,240
what you're doing. It's interesting for us. Yeah. You know, Roger's small is the ultimate nerd.

410
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,880
So it, you know, that's why I put that in there. When you're talking about. I've never seen a,

411
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:04,280
it must be one of a hell sexy guy there. Roger? He never knows. Well, you know, surprise.

412
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,840
Uh, I think that although you may not have seen him, he's probably seen us. You know, he does like

413
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:17,640
sneak in, sneak around the bushes, the trash and stuff. So. So as a surprise for

414
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,240
your parents, primarily for your dad, actually. Oh, I'm not going to listen. This was it. That was it,

415
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,800
yeah. Oh, are you expected more? Oh, yeah, I'm not. I don't know. No, no, this is it. This is it.

416
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,800
This is it. I'd like it when he sent it. I hate it when he used the voice mail, though. It's

417
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,840
very hard to understand. Yeah, very hard to understand. It's funny, though, because the more I

418
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,680
listen to Brits, I can almost hear Roger's smalls in every single one thing. I'm not kidding. Yeah.

419
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm not kidding. You listen to like them. He could be Roger's smalls easily. Yeah. So,

420
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,760
well, even going to Saintsbury, it's still sometimes very hard to understand them.

421
00:17:52,760 --> 00:18:00,040
Uh, Brits. I have to say hundreds, a hundred times a pardon or excuse me. Yeah.

422
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,760
Say it again. Excuse me. And I say it as long and I want to hear what they're saying. Who was it that I

423
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,960
called the other day? Um, that I actually had to ask like five times. Yeah. Oh, you know, it's

424
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,200
much, it's a much, it's mold. It was an, uh, it's an Indian woman, I think. Oh, maybe it was the

425
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,000
part of something different. Oh, that's very hard times. Oh, man, because yeah, because they're not

426
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,760
they used to hear it here. Yeah, of course you get used to it. We don't know that accent. Well, I do

427
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,720
know. Yeah. That's for sure. That's so sweet Indian people. I like them. All Indian people.

428
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,400
No, most of them that I met here are very nice and very polite. I think most of the most of them are

429
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,040
Pakistani, like the drivers who drive for GM cars. Yeah. They love you, man. Oh, they do.

430
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Oh, they love you. I'm nice to them. I have a feeling, yeah, I have a feeling that, um, that they

431
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,560
are treated in the UK. Yeah. Pakistanis are all treated as, yeah, they do get a bad deal.

432
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,640
And because I see guys getting out opening the door for you, bowing, waving to you. Like, wow,

433
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,520
I'm a princess. You, yeah, you've got them. But I talked to them. I want to know where they're coming

434
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,760
from. Do they have a wife? I want to know. I want to know. You know, how they live and we've always been

435
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,040
like very, very, very interesting. But it's very interesting to hear, you know, actually the

436
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,480
life that they're living and what it's all about and where the parents are and the families are.

437
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,680
We know where their families are. In the big house in Pakistan. No, they're in woking.

438
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,280
Some of the families are in woking. That's it. Some of them woking. It's interesting because

439
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:39,320
all people are interesting. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's life. Yeah. So as a surprise

440
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,600
for Patricia's parents and primarily for your dad, um, I got tickets to the Sinatra Show at

441
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:53,400
London's palladium in London's West End, which was last night. And, uh, and, you know, I don't

442
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,600
even know how to categorize this show because it wasn't a musical because, you know, there's really no

443
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:07,400
no dialogue. It wasn't, uh, it wasn't a concert because, of course, you know, it wasn't there.

444
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,240
Sinatra, but he was there. Yeah. This was just a show, I guess, we'd have to call it. Sinatra

445
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,400
in the palladium. That's what the show called. So the way that this works is there's a, I think

446
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:26,360
I counted 27 piece orchestra. Yeah. Right. And they're on stage in, you know, in a like a bandstand.

447
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,360
Fantastic. Old guys, right? You know, older older musicians. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What is old?

448
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,760
Well, I mean, um, I think they're round about 40 to 60. Right. Oh, that's what that's

449
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:46,280
come to be. So the best jazz big wind. You mean jazz jazz jazz. Yeah. They, they know how to do it.

450
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,080
So then they had a, um, kind of like a ballet. I'd have to say, uh, another slime.

451
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,840
No, of course, lime means they would be singing. And they did sing some, but there was more dancing

452
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,520
and props on stage and setting the move. Now you have to know that my, my dad is a great musician.

453
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,080
He is, of course, he had big bands, especially in the time that Frank Sinatra was big. He also has

454
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,720
the God-given talent and it is God-given talent, uh, for arrangements. Yeah, arrangements without any

455
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,800
instrument. Yeah. You can just do it in his head. Yeah. You can just do it in his head. Yeah. Music in front of

456
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,640
him and he writes just like Mozart. Yeah. He'll write like arrangements when he hears in his head.

457
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,400
I mean, yeah. It's unbelievable. It is. So I'm very proud of my dad and he's one of the best jazz

458
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,120
saxophone musicians from Holland. And well, he's getting old and he's miss, he misses, you know,

459
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,440
play. He doesn't really play anymore. Well, yeah. He does now then with some, with some.

460
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,480
Now those guys are old. Those are, it's like, you know, sorry. Well, that's one of the, the,

461
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:55,320
um, the little, the little CDs that I made with my dad's big band were all, they were all, um,

462
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,920
uh, 80, 70, 80 and even over 80. I could actually play that if you want to. Yeah. And I did that

463
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,680
especially for my dad because he wanted me to sing with him again. And I thought, you know,

464
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,160
it's always good. So anyway. He's your daddy. Oh, cute. Yeah. You should be pleasing your daddy.

465
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,640
So the end of song was, of course, the daddy. Okay. Oh, yeah. I'll cue that up. We'll play that in a second.

466
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,440
Okay. So let me, let me finish explaining what was on stage. So there's probably 10 women, 10

467
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:33,720
guys who were, you know, dancing, singing some of the choruses, some interaction. I mean, the real

468
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,000
thing is every single song. And really, I don't know, this could only have come from the

469
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,960
Snatcher family because it was really Snatcher talking about his life. Yeah. I'd never heard this

470
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,480
interview before ever. You know what this was from? Yeah. It's from, uh, C, it was a CBS

471
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:57,800
static. C, yes. Yeah. I thought CBS, um, interviewed at the ever gave, but never used it. Nobody ever

472
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:04,680
used it. So they found it again. Yeah. And used it this time. So it was brand new. And why he tells

473
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,640
all stories. Yeah. No, it was fantastic. And then what they did is they had the screens that were

474
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,120
dropped down. All different sizes. One was completely horizontal, uh, you know, thin vertical ones.

475
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,960
Yeah. And, and hold on. Let me get there. Let me get there. Yeah. Let me talk about the video stuff.

476
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,080
Yeah. Oh yeah. Exactly. The video. Yeah. Technical stuff. Um, these were high density screens.

477
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,200
I mean, these were, um, I must have been DLP or whatever. I mean, you know, the screens. It wasn't

478
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,680
being projected. It was actual screens. It was beautiful. And so they did two things, obviously,

479
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,520
because they had all those before a whole bunch of performances, uh, class, some of the

480
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,160
some performances actually recognized what they had done is they had keyed out all the background.

481
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,920
Sometimes they put different backgrounds in. And, and the audio, they did a fantastic job with

482
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:57,720
basically getting rid of the original track and the band on stage would play, um, the, you know,

483
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,640
their own version. We're playing the track. Well, now here's where I wanted to just say something

484
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,200
about that. Oh. As good as, and, and it was technically, this was an incredible show.

485
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,640
And a whole thing ran on autopilot, because I was watching the control booth that could see it,

486
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,320
you know, on the other side of the theater. It was just one person with all the computer.

487
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,680
Drinking coffee had his feet up on the desk. You know, the thing was just rolling around.

488
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,640
I was looking at it. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Um, there was a, um, uh,

489
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,400
there's a monitor, um, on the, on the balcony. Yeah. So that the, uh, the, well, I guess we'll just call

490
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,440
actors on stage so that they could, you know, see the conductor when, because the conductor, you know,

491
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,080
he had the click track and he had all the cues and, and you know, so you can see exactly when

492
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,920
when you have to start to sing. Yeah. So that guy was very, very important for the show. But what I

493
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,400
did notice, it was his show, actually. Well, boy, speaking of geeky nerds. Yeah. He was definitely

494
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,200
a geeky nerd. Yeah. You know, even though it was technically perfect in an all fit,

495
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,120
there's something about, uh, and we've seen Sinatra, one of his last concerts in New Jersey.

496
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:08,440
Yeah. There's something about him interacting with the band, um, you know, the way only he could,

497
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:16,760
you know, you may think. Hoppically go over three, you know, three, um, beats, whatever, bars, beats,

498
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,640
bars, that I missed. I really did not have that, you know, Sinatra. Of course. And no,

499
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,440
well, but that's the first, you know, I can sing every single Sinatra song. I have the last time

500
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,400
I have all his and Lawrence Wilkes albums. I remember we saw him there, and I saw him before that,

501
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,560
in Las Vegas, coming up through the curtain, but then through the band. All right, through the band.

502
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:47,160
I came up. I didn't even have something you was there. Yeah. That's typical. And then you could

503
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,080
see, I was in the second row, you could see his blue eyes. They were so blue. And I thought,

504
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:00,120
no, no, no, you know, they're all blue eyes. Very, very blue. And he looks, it's almost like he looked at

505
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:10,120
every person in the audience. You feel so, um, like you, you get attention from him. It's wonderful.

506
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,120
Well, he was probably looking at you and at the guys. No, hey, darling. Not really. It was amazing.

507
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,440
And that moment I understood why this guy was so big. So that is exactly what I missed last night at the show.

508
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,120
That was just, it's not there. Okay. That's my turn. Okay. And I speak now. You just talked a whole

509
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,000
time about the whole Sinatra show. No, I didn't, I didn't explain what I thought. I wasn't done yet, but

510
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,040
please, go ahead. Okay. Please, please go ahead. Well, I think the most important thing is

511
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:48,520
that he could have even done it without the dancers. For me, the dancers were not even there.

512
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,120
And yes, there's something. Looking at him at the screen.

513
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,160
Yeah. I can't say something. Yeah. Here's the problem with the dancers. And I studied this

514
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,400
for three songs in a row. Yeah. Not one of the women was hot looking and not one of the guys was

515
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:09,400
hot looking. It was not not one single one. Could I say, oh, man, I was waiting. I was waiting. I was

516
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,440
waiting. No, no, no, no. It was very sexy. Which one? She was a little bit fuller and she played

517
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,680
that very sexy woman on the piano. You know, that Roger Rabbit with a short hair.

518
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,440
Jessica Rabbit with a short hair. No long. Long blonde hair. There are wigs. Okay. But that's what

519
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:33,160
they're all wigs. No problem. I didn't think. Not one single hottie that the dancers and the

520
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:39,320
singers were looking like movie stars. I should have looked like movie stars from

521
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:46,600
these days. You know, like an Ava Gardener, like a Brigitte Bardo, a like a Malamon row.

522
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:53,960
They didn't have the glamour that I found on the screen exactly. That I'm in so much. I'm in

523
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,720
holding it. And then underneath there was a little bit of black and white, a little fade out

524
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:06,520
thing going on for me. Remember the shows that I also have on tape for myself from the 60s,

525
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,680
the black and white. Not many. You know, one camera and it was only a little bit dull.

526
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Switching the lens together goes up. Not that feeling. I got that feeling again. Like, you know,

527
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:25,960
a sixies TV show that was still not really, you know. Well, so part of that of course

528
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,400
could have been intentional because it did start in the 40s and it got went all the way through

529
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:37,560
the 60s. And I think you cannot draw too much attention. But it was not the dancers didn't

530
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,640
belong to Sinatra's world. Here it is. I got, and they tried to do that. They really,

531
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,400
because all of the Sinatra footage was black and white. And they didn't. So they were very colorful,

532
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,800
actually. I think the contrast didn't stop. Bryce, lady, you won't let me talk at all. All right.

533
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,400
Okay. Go ahead darling. No, you please. You clearly have a lot on your mind. I'll wait.

534
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:08,360
Well, I think they didn't have, they didn't study the way they performed in these days enough.

535
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,800
They were in English. They were English. That was. They were there, too. They were in 40 and 45.

536
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,240
But the, yeah. But so some of the actresses won played me a ferro, which was actually pretty good.

537
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,840
She had the haircut and everything. And kind of that attitude you want to slap her for.

538
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,280
But there was, you know what I mean. And then there was, there was two or three other

539
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:37,000
pieces where the female, some of the female actors would sing along just a little bit with them.

540
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,400
And with it or speak along in an English accent, that didn't do it for me. I was like, no, no,

541
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,120
that's, that's just, just wasn't right. And why was she doing a duet with him?

542
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,880
Ah, because they had to have at least one duet in the show.

543
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,240
I mean, he's done duets. And actually, you know what? They had that whole piece of videos.

544
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,200
Nancy was there. They had that whole, they had that whole piece of video from Bono.

545
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:07,400
Yeah. Which was that at the American Music Awards. It was some award show. Very good.

546
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,560
It was a damn good speech. I don't know who the, the speech wrote that. He wrote that.

547
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,800
He wrote. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. The tough. That definitely wrote that. That was a good speech. Wasn't it?

548
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,080
My God. Yeah. And we're not big Bono fans. No. But listening to that, I was like, wow. Wow.

549
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,480
Totally. Yeah. Do you think you didn't even talk about that? Absolutely. Of course we didn't. We didn't talk

550
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,480
about the show at all. I wasn't allowed. No, I don't want to talk about the show. No,

551
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,720
yeah. Um, I have your CD. It's not pod safe. You realize that, right? So we could get arrested,

552
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,680
go to jail and be Bubba's bitch. Is that daddy? Yeah, you want me to play that one? Yeah. Okay.

553
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,640
Hold on a second. So you want to set it up? You want to. So my dad is being big band with me. Just,

554
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,840
you know, for my dad. Well, I mean, you do a little more set up than that. I mean, it's an actual CD that you

555
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:57,720
believe. Well, a couple of songs we recorded real fast in a studio in Rotterdam. She dumped Rotterdam.

556
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:04,760
And we gave it away when I had my cosmetics because made a company for Christmas, you know, just.

557
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,320
So the band is, it was actually your dad's big band at the time. Was the big old band? It was a big,

558
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:16,280
small big band. And the guys were all 80 years old, right? Yeah, but great musicians. All right. Let's give it a shot here.

559
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,840
I'm playing this off the other computer. So I have no idea what kind of luck we'll have. Here we go.

560
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,320
Daddy, gee.

561
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:53,320
I'm swelling, say we're skills, we pay with labels. Daddy, only want the best for me.

562
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:07,160
Here's an amazing revelation with a bit of stimulating. I'll be in your great sensation.

563
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,400
I'll be on inspiration, Daddy. I won't have read you, car.

564
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,080
Champagne, caddy, red, daddy.

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Oh, we want the best for me.

566
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,120
Here's my dad.

Here's an amazing revelation with a bit of stimulating. I'll be in your great sensation.

568
00:32:51,720 --> 00:33:02,280
I'll be on inspiration, Daddy. I won't have charge of counts and sex for large amounts,

569
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:10,040
Daddy. Oh, we want the best for me. Daddy, gee.

570
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,480
I'm swelling, say we're skills, we pay with labels. Daddy.

571
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,240
Oh, we want the best for me.

572
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:32,120
Here's an amazing revelation with a bit of stimulating.

573
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,560
I'll be in your great sensation. I'll be on inspiration, Daddy.

574
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,840
I won't have read you, car. Champagne, caddy, red, daddy.

575
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Oh, we want the best for me.

576
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
Here's my dad.

577
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:19,560
Here's an amazing revelation with a bit of stimulating. I'll be in your great sensation.

578
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:30,280
I'll be on inspiration, Daddy. I won't have charge of counts and sex for large amounts,

579
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,520
Daddy. Oh, we want the best for me.

580
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,200
Oh, we want the best for me.

581
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,400
Oh, we want the best for me.

582
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,280
Yeah.

583
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,080
That's sweet.

584
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,760
You're so amazing. Half way through the song, just like, okay, turn it down. I've heard enough.

585
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,320
No way, man. This is awesome.

586
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,240
Now, one thing that really irritated me about that song, no, about the CD.

587
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,240
I about to know about the Sinatra.

588
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,600
Oh, can I just kind of just back and out this for one second then?

589
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:12,120
So Patricia Pye and the John Pye Orchestra with Daddy written by Bobby Troop and in memory

590
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,080
of the fabulous Julie London who sang the song originally.

591
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,560
Yeah. Yeah. Don't give me that look.

592
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,720
Is she dead? Yeah.

593
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,920
Oh, I didn't know that.

594
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,200
Yeah, she's dead. The people who represent her music, by the way, are not dead.

595
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,000
Remember how much they charge us for using that for a TV commercial Holy Cranky?

596
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,880
Let me tell you.

597
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,400
Great stuff, great stuff. I love that to you.

598
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,720
And isn't a good that I them such a lazy bugger that I hadn't sent that to that guy yet, but I still had it.

599
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,200
Yeah, maybe now I'm going to send it. Well, he has it.

600
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,960
He doesn't know. I'm going to send this to you. He wants the CD. He's a collecter.

601
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,120
So one thing that I always hate because in a musical,

602
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,160
Yeah. That's why I didn't do a musical yet.

603
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,320
Now you know that can you talk into the micro musical people? Yeah. They sing.

604
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,080
They all sing like that.

605
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,600
Everything is like that. And you always know. Especially like that.

606
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,840
And you know exactly when they're going to go into a song, right?

607
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,200
Because then they start the movement starts to slow down and then all sudden.

608
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,640
Oh, they start to sing. But oh, you hear me. Yes.

609
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:30,680
In the conversation. But the girls who sing and I think if you have a show about Frank Sinatra,

610
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,960
you know, make sure that if somebody sings in that shows, sings exactly the way you

611
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,560
sang in these years. Yeah. Yeah. 40, 50. And so they, they, I don't know what

612
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,600
sound was. But the moment they start to sing, it was all like, I can occur.

613
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,440
Doesn't go with and the hands, and that I'm speaking Dutch because my parents are here.

614
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:01,800
And then they do a piece of and do sisters kind of thing. Yeah. That didn't work at all.

615
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,360
The little costumes aren't. Now, I am the best. First of all, those costumes were wrinkled,

616
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,280
ill-fitting. And you see that too. And some of the shoes were wrong. I hate to say,

617
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,040
but I've gotten a real eye for things and clothing. And he's really dirty. That's for dirty.

618
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,000
Did you see that too? Okay. The Frank Sinatra had. But in general, in general,

619
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,560
this was a good show. No. No. What I wanted to finish that. And so they did the end

620
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:33,000
sisters thing together. You know, the suits. I didn't fit that well. You see those little things.

621
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,720
Little things. Little things. Little things. I see those things. And I think it seems to me that they

622
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,760
paid a lot of attention to the technical parts of the show. Exactly. And just, and then it's

623
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,160
right. And it's like they had some choreographer who was only responsible for the choreography. But

624
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,800
no one looking at the total picture and saying it doesn't quite all match the nail together.

625
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:58,280
The harmonies from the so-called Andrew Sisters kind of thing that they did wrong. Wrong harmonies.

626
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,880
Yeah. Wrong harmonies. Because the Andrew Sisters' harmonies were wrong. The lead.

627
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,800
Now the lead. No, no, no. In these days, the lead was always in the middle.

628
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Then you had the third force, the higher, the third harmony was up there above the middle.

629
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,840
And then you had the lower voice under there. So the lead was always in the middle.

630
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,640
Right. And the lead sometimes took over from the other. That they shifted, right?

631
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,240
Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. And that made it so fantastic.

632
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,360
And they got it all wrong. And a lot of people have that wrong. No. We made a study of that and we did

633
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,480
the best thing and we had an award for that. I don't have, I don't have any star sisters stuff.

634
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,440
Well, that's time with you next time. Next time I want to go to jail.

635
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,800
In general, though, how would you rate the show?

636
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:53,240
I really enjoyed it. But that's because I'm a for in Sinatra fan.

637
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:01,800
Yeah. And I think that even he's set his charismatic. He's great. He's one of that. We never will.

638
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,360
We never, never, never will have another Sinatra. We won't say that. But not like that. You know?

639
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:16,200
Yeah. The guy lived, lived to sing and his voice and easy sings very easy. And I so I enjoyed that.

640
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,800
And even I said, I told you already that even without the dances would have been a great show.

641
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,360
Yeah. You know, because he's still, even not being alive. He still did it.

642
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,480
So ladies and gentlemen, the Patricia Pi rating for Sinatra. From one to ten?

643
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,720
Yes. Very big eight. Oh, okay.

644
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,280
And that's because of the two points is because of the dancers and singers.

645
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Oh, really? It would have been a ten if they would have been a ten if that was a little bit more perfect.

646
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,600
Yeah. Now, it's a bit poor. If you plan on going to the Sinatra show,

647
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,760
it's at the London Playedium. Yeah. About half a block down. There's a cafe.

648
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,000
But go and see it because it's amazing. It's definitely see the show. But if you're going to see the show,

649
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,640
do not repeat, do not go into cafe logic, which is half a block.

650
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,480
We were like, look at six, 30. We have an hour before the show. This is a cafe.

651
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,040
So why don't we just pop into the cafe and we'll have a quick bite to eat. It took us four.

652
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,800
It took him 40 minutes for fucking sushi. Yeah. I mean, and they were very apologetic.

653
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,840
But they're like, oh, yeah. Well, all of a sudden, all the people came in the same time.

654
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,760
Well, you're in the theater district. Hello. You're next to the Playedium.

655
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,360
You know, you're going to have people in there. You noted they have to be on time. That's sucked.

656
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,680
That really does not stand. So we missed the actual half of the opening number.

657
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,000
Yes. They let us in, which is nice. Yeah. But it's, oh my god. When you talk to them and I said,

658
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,760
can we come in a little bit late because we're still waiting? But that was unforgivable. Let's just

659
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,800
just put it different. I sent you to go talk to them. Because I know if I go to talk to the guys and

660
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,200
say, hey, if we come in later, is that okay? They'll look like, it's screw you. But when you walk and

661
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,920
you look killer last night, you had your new shoes on. You had, you didn't take it. You're handbag.

662
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,520
I was in the French tonight. You were told they were, you know, they, they probably were saying,

663
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,760
you have to go to the back stage door. The back stage door is there. You aren't you in the show?

664
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,800
We weren't in the show. She had a new good shoot shoot. What did you say?

665
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Well, we went with the train by train. As we say, pardon me, ma'am.

666
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,440
Is that the cat the shit on your shoe?

667
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:31,080
Oh, yeah. Okay. So, but in general, it was good. And in your dad, he was, he, the

668
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,360
morning he said, I was stoned. He said he was completely stoned because the music

669
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,760
got into his head. And he was, he was separate. I can see it. He was separating the arrangements.

670
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,760
Oh, yeah. He was listening to every single bit. Edge of his chair. Only staring at the orchestra.

671
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,520
Yeah. That's right. And he, just to see my dad, and that's where we, we went actually,

672
00:41:52,520 --> 00:42:00,120
to see my dad enjoyed the so much. Nice, huh? So much. I know that was just, that was the most

673
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:06,440
beautiful part of the evening. Hey, Adam. This is Jeff. Just out of Nashville. Can I see?

674
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,440
I was calling this message, actually, is for Christina begging her to start her own show.

675
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:19,160
Because I live in Nashville near Nashville, which is a town full of shitty music. They're very

676
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:26,840
few rareties here that are actually good, such as Matthew Eagle. And anyway, I need to know about

677
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:33,880
some good music. So please, please, I beg you, start your own show. Thank you very much.

678
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,120
Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Everyone from Nashville to go thank you very much. I think

680
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:51,240

681
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,680
No, I didn't eat anything. Did you eat my French food? I did. I had the generic brand of corn flakes.

682
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:04,120
I thought I didn't even like it. Oh, did you eat the white? Hey, did you eat it? No, she didn't

687
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:32,520
near Nashville, which is a town full of shitty music. They're very few rareties here that are

691
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,800
Christina's really worried about, well, will I be boring? I don't think you'll be boring.

692
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,520
I am kind of boring. Just talk about the vanilla stuff your mom stole in eight.
