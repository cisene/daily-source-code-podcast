To me

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
So

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Day by day free to choose a life

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Putting people's heads at the top

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
There's no fuss in situation

17
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Change in the heart of just one

18
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Don't give it out

19
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
To the face

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
And the force around us

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
We

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Between the end and the outside

23
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,200
So take a stand

24
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
In this place

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Because we're the building of our own future

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Just know my love

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Day by day free to choose a life

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,200
It's better for more

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
So take a stand

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
In this place

31
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Because we're the building of our own future

32
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Just know my love

33
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Day by day free to choose a life

34
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,200
It's better for more

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
So take a stand

36
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
In this place

37
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Because we're the building of our own future

38
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Just know my love

39
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Day by day free to choose a life

40
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
It's better for more

41
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Is it just me or does this song have that?

42
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
That very distinct holiday vibe to it

43
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Sure sounds like it's a me

44
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Building our own future

45
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
How this is how it sounds

46
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
And this is the daily source code

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Adam Curry

48
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
That guy so smart

49
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
He knows how it works

50
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Send out pros to everybody

51
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
And don't play the song

52
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Absolutely

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
It's Friday everybody

54
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
We are completely food bar

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
I speak not only for myself

56
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,200
But about 58 other people who work at pod show

57
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Been completely

58
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Well, they've just been boss the wall

59
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
All the way to the wire for the past 30

60
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm sorry, 56 hours

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Give or take a couple

62
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
As I look now at my sky presence

63
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Indicators still lots of engineers online

64
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Even though they're on well

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
I guess they may they may live in San Francisco

66
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
But there's certainly no longer on San Francisco time

67
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
And so we're all kind of fucked up beyond repair

68
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
But things are going well

69
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
It is Friday it is the daily source code episode

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Four nine or four coming to you from the Curry Cottage

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
And the affluent suburb of Surrey

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Yesterday of course we had the lady Patricia

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
So yeah when I got one lady on

74
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,200
I can't really have another one to close by

75
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
I can't really have another one to close by

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Amy Mack

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
It's here too

78
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Trim the ens

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
The next time the lady comes on it'll be great

80
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Adam

81
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Amy Mack

82
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Hey baby

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm sure you've heard enough of my voice this week

84
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
But again today

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Never enough

86
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Never enough Amy

87
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I've had as much fun watching the process

88
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I did hosting it

89
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Real fantastic

90
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
And everyone has had an exhausting week

91
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
But that means that more than ever before

92
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
We need to ask your son

93
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Yes

94
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Yes

95
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
What are we doing

96
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Rive your wireless and get ready

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Oh, okay

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Hold on a second

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
All right

100
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
All right, I'm ready

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Doing side lunges

102
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Side lunges

103
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
So you're going to start standing tall with your feet together

104
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Okay

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Now you're going to take a great big step to the left

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
To the left

107
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Then the left knee and bring your arms down to the left ankle

108
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm not going to do this

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
It's like right leg straight as you can

110
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Okay

111
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Now come back up to the standing position with feet together

112
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Okay

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
We're going to do the right one

114
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Now to the right

115
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Right leg out wide

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Right knee bends

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Arms down for the right ankle

118
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
And up

119
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I know you've seen your button stomach to get back up

120
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
So I'm not even going through mine

121
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm sorry

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Yeah, yes I am

123
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Keep going

124
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
On the night water go on each side

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Due to those long legs

126
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
I'll let you count

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Squeeze that vibe

128
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Yes

129
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
This is a good stretch for your upper body

130
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
And it's a great workout for your legs

131
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
And of course we're sculpting the booty

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
As abs finishes

133
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
I want to remind everyone that fitness attack

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
And Spanish will launch

135
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Translated by the fabulous mark to bloom

136
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
You can find all my shows at fitness.potshow.com

137
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Hey

138
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Great job Adam

139
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
That bud is really coming along

140
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I think that out for the holidays

141
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I might be able to release you and do it once a month's check it

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Oh no

143
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
But then maybe we should start working on abs

144
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
We could call it Adam's abs exercise

145
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Hmm

146
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Well the name might need a moment away

147
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Yeah really

148
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Anyway, my weekly work is done

149
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Until next time

150
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Thank you Amy Mack

151
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Yeah, I remember those

152
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
I've done lots of lunges in my life

153
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
When I was fencing

154
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I only didn't do that to the side

155
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
You didn't forward

156
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
But yep, I remember

157
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I can get the feelings coming back

158
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
You know

159
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Amy

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
I think I need to see

161
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
What

162
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
What episode was this?

163
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
12?

164
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Let me just check

165
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
14 already, crap

166
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I think I need at least six more

167
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
I think we need to take it to 20

168
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
That's for sure

169
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Oh this is a nice place here

170
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
It's real spiffy

171
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I know you guys

172
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I don't like spiffy

173
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Hey

174
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
So you're Adam curry

175
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Incha

176
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Yeah

177
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
What about you?

178
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Well let me introduce myself

179
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
My name's Joey

180
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
And these are my associates

181
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Many tree hands

182
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
And fat Tony

183
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Tony he's a little too much

184
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
This is a nice place

185
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
You got here this podshow.com

186
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
It's real classy

187
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
I like classy

188
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,200
But for being such a nice place

189
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Mr. Curry

190
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
It's an awfully rough neighborhood

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
I mean being on the internet

192
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
You know

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
You have to worry about hackers and viruses

194
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
And what?

195
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Not clogging your tubes

196
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
That's why me and the boys here

197
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,200
We put together a little security protection agency

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
For just a few dollars a day

199
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
We'll make sure that

200
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Almost nothing bad happens to you

201
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Now you can make payment

202
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
In the alley

203
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Next to the angry geek.com

204
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Just leave your payment in small

205
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Unmarked bills in a little suitcase behind the dumpster

206
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh, Mr. Curry

207
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
If you decide to back out of this little financial arrangement we've entered into

208
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Why don't I just show you why we call him many tree hands

209
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Hey Vinnie

210
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Show him that hand you got

211
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
No Vinnie

212
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Not your left hand

213
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
The hand you wear around your neck

214
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Fucking war

215
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Yes that hand Vinnie

216
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Please show it to Mr. Curry

217
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Anyway Mr. Curry

218
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
As you can see he has a severed hand around his neck

219
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
That's a hand of the last podcaster that didn't

220
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Honor our financial arrangements

221
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
You can put it away now Vinnie

222
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes, I'm sure you can put it away now Vinnie

223
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Thank you

224
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
He's a sick bastard he really is

225
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
But we keep him around anyway

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
You know he gets the job done

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
That and what we get the fire

228
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Anyway Mr. Curry

229
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
You want our financial arrangement today

230
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
And we'll make sure nothing bad before you

231
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
You have a good day Mr. Curry

232
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Come on boys. Let's say I'm scary

233
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
You guys are just too kind

234
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
So before I could even mention it

235
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Already phone calls coming in

236
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
You know I'm getting into the holiday spirit

237
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
We've got the cold crisp air outside

238
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Today not a great flying day

239
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Hopefully tomorrow or Sunday

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I am planning on crossing the channel again

241
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
But as I said it's the holiday season

242
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
That's why you know the Howard Jones tune kind of a little bit of holiday vibe

243
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Even though I don't know if it was meant as a holiday vibe record

244
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
But it kind of gave me that vibe

245
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
And yeah, you know what I'm waiting for this time of year

246
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Which I'm under frequent listening

247
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Probably more frequent caller

248
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm listening to that time of year

249
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Were you going to start knocking on about

250
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Bloody egg nog

251
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Which is you know

252
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
American thing

253
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Make sure you check out

254
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
The wine

255
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Believe it's called Mama Uniformly

256
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
My Lima Echo Delta

257
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I'll never get it the English stuff

258
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Make sure you check that out because it's good stuff

259
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Fight

260
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
From Bernie's world at burnewsworldcast.podshow.com

261
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
A couple of weeks ago

262
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I sent your tune for footballer Friday

263
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
And I screwed it up

264
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Sent you something that was footballer

265
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
And you played in any way

266
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Then last week I sent you an intro

267
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
That goofed on you

268
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
And that whole go daddy domain name thing

269
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
That was good

270
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
You turned around and you took it

271
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
You laid it over the first song of the footballer Friday show

272
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
And you made it from some half baked

273
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Homemade intro into something

274
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
That sounded really awesome

275
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
So I kind of owe you

276
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I wanted to send just the right tune

277
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
For footballer Friday this week

278
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I have an instrumental for you

279
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
And if you like hard rock and guitar solos

280
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Funky bass and heavy metal jams

281
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Then this instrumental is for you

282
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
All right

283
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
It's called Screaming Chicken

284
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
It's by Jobo

285
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
It's on the Podsafe music network

286
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
And it's got everything you're looking for

287
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
For footballer Friday except for one thing

288
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
It needs more cowbell

289
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
So here's Screaming Chicken by Jobo

290
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
No problem

291
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I got to it

292
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
You

293
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200

296
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
You

297
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
You

299
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
You

300
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
You

301
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
You

302
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
You

303
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
You

304
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
You

305
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
You

306
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
You

307
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
You

308
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
You

309
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
You

310
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
You

311
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
You

312
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
You

313
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
You

314
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
You

315
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
You

316
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
You

317
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
You

318
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
You

319
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
You

320
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
You

321
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
You

322
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
You

323
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
You

324
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
You

325
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
You

326
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
You

327
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
You

328
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
You

329
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
You

330
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
You

331
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
You

332
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
You

333
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
You

334
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
You

335
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200

You

343
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
You

344
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
You

345
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
You

346
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
You

347
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
You

348
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
You

349
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
You

350
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
You

351
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
You

352
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
You

353
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Take it all

354
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Damn

355
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
That is excellent

356
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
You

357
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
You

358
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,960
jam that is instrumental. Don't play a lot of those on the Charlie, but yeah, like it. Dude, thank you so much.

359
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip,

360
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,680
CSB sent in an audio comment. I've not listened to it myself. Actually, I had lost it.

361
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,920
I put it in a wrong folder somewhere and if you see my desktop right now, it's just filled with

362
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,600
crap and I used Google Google Desktop search and bam, turns out I had thrown it into my

363
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,080
documents folder, but it popped up immediately. Do love that Google Desktop search.

364
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
So let's listen to this for the first time together, shall we?

365
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,920
Hiya, Adam Curry. You are aviation freak, so you may be know how critical, so called

366
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:58,080
Battle of Britain was. This battle took place between UK and Germany in the air only.

367
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,520
So here is a young-polette style question. He loves of what nationality, where second?

368
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,960
Did you say penis or pilots? Most effective in this battle after Englishmen?

369
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Oh, how about a Polish? It's a battle of Britain, do you know?

370
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,160
Polish? Well, these were Native Americans, no scots. These were Paul. I told you my compatriots.

371
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:33,360
After EU announcement, in 2004, over 500,000 Pauls emigrated to UK. So now, birds are scared and close.

372
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Temporarily, work market for buggerians or minions, the new EU citizens from next year.

373
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,040
However, the point system for emigrants, that your soil mate Patricia mentioned,

374
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,960
does not apply to EU citizens at all, but to people from outside of EU. Good.

375
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,560
So for example, people from Asia, you know. Partition was right after all, but of course, EU citizens

376
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,560
have no limits at all, and this point system doesn't apply to them.

377
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:16,800
So, by the way, I am launching a video blog on the domain www.smartphone.tv, and I'm pondering which video

378
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,880
hosting service should I use, which is the best. Do you have any suggestions? Bye-bye, Adam.

379
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,040
Yo. Well, yo yourself, CSB. Interesting. First of all, we look at smartphone.tv.

380
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,360
Coming soon, and it will be blog with videos about smartphones. Yo.

381
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,160
Dude, uh, you can use, um, podshow plus for that. What did you expect me to say anything different?

382
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,720
Podshow plus now also under videos allows you to upload a single video and create a viral video

383
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,640
out of it with an embed code and all that groovy stuff. So that would be one way, or you could upload

384
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,720
those, and you'll be able to add them to feed. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff that that we've

385
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,040
put in all kinds of neat little things under the hood that I'm waiting for you guys to discover.

386
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,680
Now, about the Polish pilots, uh, commonster blogger, I actually didn't know that. I am an aviation,

387
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:16,880
and I didn't know that the Polish pilots, pilots contributed to the battle. But actually,

388
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,920
they were going to help a couple more important battles during the Second World War,

389
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,040
but the Polish Air Force ran out of coal, unfortunately. Sorry about that, dude.

390
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:37,600
All right, you're on hard like to present Sir Jersey Todd. Now, Sir Jersey Todd is the most

391
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,880
badass learner in podcasting. So you can be sure he won't be saving any damsels into stress.

392
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,840
He'll be chasing behind the ambulance on horseback, waiting to sue the asses off the dragons that

393
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
are in jail.

394
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Just in time, yeah, just in time, yeah, yeah

395
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,840
You're on a what he said, we might even win this case

396
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Just in time, yeah, just in time, yeah, yeah

397
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:46,840
Just in time, yeah, just in time, yeah

398
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Yo, what's up, AC?

399
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Jersey tied the official Nighted Musicologist of The Delloy Source code

400
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,840
And I just want to thank the great and amazing Jim Armstrong from Sonic Delloy Records

401
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,840
For his cover of Jeff Smith's Jersey tied theme song

402
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
I mean, how cool is that?

403
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Anyway, Adam, listen, the elections are over here in the States

404
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
And I finally can come out and say how upset I was

405
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
About all of the negative campaigning here in Jersey

406
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
I mean, please, New Jersey get such a reputation

407
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,400
New Jersey gets such a reputation

408
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,800
of having corrupt officials and places of power.

409
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,440
And let me just say this.

410
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,240
New Jerseyans are not people who take bribes,

411
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,400
we are not corrupt,

412
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,280
and we are not otherwise easily influenced.

413
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,160
All right, I just had to get that off my chest.

414
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
All right, listen, I'm cool.

415
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,200
Today on the Cha Cha,

416
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
I'd like to bring you one of my favorite artists,

417
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,560
the great and amazing Jim Armstrong

418
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,080
from Sonic Deli Records.

419
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Hey, how about that?

420
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,800
And it's song Angel in our corner,

421
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
that you're gonna like it a lot.

422
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,200
It's a great food bar song,

423
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
and have some fun and I'll see you around.

424
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,840
We all need Angel in our corner,

425
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,400
and we all need a good friend to warn us.

426
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,520
Something's just strong,

427
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,160
just like a supermarket man.

428
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,320
We love a good man,

429
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,800
but I don't really think it's gonna be like that.

430
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,840
Sometimes it's so long,

431
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,440
just yet a break of stuff,

432
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,880
and you play it about me and bring it back to you.

433
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,880
We all need Angel in our corner,

434
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,560
we all need Angel in our corner,

435
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,280
we all need Angel in our corner,

436
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,520
we all need Angel in our corner,

437
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,240
we all need Angel in our corner,

438
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,520
we all need Angel in our corner,

439
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,080
we all need Angel in our corner,

440
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,440
we all need Angel in our corner,

441
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,000
we all need Angel in our corner,

442
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,560
we all need Angel in our corner,

443
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,680
we all need Angel in our corner,

444
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,320
we all need Angel in our corner,

445
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Baby, I can't remember if we all be

446
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,320
If you're in our corner

447
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Can we all be

448
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Friends of all of us

449
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
We all need

450
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,320
If you're in our corner

451
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Can we all be

452
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,320
If you're in our corner

453
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Can we all be

454
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
We all need

455
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
We all need

456
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
We all need

457
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
We all need

458
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
We all need

459
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
We all need

460
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
We all need

461
00:23:33,320 --> 00:24:03,320
And we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are

462
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:25,920
leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving.

463
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving, and we are leaving.

464
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,040
Well, I think that makes it official.

465
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,480
This is probably the longest promo ever run on the daily source code, Jersey Todd

466
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
often vacation.

467
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I hope I'll be back for next week, and I have to say I'm a little bit envious of that

468
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
song.

469
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
It's an awesome one, dude.

470
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Congrats.

471
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,080
Fubar Faday continues with something, actually, I think I should make a regular

472
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
feature.

473
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,560
It's a little bit on the long side, but I wouldn't mind having more of these sent in.

474
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,160
Maybe just once a week or once every other week.

475
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,840
I remember I was talking about Jennifer Yenolo from Food Philosophy.

476
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,680
Actually, she was racking on me, and then she did me to a cook-off, like that's really

477
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
going to work.

478
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:23,160
I can cook, but I can't cook, like anyone named Yenolo saying, but I have a secret weapon.

479
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,560
Hey Adam, it's Chef Mark in New York.

480
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,520
I heard the little slap down my friend Jennifer Yenolo gave you for mangling her name,

481
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,840
and the recipe thrown down she challenged you to.

482
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,240
I figured since she really knows her way around the kitchen, you might need a little

483
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,000
help in your corner.

484
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,880
Since the remarkable pilot podcast is now the newest show on the Potio PDN, I can step in

485
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,200
and help you out.

486
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,760
Here's a little recipe you might use with splendor flavor blends to bring to the

487
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
throwdown with Jennifer.

488
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Okay.

489
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,720
I call this strawberry, French vanilla and Napoleon.

490
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,800
You'll need some frozen pre-made pup pastry shells, some ricotta cheese, fresh strawberries,

491
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,360
and a few packets of French vanilla splendor flavor blend.

492
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,840
Now, you know what's great about this is you can keep this show on your mobile device.

493
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,360
And when you're shopping, you can stop it and you can rewind it and listen to the ingredients

494
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,800
and then as you're preparing this wonderful dish of which I forgot in the name, we need

495
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,080
a snappy or name, Marks, sorry, snappy or name.

496
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,320
Then you can actually do the same thing.

497
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
It'll work.

498
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Trust me.

499
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,560
After vanilla flavored splendor into about 3-4 cups of softened ricotta cheese, be sure

500
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,560
to blend it really well, make it smooth and creamy, and get it to just the sweetness

501
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
you like.

502
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,440
If you like it even richer and creamier, use muscarpone cheese and a hand blender to whip

503
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
it.

504
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,560
Slice your strawberries or whatever fresh fruit you'd like and set them aside.

505
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,160
Next, you're going to bake off a couple of pre-cut frozen pup pastry shells in the oven.

506
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,200
You can get these in the freezer case of most grocery stores.

507
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,720
When they've cooled, carefully divide them into two or three layers.

508
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,240
Spread a little of the vanilla cream over the bottom layer, line up a few slices of strawberries

509
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,720
so that they just peek out the edges and then top with a second layer of the pup pastry.

510
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,320
Repeat with more cream and strawberries and then top with the last layer of pup pastry.

511
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,480
You of course, you can substitute raspberries for the strawberries, but always get something

512
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,520
that's fresh and in-season, or you can use one of the other flavor blends as well.

513
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,160
If you want to get a little fancy, you can even pure some raspberries with a little splendor

514
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,960
and a squeeze of lemon juice.

515
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,360
Push it through a fine mesh sieve to get rid of the seeds and voila!

516
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,440
You have a sweet and bright raspberry cule to drizzle over your dessert.

517
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,800
And that, my friend, is how you meet a recipe throw down.

518
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,160
Don't tell Jennifer I help you out or she'll lock me in the root cellar with the kitchen

519
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
elves.

520
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Ah!

521
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
We're all waiting for you, chef.

522
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,280
Hey, keep it down in there.

523
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,560
I'll make you chop more onion.

524
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
No!

525
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,400
Anyway, out of check out remarkablepalott.potcho.com.

526
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,440
On my latest show, I interviewed Chef Mingxai at an actual cranberry bog that they built

527
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,840
into Rockefeller Center.

528
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Ah!

529
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,840
By the way, the elves crunch, but I most definitely full.

530
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Yeah.

531
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
See you later, buddy.

532
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,120
You know, Chef Mark, I think we can do this as a regular feature, but we got to change

533
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,960
the production a little bit.

534
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,040
As much as I appreciate that you put this music together, we really need something more

535
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,120
like, let me see if there you go.

536
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,120
And nowadays, I'm done, man, it is time for the one and only matrimarch.

537
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,560
Our chef fixed, rodna, to bring you today's recipe of the week.

538
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,000
Chef Mark is all yours.

539
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,200
And then you come in and you say, today we have the vaging surprise.

540
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Oh, good.

541
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,760
For something like that.

542
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,760
And then we could end it every single time with, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

543
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,760
But bon appetit!

544
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Fuck me.

545
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
I didn't work the way I wanted it to.

546
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,680
Adam, I know you've read playboy magazine, so you've probably seen the advisor column.

547
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,840
And the advisor, uh, one of the best known and off-bread features of playboy magazine is also

548
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,000
one of the most popular advice columns in the world, with more than 10 million readers in

549
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
14 countries.

550
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,200
And the actual playboy advisor himself, my buddy, Chip Ro, senior editor of the magazine,

551
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,200
is on Pacific Coast Highway this Friday talking about the book, the column, and a whole lot

552
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
more.

553
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,960
In fact, Chip talks about so much great stuff on the show that I had to break the interview

554
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
up into two parts.

555
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,560
Well, the first part, dropping on Friday, at Pacific CoastHellway.podgeow.com.

556
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,240
And of course, I had to ask Chip, what was the craziest weirdest letter he ever got

557
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
as the playboy advisor?

558
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
And this is what he told me.

559
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,400
Well, I can have a few favorites.

560
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,720
The one that always comes up first is the guy who dragged the lazy boy out into the woods,

561
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,240
and he would go sit in it naked and spray a bug spray all over himself except his genitals.

562
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,160
And you can go back to people in a minute to let that digest.

563
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,720
And his question was basically, is this, is this normal?

564
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,840
And if you want to know how the playboy advisor answered that question, well, you'll just have

565
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,120
to check out the interview at Pacific CoastHellway.

566
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
So thanks, Adam.

567
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
And you know what?

568
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,120
I'm going to be sending you a copy of the Deer Playboy advisor book for Christmas along

569
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
with a box of tissues, because I know you're going to dig it.

570
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,120
I'll catch you later.

571
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,520
Yo, Mark.

572
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,640
Cool deal, man.

573
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,560
So that's today, then, I guess, that it goes up, right?

574
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,480
Oh, about Chef Mark, I almost forgot to say, ladies.

575
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
He's dreamy.

576
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Hey, everyone.

577
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
This is Eugene tomorrow.

578
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,360
My question for you is this.

579
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,160
How long have you been with your internet service provider?

580
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,600
How many times have you switched?

581
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,600
My internet service provider is EarthLink, and I have been with them as a subscriber since

582
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,800
April 17, 1998.

583
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:49,080
Now, that's a long time before anyone had ever heard of iPods or podcasting or even cable

584
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,080
or DSL broadband.

585
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,360
For over eight years now, I have relied on EarthLink for internet connectivity and spam

586
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,680
for email, and they have never let me down.

587
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,400
If you are tired of bad service, inconsistent connectivity, constantly rising prices and email

588
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:11,720
accounts full of spam, come on over where I am, EarthLink.net, go to www.EarthLink.net, and

589
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,520
you can get a great deal on internet service.

590
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,880
I got to go double check.

591
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,920
I think the EarthLink campaign ends this week.

592
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
I'm not quite sure.

593
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,120
Oh, maybe it's till the end of the month.

594
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
I got to find out.

595
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Of course, go Daddy continues.

596
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,480
It looks like we're working on some really cool with go Daddy.

597
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
I wish I could tell you.

598
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,280
I don't think the deal has been signed yet, but I wish I could tell you what it's going

599
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
to be.

600
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,520
A fucking awesome promotion.

601
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,440
And of course, we still have the current go Daddy promotion.

602
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,960
If you want a great deal on domain name, 695 for a year, go to godaddy.com and use

603
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,000
check out code DSC3 for all your domain name.

604
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,280
And now a word from our sponsor.

605
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
It's the Yanks.

606
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
This is the Brits.

607
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,880
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's apparent to see that just like

608
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,280
you and me, it's the Yanks.

609
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,840
And the Brits, the Yanks versus the Brits.

610
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
Mind the game.

611
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I don't know.

612
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,800
I just had as you were talking on them in a day,

613
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,720
Daddy's supposed to come in because I said, and I heard you mentioned the sort of

614
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,320
comparison between UK, not UK, European Union, United States, and people in New Jersey.

615
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,080
You're going to like other states for work.

616
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,400
Now, I think what you mean, and I agree with you, I think it's a big deal.

617
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,000
But you can't quite make the comparison between European Union and United States.

618
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
They are different.

619
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,920
Well, they are still the independent nations, we're not going to serve the words anymore.

620
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,240
I mean, I don't even have to say it's probably that the states are to a point that I don't

621
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
have the right.

622
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
But they are not the same thing.

623
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,760
So, not quite as like, I'd like to look at your, I think, that people have won, we want

624
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
to come here.

625
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Yeah.

626
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
You can imagine.

627
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
It'd be nice if you got it something.

628
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,560
Anyway, it's mentioned in recent times, come like that.

629
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,360
Okay, I didn't understand any of the last half of that, except that the comparison

630
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:07,040
of New York, New Jersey, UK and other European states is not equitable, not equivalent.

631
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
There you go.

632
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Can you tell them football?

633
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,200
I got a green kind of disagree with you.

634
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,720
First of all, why do you call it a state if it isn't a state?

635
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,840
And as far as comparisons go, New York and New Jersey, it's like two different places.

636
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,240
We talk differently, we have different money and New Jersey are money is a little bit more

637
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
greysier.

638
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,960
Yeah, I mean, different countries, Texas, Texas is a whole different country from New York

639
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
and New Jersey.

640
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,680
So, there isn't all that much difference as far as I'm concerned.

641
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,640
And still, you can move around pretty freely.

642
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,720
Music by the Jim Offerman band, Russell Wolfe, and Marx says hi on the next edition of

643
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,680
the Pot-Safe Treasures Podcast.

644
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm Eugene T. Roya Join us, download the program at potsafetreasures.potshow.com.

645
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,680
You know, if you haven't seen it, BTpotshow.com is launched now in the UK.

646
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,640
You can get to it from anywhere and you'll see the subtle differences between potshow.com

647
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
and BTpotshow.com.

648
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,520
One of them being some of the shows that we have running there, you have to check out

649
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,120
the International Sex Therapist, Dr. Cockney.

650
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,760
You'll find them right there in the home page.

651
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,720
This show is fucking awesome.

652
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,520
Think a white ballboard art.

653
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Not that board art isn't white, but you know what I'm saying?

654
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,280
Roaming the streets of London as the International Sex Therapist and really giving us

655
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,840
an eye-opener and a deep probe into English culture, English sexual culture.

656
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,360
I think he also has a Potshow site.

657
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,760
What is it? International Sex Therapist.potshow.com?

658
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,960
Yeah, probably something like that.

659
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,000
And for all the talking I was doing about this thing called Goose Inc.

660
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,160
Goose Inc.

661
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,200
Which allows you to synchronize your Google calendar, which I use along with my

662
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
Gmail onto your mobile phone.

663
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,600
I couldn't get this thing to work.

664
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,760
It was supposed to send me authentication message and I didn't.

665
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,440
And then I said, well, just delete your profile and start it.

666
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
It just didn't work.

667
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,040
And then I got an email from Otto Heldemann and Otto pointed me to gcalsink.com.

668
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,120
Which is an open source Java application.

669
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,520
So it'll run on your Java phone, which the Nokia E61 handles quite nicely.

670
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,120
So gcalsink is golf Charlie Alpholimus Chero.

671
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,520
Yankee November Charlie dot com installed it, worked right off the bat, synchronized

672
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
in my calendars.

673
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,800
I haven't been able to get it to write up to the Google calendar only to pull down

674
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
from the Google calendar, which is kind of a drawback.

675
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
But maybe I'm not doing something right or maybe there's another version coming along.

676
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We'll do that.

677
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm sure.

678
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,040
But it's definitely something you want to check out if you have a Java capable

679
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
phone.

680
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Join Dawn and Drew as the interview BT composer, songwriter, and DJ extraordinaire.

681
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,240
We'll talk about his new project, this binary universe.

682
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,600
And all sorts of other crazy things that you won't hear anywhere else.

683
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,000
It'll be November 13th over at DonAndrew.com.

684
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Don't miss it.

685
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,040
You know, um,

686
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,400
check out my new album, this binary universe, and you're listening to the Don and Drew

687
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,560
showed check it out.

688
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,400
They got chicken.

689
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,600
Yes, they do.

690
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,800
I was cruising through the positive music network.

691
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,560
You know, as I did yesterday, when I just found my chemical romance, and I found this

692
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,880
outfit from, um, well, she doesn't say with her from, I wonder.

693
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,200
Well, their name is area phonics, and let me just read from the bio here.

694
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Area phonics is created a totally new music style by combining elements of classical crossover

695
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,800
with moods close to 70s conceptual albums on this groundbreaking album.

696
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:48,360
Modern electronic sounds are combined with the lyricism of Italian aria.

697
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,240
And actually, I was going to play this song first.

698
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,520
Let me see if I can just pop this up for you, just so you can hear a little bit.

699
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm playing it directly from the web browser at music.podshow.com.

700
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,200
And I kind of thought I was interesting because it was listed as genre was opera.

701
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,320
And it's titled Sposason Distresatta.

702
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,720
I still kick my ass, which I hear is my pronunciation.

703
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,000
And I thought that was, uh, that by itself was pretty cool.

704
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,440
But then I found this other track they have, which, to me, was just such a fantastic

705
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
mashup.

706
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:31,080
And it's actually legal, so I want to listen to this one.

707
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,960
The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste.

708
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
They have absolutely no taste.

709
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,160
They have absolutely no taste.

710
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,240
Not only is it's common, but it's still new.

711
00:37:44,240 --> 00:38:01,040
No taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste.

712
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,040
They don't think of original ideas and they don't bring much culture into their product.

713
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:19,520
No taste, no smell, no taste, no smell, no taste, no smell, no taste, no smell, no taste.

714
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Just killing from me.

715
00:38:47,120 --> 00:39:02,920
No taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste, no taste.

716
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,260
Just killing from me.

717
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,760
Just killing from me.

718
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:16,760
No taste, no taste, no taste, no taste.

719
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:26,760
Good on it's coffee, and there's still.

720
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Are you in version?

721
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
You're still in version.

722
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
You just think you're not.

723
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,760
No taste, no taste, no taste.

724
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,760
No taste, no taste.

725
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,760
No taste, no taste.

726
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,760
No taste, no taste.

727
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Better than you are.

728
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,760
That doesn't matter.

729
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Excellent.

730
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,760
I'm not quite sure what the version thing was doing in there all of a sudden, but I liked it a lot.

731
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,760
I just realized that we're missing an important link.

732
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,760
If you haven't seen it yet, we had now have really the audience facing side of the

733
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
positive music network.

734
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,760
If you go to patchart.com slash music or just hit in the music tab anywhere.

735
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
You'll see that we have all these artists pages.

736
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,760
We've now brought it out into the forefront.

737
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,760
You can get an artist and put it into your collection.

738
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
It'll play in the dashboard.

739
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,760
You can't download it, but you can play it in the dashboard.

740
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,760
You can get an embeddable player of your favorite artists.

741
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,760
All of their tracks will then appear on the page that you put that code into.

742
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
And you can play it right from that page.

743
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,760
So there's just a whole bunch of things that we've done, but there's no connection from the

744
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,760
really the producer side, the podcast or side, which is the pod save music network.

745
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Now I've got to go find the link on the music side of podshow.com.

746
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,760
So I can paste that in because that's really what you want to be.

747
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Which you want to be looking at.

748
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Certainly as a listener.

749
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,760
And then of course, so we need it the other way around.

750
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,760
So if you're a producer or a podcaster or anything you find on podshow.com slash music,

751
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,760
you should also be able to click that and add it to your play list or something like that.

752
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
That's something I still got to work on.

753
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,760
As we have to work on many, many things.

754
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
But we're getting there.

755
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,760
I think over the weekend we'll really clear up most of the big buggies.

756
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,760
And then we can go towards rolling out more of the video stuff.

757
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:38,760
And please, you've got to check out what we've done for the podcas producers.

758
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
You know what?

759
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
I am indeed quite footballer.

760
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
I don't get it today.

761
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
It's Friday.

762
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday.

763
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Food about Friday.

764
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Add a spinal fund for the week.

765
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Well, for the final thought of the week.

766
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Yesterday, I did a show with the lovely lady Patricia.

767
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,760
And I actually listened back to it in the car.

768
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
I was running a couple of errands.

769
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Yeah, I'd like to listen to shows once more.

770
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Particularly Patricia's on and I can kind of see how the vibe was.

771
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,760
And I have to say that I'm going to try and improve myself a little bit.

772
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
It's been incredibly busy the past few weeks.

773
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,760
I've been sleep deprived along with all of my colleagues.

774
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,760
But Patricia had some very valid points.

775
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,760
She said, hey, you're just not in the good mood.

776
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,760
And I thought to myself, that really sucks.

777
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Even though I'm really tired and even though things aren't going exactly the way I wanted to go,

778
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,760
I should be a lot nicer.

779
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,760
And so the next time you're feeling shitty, tired, food barred,

780
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,760
remember those who love you and who really are just doing everything they can to support you.

781
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,760
And the only thing you have to do is just flash them a smile.

782
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,760
I know.

783
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
It worked for me last night.

784
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
And Tuesday, Wednesday.

785
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
Thursday, full by Friday.

786
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,760
And I'm spinal thought on the reef.

787
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,760
On my cast, last night.

788
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
That's it for me, everybody.

789
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Have a great weekend.

790
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,760
I'll be back here on Monday with a more crap.

791
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Bye-bye.

792
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Another pod show podcast.

793
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Stick it in your ear.

794
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Get this pod cast and we're great ones like it on the high performance pod cast

795
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,760
delivery network from Podshow and line-white networks.

796
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
I love it.
