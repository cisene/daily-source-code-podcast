00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,760
Dildesiro Charlie 4.5 Niner

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,280
No, no, no, you think it is.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,800
If the Dildesiro Charlie 4.5 Niner.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Yeah, no.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
With the very nice Adam Curry.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,640
Don't like him.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,520
And sometimes the lovely Patricia Pi.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,880
Nice Terts.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
Dildesiro Charlie 4.5 Niner.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,240
But forget that number.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,040
This is the first Charlie of the rest of your life.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,040
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,040
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Hey, everybody.

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
It is the Daily Source Code.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
That's a surprise.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Wait a minute.

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
No Pod Safe Song to start off the show.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
That's right.

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Because we're going to do something different today.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,040
While the entire world I'm sure is talking about September the 11th.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,040
We're going to talk about stupid stuff on Skype from Portland.

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Portland.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Portland.

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
Portland.

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,040
It's my friend Ken Clark.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Kenster J.

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Who I haven't spoken to in what can a year.

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Do I?

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Am I on?

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
It's working.

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
It's working.

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
You're on, baby.

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
You're fine.

39
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,040
He had to teach me how to use the new version of Skype.

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
It had been a while.

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
It's been so long.

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,040
I don't have the latest version of Skype months.

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
Six months, maybe.

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Yeah.

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Well, of course, we've had some email contact.

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Actually, I tried calling yourself phone last night.

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Because I thought that yesterday was Sunday.

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Silly me.

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
I was going to bust you up.

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
And I don't know what number I have.

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
But I got like some answering machine that was in Spanish.

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
That would not have been mine.

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Well, no, but the person who I called was nice enough to call back.

54
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I guess I got my number from caller ID.

55
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
And I'm like, hello.

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Hello.

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
No, no, no, no, no.

58
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,040
What's your name?

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Come on.

60
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Go ahead.

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Tell me.

62
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
You can't pretend.

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
No, Ken Clark.

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
No, Ken Clark.

65
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
No, Ken Clark.

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
A little background on Ken.

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,040
For those of you who joined the daily source code in the past six months, I guess.

68
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Like Ken and I go way back to when I first started MTV in 1987.

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
87.

70
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
87.

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Yes.

72
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Ken was the director of on air talent.

73
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Well, is it was that the title, Ken?

74
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Or was it at that point?

75
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,040
I think I was like the VGA coordinator.

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Right.

77
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
The director ship probably came later.

78
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Yeah.

79
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
It's like, give me my coffee.

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Ken bitch.

81
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Now.

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,040
But Ken had already been there for what five or six years before.

83
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
I even got there.

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Ken.

85
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,040
I started in New Year's Eve, 1984 and 1984.

86
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Okay.

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
So three years.

88
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Three years.

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Good.

90
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
Yeah.

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,040
And over the past two years on the daily source code from time to time,

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Ken and I will catch up for something called the MTV Chronicles.

93
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,040
And we'll just, you know, talk about some crap about old times.

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,040
And I think sometimes it has something to do with MTV, sometimes it doesn't.

95
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
That's true.

96
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Well, in this case.

97
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Right.

98
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
In this case, there are actually two reasons for us to do another MTV Chronicles.

99
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Although it will also be just kind of an update in general.

100
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,040
The first one was the 25th anniversary of MTV, which of course passed by very silently from the MTV side.

101
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,040
And Ken is much more ingrained in the MTV alumni community.

102
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,040
I've, I've no one ever emailed me.

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
I'm completely shunned.

104
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,040
The alumni, the alumni mailing list.

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
There was a five year cut off.

106
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,040
If you were with MTV within the first five years, you made the list.

107
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Oh, really?

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Oh, I didn't know that.

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Okay.

110
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
And I, I was in there.

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
I started out in a three and a half, four years in.

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
So I, you were just on the other side of the cut off for the alumni list.

113
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,040
You know, it's so often that I'll read in the, in a newspaper or in an,

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,040
in any kind of mainstream publication, you know, Adam Curry,

115
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
one of the first VJs.

116
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm like, man, you know, first of all, obviously they're not doing research,

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,040
but it must really bug like the original guys that, you know,

118
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I don't know if any of them care anymore.

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Yeah, of course they do.

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Of course they do.

121
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,040
They're pretty laid back about it.

122
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Yeah, but I mean, you just like fuck, you know, it's just irritating.

123
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,040
They could say early MTV VJ.

124
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
And that would be relatively true.

125
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Yeah, but it's funny to think that, but if you look at 25 years,

126
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,040
you were there from like five to 10 or 11 or 12 years into MTV's life.

127
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Yeah, you would have been an early MTV.

128
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Well, what happened was, just as I came into MTV,

129
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,040
they were going to 40 million households.

130
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Remember, we still had to do a lot of sucking up to cable companies.

131
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,040
We had to go blow them and go do like they were coming.

132
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,040
They were going to send their grandchildren and their advertisers.

133
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Kids down to the studio to meet Adam Curry.

134
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Like there was some no redstone themselves.

135
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,040
You know, they've got some some cable company in Botfuck.

136
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,040
And like, you know, and at that point, they really were just like,

137
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
cable, you know, trench diggers.

138
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Didn't we call them trench diggers, too, at the time?

139
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,040
We got some more trench diggers coming through with a grand kid.

140
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
Remember that?

141
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
No, frankly.

142
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Oh, well, I remember that was the distribution at the time.

143
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
I mean, I was like really important for MTV to get on basic cable.

144
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Remember that?

145
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
It was.

146
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Because it was.

147
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,040
A lot of cable companies said, now we're going to push you up into the premium packages.

148
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,040
And I think it was for that very reason that MTV was so censored really.

149
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,040
I mean, how careful did we have to be with anything?

150
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,040
You couldn't offend anyone in the music industry,

151
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,040
and he sponsored and certainly got someone in BF.

152
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Because then we might get thrown off of this.

153
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
They did work.

154
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Very hard.

155
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,040
And employed a whole bunch of people to ensure that MTV offended no one.

156
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Affiliate relations was always.

157
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Wasn't that it?

158
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Who were always calling down?

159
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Yeah, but there was also that the head censor Michelle von Thos.

160
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Oh, there's a forgotten about her.

161
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Yeah.

162
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
The hammer.

163
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
She would go through the lyrics, right?

164
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
The lyrics of every single lyrics.

165
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
The videos.

166
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
She basically had the final say as to what the hammer.

167
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Is that what she was called the hammer?

168
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Michelle von Thos.

169
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
The hammer.

170
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,040
She's living out here at this point in the lovely Pacific Northwest.

171
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Is she no longer with MTV networks?

172
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Oh, no.

173
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
No.

174
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
She's not.

175
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
She probably had a breakdown from that crap.

176
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
I withhold all come in.

177
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Oh, really?

178
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Wait a minute.

179
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
I don't know.

180
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
I don't know.

181
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
I really don't know.

182
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Oh, I know.

183
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,040
I've got to rest a May one time at an advertising agency from someone named Michelle

184
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
von Thos who had just relocated from New York.

185
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,040
And obviously, she was no longer with the channel.

186
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,040
She's no longer with the channel.

187
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Tom Fresher.

188
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
No, there is Tom Fresher right.

189
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Yeah.

190
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,040
So that was another reason for us to get on the honkers because well,

191
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,040
we have lots of stories that we've actually withheld about Tom Fresher in the past.

192
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
And of course,

193
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm not going to hold back any more now.

194
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,960
Well, we'll talk about that in a second.

195
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,560
I know the one you're thinking about.

196
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Yeah.

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
We'll see if we get there.

198
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
That's not a funny light story.

199
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,560
And that's pretty heavy.

200
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,560
No, it's not a light story.

201
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,840
But I do have a funny time-pressed-in story.

202
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,040
All right, hit me with the Tom Freston story first.

203
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,880
Well, it's just, we were all, you know, let's just, let's just position this for a second

204
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,840
because people may not even know what the hell is going on.

205
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:18,520
Tom Freston was CEO of MTV Networks, which was MTV VH1 and Nickelodeon, from trying

206
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,000
to think, wasn't John Reardon there before him?

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll say there was the President of MTV and then he became the right, that's right.

209
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now, he's the right.

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The network.

211
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right, right.

212
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,840
I don't remember where Reardon fell in there, but Reardon was a big mockery muck in the

213
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
day as well.

214
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
I don't know what happened.

215
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,960
It's, um, and then my graph was graph.

216
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
A graph.

217
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah.

218
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,560
So every time Freston moved up, my graph would be right.

219
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,020
Now, Freston went to become a more respect for Judy McGrath than I did for Tom

220
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
Freston.

221
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
Well, exactly.

222
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,480
So my point was going to be after a whole bunch of rap and with you as the Tom Freston,

223
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,720
I was never impressed by him.

224
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I never thought he did anything intelligent for the channel.

225
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
I thought he was just an accountant that sat up there and just like, you know, smoked

226
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
dope with people.

227
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,880
Didn't actually seem like he contributed to anything within the channel.

228
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,240
Do you ever see him in any meeting of any significance ever, um, no, go ahead.

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,280
On the rare occasion that I did, though he never knew who I was.

230
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,080
I was with the channel for 10 years.

231
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
That's right.

232
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Who's that guy?

233
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,960
I know it was worse than that.

234
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,720
And I was a director of honor director of honor talented at that point.

235
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,400
And he would, why, we, we all, everybody just verified this to it.

236
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,160
The MTV alumni reunion in New York that I had.

237
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,560
And she's going to tell us about, yeah, we got, there's nothing scandalous, but yeah,

238
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,920
I'll tell you about it.

239
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,200
We just all got hammered.

240
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Uh-huh.

241
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,680
And everybody was laughing because they remembered, Freston would walk into a room and he, he would

242
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,280
say, well, hi, Adam, how are you?

243
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,880
Hi, Bob, hi, hi, Dave.

244
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Hi, nice to see you.

245
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Hi.

246
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,480
And he'd look at me and he'd say, and who the hell are you?

247
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,120
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

248
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Every time.

249
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,720
And that, and they'd say, well, this is Ken Clark.

250
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,480
He's the director of honor talent.

251
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Oh, yeah, right.

252
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
He's a hundred grand a year, Mr. Freston.

253
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Surely you know that.

254
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I know.

255
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,120
He's just a human flash-wasting money.

256
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,520
So then, you know, two weeks later, I bill hi, Dave, who said hello to you.

257
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,360
I mean, and that went on for 10 years.

258
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,920
Well, so anyway, so I remember how it went.

259
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,960
I think Freston moved up as Frank Beyondy moved up to corporate.

260
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
And I forgot about.

261
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Yeah.

262
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Oh, you know, I, I met his daughter the other day, beyondy's, beyondy's daughter is working

263
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
at zero.

264
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,680
Barbie, barbie, barbie, barbie, beyondy.

265
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,320
She doesn't show now with Martha Stewart's daughter.

266
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,920
It's pretty funny.

267
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,200
Anyway, so he moved up and then, and the graph, oh, no, then they brought in Reardon.

268
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,440
I remember it was really weird because John Reardon, no, wait a minute.

269
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm sorry.

270
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
We had Lee Masters.

271
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,960
Oh, I like Lee Masters was the shit.

272
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,200
He's the guy that hired me.

273
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,000
He hired me.

274
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He was MTV Networks president.

275
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's how it worked.

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He was in writing network.

277
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
MTV president.

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,040
Freston went to MTV Networks, then Reardon came in, and when Reardon came in, Lee went

279
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
out.

280
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,320
He started E Entertainment, which was the movie channel, what was it, what was it called?

281
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
What was it called?

282
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,280
It was called, it was called something else.

283
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Are you sure?

284
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Yeah.

285
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,440
It was like a movie kind of a gossipy.

286
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
No, it was some kind of movie channel.

287
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
It was dumb.

288
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Yes.

289
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,800
Yes, naturally V. I'm such a fan of Lee and snatched TV.

290
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
But then Reardon was living in Tom Freston's house.

291
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,880
You remember that?

292
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,280
And then Tom Freston fired up much, obviously, he had access to a much higher level

293
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
of executive.

294
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,920
It was really weird because he was in Freston's house and then Freston fired him and

295
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,280
never to be heard from again.

296
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,760
Where was Freston, why weren't Freston in Freston's wife in Freston's house?

297
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,320
They were, they were living with the Frestons.

298
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,800
It was really weird.

299
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
It really was.

300
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,840
And he didn't, Reardon didn't last for like half a year.

301
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,440
Well, did the guy move out immediately?

302
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
I think so.

303
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Yeah.

304
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,840
It was like a really weird situation.

305
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I don't know.

306
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Maybe he was known to come with Freston's wife.

307
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Didn't they split up?

308
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,080
You got a divorce, didn't he?

309
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
Freston?

310
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
No, I didn't have.

311
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,400
Yeah, I think so.

312
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,720
So anyway, so Tom Freston just last week was very publicly fired.

313
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
By the way, what?

314
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,160
He claimed he resigned.

315
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,560
No, come on, please.

316
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,960
Can't, I mean, it's in the business press.

317
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,160
Everyone's saying he was fired and the reasons were.

318
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,160
So I'm going to redstone, who owns a Viacom.

319
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,120
Viacom.

320
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Viacom.

321
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,000
It was like 83 and humble, this guy was unbelievable.

322
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,960
You don't fuck you, don't fuck you, don't fuck you, don't fuck.

323
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Tom, Tom, Tom, no shit.

324
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,600
So Freston apparently had missed out on the MySpace acquisition, which is what Fox

325
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,600
got.

326
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Rupert Murdoch, of course, arch enemy of Sumner Redstone and say, excuse me, overall

327
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
ratings.

328
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,960
No, the overall strategy was unclear and you know, they haven't really gotten anything

329
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
together.

330
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,920
So that really felt, and I agree, it did kind of feel like MTV's lagging around.

331
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,120
And then the most recent video musical words ratings were down 30 percent.

332
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,920
I think that was like, you know, the straw that broke the camel's back.

333
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,560
Oh, I had that on my list.

334
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Did you watch it?

335
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,840
Oh, you know, I sat here with Christina.

336
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
I didn't.

337
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
So I can't.

338
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Oh, well, Christina's 16, she's perfect MTV age, she sits down and she loves all kinds

339
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
of music.

340
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,760
But after 15 minutes, she says, I can't stand it, it's just too much hip hop.

341
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
It's too much fucking hip.

342
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,400
I don't mind a little bit of hip hop, but it's all hip hop.

343
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,680
She could, she literally walked away.

344
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,320
I actually, I had to t-boat it and I too find myself fast forwarding through at least

345
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
three acts.

346
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm just like, okay.

347
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,800
It's just too much.

348
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,840
I saw like a wrap up on, you know, entertainment tonight or something.

349
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,400
And I realized that I really, really am now completely out of touch.

350
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,680
We're old, officially.

351
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,680
I thought I knew what was going on.

352
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,720
No, but I know, but I obviously not.

353
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,600
And Jack Black was just horrible.

354
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
And I think he's a very funny guy.

355
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,400
Great actor.

356
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
I can't really like him.

357
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,400
Yeah.

358
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,560
This was definitely no.

359
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,480
Oh, it was, it was just not happening.

360
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,880
It was like everything was supposed to go wrong.

361
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,360
And it wasn't funny the way they were, it's just wasn't funny.

362
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,680
It wasn't funny.

363
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,160
So anyway, so Tom Fresen's out.

364
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,720
So that means that MTV is in flux.

365
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,800
And who is this guy?

366
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,200
They brought back this, with a D.

367
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,400
Daughter, what's his name?

368
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,440
I think he was name.

369
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,160
Yeah, it was a guy who'd done something before.

370
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Anyway, what I'm looking for that,

371
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,960
what a lot of people commented on on this year's video

372
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,360
musical awards, particularly the pre-game show,

373
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,560
is John Norris and Kurt Loder.

374
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,400
I still alive.

375
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,760
I actually, several people either called or emailed me

376
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,440
about John Norris's hair color, about John Norris

377
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,040
in general.

378
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,640
I just think, you know, I feel really bad saying that

379
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,960
because I got along with John, you know,

380
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,560
but that was, I never did.

381
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,120
I never got along with him and he hated me.

382
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,680
I did okay with John, I really did.

383
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,400
I have nothing personal against him.

384
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,840
It's just that that was like 15 years ago.

385
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,880
And we've all grown up and I turn the thing on

386
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,520
and he's still sitting there.

387
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,200
Like Frankenstein talking to these people

388
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,280
and there is something hermetically preserved

389
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,360
looking about him.

390
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,840
I just, for Maldahide does wonders.

391
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,440
I question how stimulating that job can still be.

392
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,440
He always wanted to be, you know,

393
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,480
this is where exactly where you wanted to be.

394
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,080
And, you know, the MTV News Department,

395
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,760
bless him because they did,

396
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,400
I have to say, transform the channel

397
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,320
with a lot of their long-form programming

398
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
and a lot of it really, really top-notch stuff.

399
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,960
And they totally drove that and Dave Ceronek certainly.

400
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,440
And he was great.

401
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,400
And I heard Kurt was very important to the channel

402
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,240
because he was a really credible,

403
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,080
he was a journalist at the time he joined the channel.

404
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,360
The problem is whenever he goes to interview someone,

405
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,240
he has the personality of a fucking dish rag.

406
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Well, that's true.

407
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,400
I mean, he just, that's the downside.

408
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,280
He's a great writer, great journalist,

409
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,680
but I never thought he was a huge TV personality.

410
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
No, he's very, and I'm quite certain

411
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,480
that he would probably agree.

412
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,760
He's very, very, very.

413
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,480
Certainly after 10 Martinez.

414
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,360
I really, he could knock him down my boy, Kurt.

415
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,640
He could slow him down like, you know,

416
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,120
he'd been pushed out there and he would endure it.

417
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,600
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.

418
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,120
He would endure them in a long, you know,

419
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,480
MTV news snippet, but as soon as it was over,

420
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,200
I was like, for Christ, they'd give me a cigarette.

421
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,240
You know, the cigarette was always right out of the...

422
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,080
Like mine.

423
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,280
Mine was always under the table too.

424
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,960
I know, which we're always smoking.

425
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,480
We were always smoking in the studio.

426
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,120
Part of the fun thing about going back to New York

427
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,160
that week of the MTV reunion.

428
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

429
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,520
And seeing a lot of people, some of which I,

430
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,280
some of whom were gone well before you even got there.

431
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,440
I saw the lady that first picked up the phone

432
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
when I was a college kid in Ohio,

433
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,000
and I kept calling MTV trying to get somebody on the phone,

434
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,600
they gave me the time of day.

435
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,040
In this lady named Claire Joseph picked up the phone

436
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,600
and finally, and talked to me,

437
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,040
and helped me get in touch with Brian Godchew.

438
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Was Brian there?

439
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,720
Was Brian Godchew?

440
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,560
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Excellent.

442
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,280
As was Claire Joseph, and she left before,

443
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,360
you know, I guess she went to VH one or something,

444
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,520
but I had not seen Claire Joseph in like 20 years.

445
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
And so like I, I just went right over to her,

446
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,800
and I said, Claire, you know, how the fuck are you?

447
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,160
You may not remember me, but, and I like,

448
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,480
like, I don't know, like, almost made her cry.

449
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,560
Really?

450
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,600
I mean, in a good way,

451
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,640
because I said really, if you hadn't taken the time

452
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,560
to be a nice lady, I hadn't know what they all would have happened.

453
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,800
I like, I would end it up like all my other friends

454
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,600
school, you know, like working in a gas station in Toledo

455
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,960
with a deeper capital L loser.

456
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,880
All right, so, so, so, so, so, so, first of all,

457
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,240
it was Philip Domin, that name doesn't ring a bell

458
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,160
and Thomas dolly, that, that does ring a bell.

459
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,400
Dolly rings a very distant bell, hang down.

460
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,360
Yeah, time, dolly, it does.

461
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,240
And that said, well, was he, was that a song?

462
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,080
Was he?

463
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Oh, the, the new team, down, yeah, Domin and Dolly

464
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,120
is the same one that led Viacom from 96 to 2000

465
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,960
after Redstone and fired an earlier,

466
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,360
oh, after he had fired an earlier CEO, Frank beyondy.

467
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
There you go.

468
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,200
There he is.

469
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,720
So, when beyondy went out,

470
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,480
fresh then moved up, and those guys moved into,

471
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,600
into Viacom, into running Viacom.

472
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,160
They sound like an afternoon showed.

473
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,560
Everybody, it's Domin and Dolly,

474
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,840
we're the, yeah, here, we're on the MTV

475
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,040
and she's not always everybody, yeah,

476
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,800
we got some really good, interactive stuff,

477
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,480
we're your social networking stuff.

478
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,520
All right, so who was there?

479
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,760
Who was at the, at the 25th reunion?

480
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,800
And by the way, it would have been nice to have been invited.

481
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,760
It was this only, this is a five year thing, too.

482
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,560
Well, no, actually, that was probably open to everybody.

483
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,800
T, and I, I see, I see.

484
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,400
Take more blame than anybody else,

485
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,680
but it was, it was kind of assembled

486
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,360
by really, really early people.

487
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,320
I was in America, I was in San Francisco,

488
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
but I would have come to New York.

489
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,440
Well, they, they didn't, there was an LA

490
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,800
that you could have gone down to LA

491
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,200
and joined Martha Quinn and Nina Blackwood.

492
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,640
Okay, well, I'm glad you didn't tell me that.

493
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,640
And Ken's size, Lure.

494
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,560
Ken's size, well, there was, there was a simultaneous gig

495
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,040
held on both coasts.

496
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,200
Oh, was it a satellite link up?

497
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Well, they tried, but nobody could make anything go, I don't think.

498
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,240
It was, there was a video cast done of it

499
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,320
and it was, it is available online somewhere.

500
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,560
Excellent.

501
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,000
All right, so who was in New York?

502
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,440
Who did you, who did you see?

503
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,200
You know, there was a huge list of people

504
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,240
that wouldn't mean anything to anybody.

505
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,440
Right, skip them.

506
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,600
The, was Julian Goldberg, still at MTV,

507
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,720
when you were there?

508
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,960
Jillian Goldberg?

509
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,760
Jillian.

510
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,960
Jillian?

511
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Yeah.

512
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,080
He was a tall bald guy who was very instrumental

513
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,600
in the early MTV days.

514
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,240
There had been like Ken's size, Lure,

515
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
and Jillian Goldberg.

516
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,600
Were these in the honor promo department, guys?

517
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,960
No, they were probably heads of production.

518
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
I don't think so.

519
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,760
I don't know.

520
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,520
Size little rings are gone, but Jillian Goldberg

521
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,400
was the original executive producer of MTV.

522
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,040
Well, I, one of the things I found for the reunion party,

523
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,880
I, you know, because I have the vaults of stuff,

524
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,480
is I put together these little packets

525
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,480
and had them all copied and bound to pass out to people.

526
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,680
Oh, that's nice.

527
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,920
Funny things like, you know, the Michael Jackson Memo,

528
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,440
the infamous Hammer Memo, and I had the original

529
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,440
five press releases from MTV, a subsidiary of Warner Amix.

530
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Oh, that's right.

531
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,720
That's right.

532
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,480
And now I'm seeing the hiring of Mark Allen, J.J. Nina.

533
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,320
Oh, that's cool.

534
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,440
And so, Jillian was there.

535
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,120
Did you hand out any of the, any of the blooper

536
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,840
really have?

537
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,160
No, I didn't take any video.

538
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Dude, we've got to put that online.

539
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,120
We've got to put that online.

540
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,720
Oh, you know, I had a great conversation with,

541
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,320
I ended up having a couple of gin and tonics at the bar

542
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,640
with Rick Krim.

543
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,080
Oh, I like Rick Krim, who's all right.

544
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,760
I always liked Rick Krim, the minute I saw him,

545
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,760
I was like, Rick, dude, Rick is a VP at VH1.

546
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,160
I think, still in talent, artist relations.

547
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,440
So he's with the network, no longer with the channel.

548
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,160
And I kind of like VH1, you know, VH1 sometimes.

549
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,680
Well, VH1, no, plays Metallica.

550
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,880
So, I ended up talking to Rick for a long time,

551
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
but we were talking about the fact that I've got a lot

552
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,760
of really cool shit on tape and that, you know, over time,

553
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,400
it's degrading and rotting.

554
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Yeah, it is.

555
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,280
And that someday, all this shit needs to be burned to DVD.

556
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,080
I mean, there's a, there's a vault of it.

557
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,360
A truckload, a veritable truckload.

558
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,960
Can, can, listen to me.

559
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,520
I will have it all pay for it to be professionally transferred

560
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,920
every single last tape.

561
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,400
How much the idea have like, that's really worth saving?

562
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,560
Well, I'd have just, I've got about 15 boxes of great quarter-inch

563
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,240
reals.

564
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,720
I'm going to, you know, you need to, you mad, you mad,

565
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,200
you mad, you mad, you mad, you mad machine to spot them.

566
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,240
Well, yeah, but a lot of them are labeled in stuff.

567
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,520
I mean, the looper, the looper, yeah, much that.

568
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,920
Let's just get the blooper real.

569
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,080
Let's just transfer that.

570
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,920
Let's put it out.

571
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,640
There's a few blooper reals, but yeah, I could probably, you know,

572
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,000
siphon off the looper.

573
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,760
I'll find a place in Portland that'll do it.

574
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
And you just bring the tapes there.

575
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
And then they'll do it professionally.

576
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,320
And then we'll put them up online.

577
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,200
I'll take the risk.

578
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Don't worry about it.

579
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,440
Well, have your people, call my people this week.

580
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,160
Oh, I should have started that.

581
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,640
Shell.

582
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
That'll be so cool.

583
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,560
There's some awesome stuff there.

584
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,800
I mean, the best stuff, really.

585
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,200
So actually, the week of the, the week of the MTV thing,

586
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,360
MTV did everything they possibly could

587
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,640
to thwart any press.

588
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,720
Yeah, they didn't want to see mold, right?

589
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,960
Well, yeah, that was the story.

590
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,080
Was it they wanted to see meong in fresh and relevant

591
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,840
and dwelling on the fact that they were a quarter of a century

592
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,480
old made them feel old.

593
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,920
And I, I think that's probably horseshit.

594
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,200
They received such, you know, unanimous bad response

595
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,320
to their celebration of their 20th, which

596
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,240
was the biggest piece of shit that's ever come down by.

597
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,280
That they were probably afraid to go anywhere near the 25th.

598
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,360
Freshness, but was puckering.

599
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,920
Well, they, they refused to release any, any old video

600
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,080
or footage of MTV, any press or media outlet.

601
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,120
I heard through the grapevine that even Kurt Loder was told

602
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,240
that he was absolutely forbidden from doing any press regarding

603
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,400
the typical, that's so typical.

604
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
That's so typical.

605
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,920
MTV, Martha and Nina and everybody were told that, you know,

606
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,280
they weren't allowed to use any photos or any footage of them

607
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,800
to any media outlet from the MTV era.

608
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Really?

609
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,800
No, another infamous MTV memo, like if they were,

610
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,320
well, I don't have access to any of this.

611
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,160
This is here, say, a new hobby, knowing the network,

612
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,400
as well as it sounds like it.

613
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,840
I'm pretty certain that, you know, the powers that

614
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,560
be decided that they really didn't want to celebrate the 25th anniversary.

615
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,240
However, you know, the founding staff, including some really high

616
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,600
ups, it, freshness was actually there at one of the two parties.

617
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,600
So, I mean, you know, in New York, in New York, yeah.

618
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I heard that when he left, the one I didn't go to.

619
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,800
When he left the building, everyone crowded the hallways and the plot

620
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,720
of it as he left.

621
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,720
A plot of that he was leaving or a plot of him, applauding him, I believe.

622
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Oh, okay.

623
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,760
I didn't know what you were, you meant.

624
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,720
I would have been like, goodbye!

625
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, he would have looked at me and said,

626
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
who the hell are you?

627
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Thanks, thanks Bob, thanks Adam, whoever you are, thanks.

628
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,480
Great work and we're the, I really love your work.

629
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960
No, I'm sure he did.

630
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
So, no, it's kind of odd.

631
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
No celebs showed up.

632
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,160
Big celebrities, no, because it wasn't that kind of party.

633
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,240
You know, MTV, like VJ-wise in New York, we had Alan Hunter and Mark Goodman.

634
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,600
We're both in New York.

635
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
What are they doing now?

636
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:03,760
So, I know that they're, all the original VJs are on serious, yes, that I'm aware of.

637
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,080
Are you a revival channel?

638
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:14,440
Mark was doing terrestrial radio in Los Angeles, and of course, he pointed that out.

639
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,680
I'm also doing a terrestrial radio.

640
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,000
No, actually, he didn't.

641
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
Mark Mark was very cool.

642
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:28,240
I have no idea what he's doing now because he recently relocated to back to the New York area.

643
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,560
Oh, really?

644
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:35,680
Yes, he's living in, he's living in the suburbs of New Jersey in a place that you know,

645
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,720
not real well, it's, it's not, we're living lived.

646
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,200
It's not Montclair or Verona, we're lived.

647
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Where is it?

648
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,440
It's a place where a lot of your money went.

649
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,840
A lot of my money at Lannick City?

650
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,840
No, no, yeah, like you have a pressure used to know gambling.

651
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,680
Come on, honey, it's only three hour drive.

652
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Come on, let's go.

653
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Whenever, yeah, whenever all man, whenever all man, all power would fly over you guys

654
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,960
would hit at Lannick City.

655
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,120
A lot of my money went.

656
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,560
Where the hell did my money go?

657
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,760
That's a good question, Ken.

658
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Where did it go?

659
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Short, short hills.

660
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Oh, short, short hill.

661
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,640
Of course, short hills, mall.

662
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,200
I wasn't the short hills, mall.

663
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,040
It was the mall at short hill.

664
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,240
The mall, I'm sorry, yes, the mall at short hills.

665
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,200
Yeah, a lot of money did go that way, didn't it?

666
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, I said, where are you living now, Mark?

667
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,760
And he said, out in short hills, I was like, in short hills,

668
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
only shit.

669
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,680
Yeah, that's expensive there.

670
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,840
Well, I would presume most places in short hills, pretty upscale.

671
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,200
I would think he's worth it.

672
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,560
No, I don't know, I don't use it anywhere in New Jersey

673
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,120
is probably expensive.

674
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,840
Yeah, that's true.

675
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
OK, so here we go.

676
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,120
And Alan, Alan Hunter, still does house, right?

677
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,240
Is still in Alabama, had his lovely girlfriend with him

678
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,280
and his daughter who is his daughter and goodman's daughter,

679
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,720
both our teenagers now, and we're like knockouts.

680
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,320
It's kind of alarming that everybody's daughters

681
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,520
and the talk to be these gorgeous young women,

682
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,040
everybody in the restaurant was, you know,

683
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,840
ogling at them, nobody had any idea.

684
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,520
They were underage.

685
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,200
They look at me in the 20s.

686
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,080
I'm sure you know how that goes.

687
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,560
Oh, Christina showed me her fake ID yesterday.

688
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,280
Oh, great.

689
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,320
She's like, you're like, yeah, look at this.

690
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,880
Oh, you said you're 19 here.

691
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, it works.

692
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,560
She says in her nice little British accent, it works.

693
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,120
That's funny.

694
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
She's nuts.

695
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,840
So the week I was in New York, though,

696
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,480
it was like 100 degrees, and there was like 98% humidity

697
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,560
and like 31 people died from the heat.

698
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,360
OK, so do you remember how bad

699
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,520
New York used to get when I remember spending

700
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,160
one summer in New York and vowing to myself never, ever again.

701
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,800
Yeah, and then you bought the house out in New York.

702
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,320
That's right.

703
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,840
That's right.

704
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,240
With the pool.

705
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,000
This is no way to live.

706
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,360
Yeah.

707
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Allen, anyway, no.

708
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,280
Allen Hunter is still down in Birmingham, Alabama.

709
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,200
He's still doing his video production stuff.

710
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,680
Has a film production company actually has his

711
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,360
film artist, you know, a lot of independent films

712
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,200
is involved with Sundance this year.

713
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,600
And also owns a big facility that's recording studios

714
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,080
and a club and whatnot, really, Birmingham.

715
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,760
So yeah.

716
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,960
Right on.

717
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,760
I didn't know about it.

718
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,600
Yeah, and he's holding the studio on the ground.

719
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,240
Yeah, that's cool.

720
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,920
Sounds like it.

721
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,600
That's great.

722
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,640
No downtown Julie Brown, I presume.

723
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,560
No downtown Julie Brown.

724
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,200
That was it in terms of VJs.

725
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,880
And then there were just a lot of cool people like Brian

726
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,720
and Helene Gross, who I have been seen in towns.

727
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,120
And I, you know, like I said, I had a great conversation

728
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,120
with Rick Kram and, and, you know, I'm trying to think

729
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,520
if there's anybody else who'd have been particularly interested

730
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,680
in.

731
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,720
No, not really.

732
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Not at the party.

733
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,080
I had a wild weekend Manhattan.

734
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,360
Now did everybody sit around and mope about how

735
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,560
in TV doesn't play videos anymore?

736
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,160
Oh, no, no, no, no.

737
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,440
This was a group of people who really, really enjoyed working

738
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,120
together, getting together, many of whom

739
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,880
hadn't seen each other in 10, 15 years.

740
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,520
Nobody was, what MTV was doing now was pretty much

741
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,280
irrelevant conversation.

742
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,880
It was, it was how are you?

743
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
What are you doing now?

744
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,200
You know, it was a lot of, do you remember this and that?

745
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,840
I mean, seeing each other and, you know, triggered all sorts

746
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,120
of funny memories of shit that happened back then.

747
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,360
OK, so I'll forgotten.

748
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,640
Give me a story that they recalled that was good, can?

749
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,920
Well, I had found a couple of memos that I had

750
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,680
or letters that I had, that MTV memos brought a few laughs.

751
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,400
Yeah, things that were in the vault.

752
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,880
I found a great, before you remember Communicar, right?

753
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
Our boy of it, car service.

754
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,520
Let me just, yeah, let me just explain Communicar in New York.

755
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,360
It was really one of the first mass scale radio cars.

756
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,760
So it's like, it's like a cab that you can call no difference.

757
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,920
Except the cars wall, this ugly burgundy, kind of,

758
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,680
they were burgundy, burgundy town cars and you had vouchers.

759
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,480
And so, you know, the car would cost, you know, whatever car costs.

760
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,720
I mean, if you left it for now, it cost 25 bucks or something like that.

761
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,400
We didn't ever find out really directly what it costs.

762
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,800
It was all went to corporate.

763
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,280
The corporate would give me vouchers vouchers vouchers.

764
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,200
Yeah, that was like gold boy.

765
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Can sky would give each VJ, you know, two vouchers per recording session

766
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,080
want to get two one to get from.

767
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,360
That was the big limit.

768
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
That was early.

769
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,240
That was the big limit that we were all riding in was fucking Communicar.

770
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,680
And the limits were only for when people would see you like, you know, bullshit can.

771
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,520
They never never gave us limos.

772
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
I always got my own limos.

773
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Yeah, no.

774
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,640
Who got the limo the night you were in that limo with downtown Julie Brown and it backed over

775
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
the old lady.

776
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
That was my limo.

777
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
That was my limo.

778
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
That was my limo.

779
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,120
I paid for that limo when we back over her.

780
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,440
It was downtown Julie Brown doing in there.

781
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't remember.

782
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,920
I really don't remember.

783
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
I do.

784
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
I don't remember her being in the limo.

785
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,360
I don't remember backing up over the old one of the old ladies.

786
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
That was pretty funny.

787
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Yeah, oops.

788
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Sorry, lady.

789
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,000
I think that was for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame awards or something like that.

790
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I think that's what we're going to do.

791
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,520
I just have another funny story, too, that came up.

792
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,800
Before that, the Communicar story, before there was Communicar, they had a different

793
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
car service.

794
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,480
And this was before my day at the channel, frankly, I think I started right around the

795
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,360
time they went with Communicar.

796
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,760
And they're probably still with Communicar, frankly, I don't know, but Mark Goodman

797
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,840
was getting picked up at his house one morning to go to the studio for his taping.

798
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,400
And they got like partway there and he realized, like, having forbid, he didn't have

799
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,080
a voucher.

800
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,520
And so you got voucher, well, you got voucher, you got voucher, you got voucher, exactly.

801
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:57,080
This solution Mark proposed was drive me to the studio, I'll go in and get one, you

802
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
know?

803
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
I mean, I'm comfortable.

804
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Yeah.

805
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:08,480
He's like, no, the guy's insisting, he's going to take him home immediately.

806
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,840
Didn't they call JJ Jackson the franchise, he's not what they call them at Communicar?

807
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Yeah, probably.

808
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Just JJ.

809
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,480
And Dr. Dre had a lover also.

810
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Those guys left the car out all the time, it's like just for 10 hours.

811
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
And he's in front of the club.

812
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
10, 12 hours.

813
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
It's like he was sitting there.

814
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
All right.

815
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,440
So, Judy McGrath and everybody would have a stroke, sitting up and out for like a $400

816
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Communicar bill.

817
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,480
So, this argument ensues in the town car and it finally got to the point that escalated

818
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,080
the car driver, brandishing a screwdriver and trying to like poke Mark Goodman over the

819
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
seat.

820
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Excellent.

821
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,200
And like Mark finally dove out of the moving car and like was almost killed in

822
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
traffic.

823
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,760
All right.

824
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,240
And he had written this really, really funny memo to like the president or the vice president

825
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,280
of MTV and also copying the head of the car service about that whole, and you have

826
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
that memo sitting.

827
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
I do.

828
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,280
And it was a very, very funny memo.

829
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Oh, you're going to read it.

830
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
You're going to have to share it.

831
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Oh, it's very, very lengthy.

832
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Oh, okay.

833
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
I don't want to read that.

834
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,680
It's, it's three pages of, of recanting this story.

835
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,160
I mean, I guess the important part is that he,

836
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,960
tried to stab him with a screwdriver and I believe it was the next week that they switched

837
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
to community.

838
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,360
That was the end of that.

839
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,880
But it did remind me and this, I wasn't so much an MTV story as an Adam Curry story.

840
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,600
Oh, boy.

841
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,880
There was a time after I had left the channel and was working for me, right?

842
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Yes.

843
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,680
That you were in Los Angeles doing something.

844
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:54,920
It was something, perhaps it was this, I think it was the circus of the circus.

845
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Oh, dude.

846
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,720
Circus of the stars were the rocket car of death with, what was her name?

847
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
What was the host of the show?

848
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Oh, fuck.

849
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,920
Dear, dear, dear hall was not known.

850
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
Was that her name?

851
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Dear, dear.

852
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Dear, dear hall.

853
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
What's her name?

854
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Come on.

855
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
That was dear, dear hall.

856
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
It was dear, dear hall, right?

857
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
I don't.

858
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,280
I remember Cameron Diaz.

859
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,560
Cameron Diaz was on that show with me and she was doing a trap.

860
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,040
He's number.

861
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,640
And she was 13.

862
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,640
She was a little fat Puggie kid through 13.

863
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,640
And anyway, I should have gotten her then, and nailed her.

864
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,280
You had to, you had to nip up to San Francisco for some sort of radio station promo.

865
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,520
Really?

866
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,740
And you were supposed to take just like a shuttle flight up to San Francisco and do this

867
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,600
radio station gig.

868
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,760
And then fly back down to LA for the next day's taping of circus of the circus of

869
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
the stars.

870
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,120
No, it could not be circus of the stars in LA because I was really sick then.

871
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
I remember.

872
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:01,240
Well, it's when you abandon your car, you abandon your car.

873
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,640
I remember this.

874
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Wait a minute.

875
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Wait a minute.

876
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
Let me back up.

877
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,040
Budget rent a car in Los Angeles.

878
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,720
I don't know if they still do it.

879
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,040
They had this great service.

880
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,720
And we were always allowed to rent a car through budget.

881
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,040
Now I always paid extra money for the car that I think didn't I can?

882
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,760
Did I always put on extra cash?

883
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,800
Yeah, like a Mercedes 500 SL or something nice convertible.

884
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Oh, Lexus.

885
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Yeah.

886
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Nice cars.

887
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Nice car.

888
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,520
And what was cool about the service is you'd arrive at LAX and the guy would be waiting

889
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,720
for you at baggage claim and you'd walk over to the car, which you'd already driven

890
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
there.

891
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
You know, he'd take your luggage.

892
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,440
It was like, you've got really good.

893
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,760
It's like, you know, okay, I'm on the lowest wrong of the show business ladder here.

894
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,200
But I got a guy picking me up.

895
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I got some hot wheels.

896
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,560
You know, I got a nice, nice ride here waiting for me.

897
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,720
And sometimes when you take the guy back and drop them off, because I always stayed at

898
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,120
the water stay, same James Club hotel.

899
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,960
The same James.

900
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,280
Yeah, fuck, I forgot about that.

901
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Yeah.

902
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,760
And so, yeah, so I don't think it was a trip to San Francisco, but I do remember at one

903
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
point.

904
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,520
I think it was a, maybe it was a BMW I'm thinking, because I always tried to rent

905
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,760
a different car each time.

906
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,000
So I wanted to drive cool cars.

907
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,960
I think it was a BMW that had everything integrated.

908
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:33,000
Whatever it was, I basically drove up to departures at LAX and I was late for the flight.

909
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,520
I just, this is not how you were supposed to do this.

910
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
I should point out.

911
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,000
No, you're supposed to, how did it?

912
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,800
It was a valet return lot, like a block or two from the airport.

913
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Right.

914
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,440
You're supposed to go to the valet return.

915
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Yeah.

916
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
And then take the fucking bus.

917
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,440
I had no time for that, can.

918
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,040
So I drive the beamer up.

919
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
I get my stuff.

920
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
I jump out.

921
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,040
I lock the car and I get on my flight and I call a can from the plane and say, what

922
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,120
I say, hey, Ken, I don't think you locked the car.

923
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
I think you left the keys in.

924
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,120
Well, if the key in the car, that's right with the doors open.

925
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,520
Hey, Ken.

926
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,960
I wasn't even sure if it was in the curb lane to be honest, you were in a triopic jam.

927
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
I just got out and took away.

928
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,040
I think you just got out and then called me from the airport and as you were running

929
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,040
to the gate and said that you had just bailed the car.

930
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,320
And so then I had to get on the phone with budget or whoever the hell it was.

931
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
There was budget.

932
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,720
Before a budget, it was luxury line.

933
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
You remember the luxury line?

934
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Luxury line.

935
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Luxury line.

936
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Beverly Hills.

937
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Yeah.

938
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,480
So they, they were not, I had the call them and tell them.

939
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,680
I'll never forget the guy in the phone cracked me up because I had to tell them what

940
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,680
you'd done.

941
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,280
And I told them what you'd done and the guy says to me, bit serer, he can't do that.

942
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,480
You seem to misunderstand the point of my call.

943
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
It's been done.

944
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,480
And then when you came back, they didn't want you to have a car.

945
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
No, they didn't want to.

946
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
The car.

947
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
I wonder why.

948
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Gee.

949
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
That's kind of amazing.

950
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
I don't know why we got talking about that.

951
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,480
We did a lot of cool shit and Los Angeles back in the day man.

952
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,480
We went there all the time to do fun stuff.

953
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Yeah.

954
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
We really did.

955
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Everybody was always jetting off.

956
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,480
And I'm telling you, every time we went to LA, it was just a barcherous.

957
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Everyone was always messed up.

958
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Everybody behaved pretty well in New York.

959
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,480
I mean, we've said before while doing the MTV Chronicles,

960
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
that that place ran like a well-oiled machine.

961
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
And we had a lot of fun.

962
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
And we got along well.

963
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,480
But it wasn't the sort of sex drugs and rock and roll sort of hijinks that people might imagine.

964
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
No.

965
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
The minute you gave us those commune car vouchers, we were off.

966
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
You know.

967
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
Yeah.

968
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
We're loose now.

969
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,480
But for some reason, LA was always free rain to.

970
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Free rain to partay.

971
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,480
Yeah.

972
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
It was cool.

973
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Yeah.

974
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Everybody.

975
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
I used to do all the skiing stuff.

976
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
I went to all those ski resorts and we used to.

977
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
But that wasn't Colorado.

978
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
We'd like send you off to Aspen.

979
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Aspen Vale, Brecken Ridge, Whistler.

980
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
The special brewer.

981
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Yeah.

982
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,480
The special camera men that can ski backwards while holding that camera.

983
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
No.

984
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
We had a guy one time.

985
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
I think it was in Brecken Ridge.

986
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,480
And turnout he couldn't actually really ski.

987
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
It was really, really sad.

988
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
It was so sad.

989
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
He was strong.

990
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
He was strong.

991
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Like a million times.

992
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
His camera was completely messed up.

993
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Well, couldn't he just stand in a stationary location?

994
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Have you come flying past?

995
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Yeah.

996
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
We did a lot of that.

997
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
He was actually at the top of the mountain.

998
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
Afraid to go down.

999
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Yeah.

1000
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Made a little bit harder.

1001
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,480
He's like, I don't think I can go down.

1002
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,480
Any other stuff in the packet that you want to share with us?

1003
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
No off the top of my head.

1004
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I can't think of anything in the packet.

1005
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
The party I should have gone to.

1006
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
You know, there were two parties in New York.

1007
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
One the night of the first.

1008
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Because that was the actual anniversary of MTV.

1009
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
But that was Tuesday night.

1010
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
And I was actually flying in.

1011
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,480
I was I was landing at Newark at about the time.

1012
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
The party was going on.

1013
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,480
And I opted not to go straight to the party with my luggage.

1014
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
So miss that one.

1015
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,480
But at that party, we had my graph and fresh and.

1016
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
And you got to tell me about these things.

1017
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Can the entire upper.

1018
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
At.

1019
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
At whatever.

1020
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
It's a show.

1021
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Thank you.

1022
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Sorry.

1023
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
The upper echelon.

1024
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
It's still morning here in Portland, you know.

1025
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Yeah.

1026
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
And I'm not sure I can say that we're in any way.

1027
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
But they were all there.

1028
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
And I missed that one.

1029
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Yeah.

1030
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
Sounds like that was fun.

1031
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Well, would you please.

1032
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,480
When it's 50th, would you please send me an email?

1033
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
So we can.

1034
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
Well, I don't know how many people will be left.

1035
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,480
I mean, the one thing that I do notice is in.

1036
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Carloader John John Norris probably won't be.

1037
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
Most people look pretty good.

1038
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,480
But, you know, especially the early early folks, you know, I started there.

1039
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,480
When I was 21 or 22 years old, and they were already in their 30th or 40th.

1040
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
That's right.

1041
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
And so now they're really old.

1042
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Because that was like 20 years ago.

1043
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
And then.

1044
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
I don't know.

1045
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
It's actually not really funny.

1046
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
Well, we're getting old.

1047
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Everybody's doing well, though.

1048
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,480
I hear Beth McCarthy might be leaving Saturday night live.

1049
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
I don't know if that's true.

1050
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Really?

1051
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Well, how is.

1052
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
How's Saturday night live doing?

1053
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
I catch it once in a while when I'm in.

1054
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
You know, I haven't.

1055
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,480
I haven't watched network television at all in years.

1056
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,480
Although I did check out the the the debut of Katie Curric this week.

1057
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Oh, yeah.

1058
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,480
How was she?

1059
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,480
She was all right.

1060
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Yeah.

1061
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
She was all right.

1062
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
That's another something a redstone move right there.

1063
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,480
He personally made sure that they got her with the moon vest.

1064
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,480
Who is the golden child now?

1065
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
It didn't so much strike me as news.

1066
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,480
It's just like a half hour of of feature packages in some promotion.

1067
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Exactly.

1068
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Exactly.

1069
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
That's what people want.

1070
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
No, you don't know.

1071
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Yeah.

1072
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,480
That's what it's because I like the news.

1073
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
So while I was in New York.

1074
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
The big news.

1075
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
I was, you know, as a.

1076
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,480
It was so hot out during the day.

1077
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
It didn't even go out until after dark.

1078
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,480
You would just sit there in near hotel room and.

1079
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
Wack on wait for the sun to go down.

1080
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
In the air conditioning.

1081
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,480
So you spent a lot of time watching the television.

1082
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,480
It was one afternoon.

1083
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
It was all over the news.

1084
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Our old friend boy George.

1085
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
Oh, he had to clean the streets, right?

1086
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
That was while I was in New York.

1087
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,480
It was like to go down.

1088
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
No.

1089
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,480
I actually thought about going down in my camera.

1090
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,480
And I had a lovely dinner with our old friend.

1091
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
Jill Stemple who's actually very well.

1092
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Jill.

1093
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
The diva.

1094
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
Jill.

1095
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,480
The diva Stemple is the bureau chief of the.

1096
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,480
She opened in his heading the New York bureau of the world entertainment news.

1097
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Network.

1098
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Went.

1099
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,480
Went.

1100
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,480
The guys.

1101
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
The guys we used to buy our news from Lloyd Bany and.

1102
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Oh, he's still around.

1103
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
That's Jill's boss, man.

1104
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
That's pretty funny.

1105
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,480
And she's the bureau chief of the New York bureau.

1106
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
They're doing well.

1107
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
So she's laughingly.

1108
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
It said where you, you edit it.

1109
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,480
Why didn't she go down there with their camera and take some.

1110
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
Really?

1111
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Celebrity.

1112
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
I was like, because it was a hundred.

1113
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,480
Fucking degrees out.

1114
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
Then I didn't want to have a hate stroke.

1115
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Did I do like an in store appearance at a hardware store with boy George once?

1116
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,480
You did something funny with boy George in a store once.

1117
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,480
You guys knew each other.

1118
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
He's a really nice guy.

1119
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
He's a sweetheart when he's not a hero.

1120
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,480
He just keeps having trouble.

1121
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
Yeah.

1122
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
I met him a couple of times.

1123
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,480
The first time he was on heroin.

1124
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
And then remember that.

1125
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
I remember that.

1126
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Yeah.

1127
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
I wasn't there.

1128
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
But I remember you telling me about that.

1129
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Right.

1130
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
And that was in Holland.

1131
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,480
And they said, whatever you do, don't talk to him.

1132
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
I said, okay.

1133
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,480
And then I started went to announce him and I said, hey, don't talk to him.

1134
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,480
Why do you mean?

1135
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
Because he was on heroin.

1136
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
He was like completely fucked up.

1137
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,480
And he was just going to lip sync to the song on stage with all

1138
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
bunch of kids in front of it.

1139
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
And that was going to be it.

1140
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
And so I go up to announce him.

1141
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,480
And instead of doing, and here's boy George.

1142
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,480
I said, hey, man, they say you're on heroin.

1143
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
Oh, no.

1144
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,480
Did you believe?

1145
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
Yeah.

1146
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
He was really.

1147
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
He didn't know what was happened.

1148
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,480
But the woman from virgin was beside herself.

1149
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
But then, he didn't hear that did that.

1150
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Oh, yeah.

1151
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Oh, I heard it.

1152
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
Yeah.

1153
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Yeah.

1154
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
That's like one of those things.

1155
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,480
But then the later we met at the, it was like a, a mis, a hard

1156
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,480
Where's the mis Channel or something?

1157
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
I don't know.

1158
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
It was mis Home Depot.

1159
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,480
Somewhere in New Jersey.

1160
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,480
It was for Z100.

1161
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,480
And he was in the, he was in Georgia.

1162
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,480
I didn't remember that.

1163
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,480
Yeah.

1164
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,480
He was a photo of you guys.

1165
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,480
Yeah.

1166
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,480
The judging thing.

1167
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,480
That's exactly what we were doing.

1168
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,480
It was during his really puggie days.

1169
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,480
Uh-huh.

1170
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,480
He had a lot of makeup on, and it started to slide off.

1171
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,480
I think you're right.

1172
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,480
Now, that was big news over here, actually.

1173
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
The garbage cleaning.

1174
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,480
Yeah, I always go to New York for the big news events.

1175
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,480
And you know, there were a couple other people.

1176
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,480
I got really, really stink and drunk one night with Leslie Pinkney.

1177
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Well, I goodness.

1178
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,480
These are all people who used to work with us at thinking of ideas.

1179
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,480
And well, and it's, it's quasi relevant because Leslie is now vice president of music

1180
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,480
development for tempo, which is the Latin and Caribbean music channel owned by MTV Network.

1181
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,480
Okay.

1182
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,480
Interesting.

1183
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,480
So these people all kind of landed on their feet?

1184
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,480
Yeah.

1185
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,480
That's nice.

1186
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,480
Leslie's doing well.

1187
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,480
She looked great, and she can buy a mean shot or ten of patron silver.

1188
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:37,480
And the other person that I got really stink and drunk with.

1189
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,480
It was a theme.

1190
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,480
Separate occasion.

1191
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,480
Oh, yeah.

1192
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,480
Oh, yeah.

1193
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,480
Every night I was in New York was our old friend and former makeup artist to the stars.

1194
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Keon Stava.

1195
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
Keon.

1196
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,480
Oh, man.

1197
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,480
How was she doing?

1198
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,480
Keon's done really well.

1199
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
She's doing makeup.

1200
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,480
Whatever happened to Jimmy.

1201
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,480
Jimmy had a falling out with MTV Networks.

1202
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
And then he went to the west coast.

1203
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,480
And he was, I don't know what he got swallowed up.

1204
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,480
He got swallowed up.

1205
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
She knows.

1206
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
What he's doing.

1207
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,480
But I forgot.

1208
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
We were really drunk.

1209
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,480
I'm sure she told me.

1210
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,480
That's funny.

1211
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,480
Oh, wow.

1212
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,480
So yeah.

1213
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,480
She sends her love to you as well.

1214
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,480
Keon was always very cool.

1215
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,480
And I'm hot on the chair.

1216
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,480
I had a brief chat with JB and our friend JB Miller.

1217
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
JB Miller.

1218
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,480
You used to work at MTV with us with Steve Leads.

1219
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,480
He's can't remember where Steve wins.

1220
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,480
Oh, no.

1221
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,480
I talked to Leads all the time.

1222
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
Where is Steve now?

1223
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
He's not serious.

1224
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Yeah.

1225
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480
He's a satellite.

1226
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,480
He does talent, create coordination.

1227
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,480
So you know, all the Steve Leads.

1228
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,480
Yes, Steve Leads.

1229
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,480
Everyone who comes on to any show.

1230
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,480
It's not to be confused with this brother Harvey Lee.

1231
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
No, no, no.

1232
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,480
I saw Harvey a while back, too.

1233
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
But yeah, no, Steve is a, hey, baby.

1234
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
I'm on with Ken.

1235
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
You want to say hi to Keon.

1236
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Hey, baby.

1237
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
Hold on.

1238
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,480
Patricia.

1239
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,480
I put your earphones on, huh?

1240
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,480
Where are my earphones?

1241
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,480
There are the hang in there.

1242
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,480
The white ones.

1243
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,480
This may not be this may have to be a multiple installment show,

1244
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,480
because trouble is about to start.

1245
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Oh, okay.

1246
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
You got it on.

1247
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,480
You can hear me.

1248
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,480
Yeah.

1249
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,480
Say how to Ken.

1250
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,480
Oh, my God.

1251
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
It's like you're in the room here.

1252
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,480
I said, I wish you were.

1253
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,480
I want to.

1254
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,480
I said it.

1255
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,480
It felt like Adam was almost inside me when we used to,

1256
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,480
and I put it in the phone.

1257
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
Excuse me.

1258
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,480
It's been a while since we've talked.

1259
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
Yeah.

1260
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
And we've each other.

1261
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,480
So he was in stereo.

1262
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,480
She's me.

1263
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,480
Oh.

1264
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
I want to give you a hug.

1265
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,480
How are you, Patricia?

1266
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,480
I'm fine.

1267
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,480
I'm fine.

1268
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
I'm doing good.

1269
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,480
Very good.

1270
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,480
Very happy.

1271
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,480
Tell me about the house.

1272
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,480
Tell me about the house and then we'll hang up.

1273
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,480
You want to tell me about the house?

1274
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,480
No.

1275
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
No.

1276
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,480
Did you lower the,

1277
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,480
wait, new house?

1278
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,480
Yeah.

1279
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,480
Yeah, we finally found something.

1280
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,480
I think we found something.

1281
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,480
I'll send you a link.

1282
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
You know, can't see real estate.

1283
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
I know.

1284
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,480
He knows all about this.

1285
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Oh, yeah.

1286
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,480
Dude, you would clean up here.

1287
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,480
It's fucking mess.

1288
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,480
Eating well.

1289
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,480
Fucking mess.

1290
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,480
When are you coming over, dude?

1291
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,480
I think, well, I'm looking at my schedule now.

1292
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,480
And um, have all like a week from Friday.

1293
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,480
No, okay.

1294
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,480
I don't know.

1295
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,480
No, but you have.

1296
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,480
When am I going to just nip over to,

1297
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,480
to Portland, I would be easier for everyone

1298
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,480
to get together and stand for in Cisco.

1299
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,480
Wouldn't it, for you, yeah?

1300
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,480
Yeah.

1301
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,480
He's really saying that.

1302
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
He's really saying that.

1303
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,480
He's like, we're going to be in the meantime.

1304
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,480
The bottoms.

1305
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,480
They're all the time.

1306
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
And don't you go visit?

1307
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
No.

1308
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,480
Not a lot of them.

1309
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,480
No, not a lot.

1310
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,480
But she's been twice, dude.

1311
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,480
Well, that's what I'm saying in it.

1312
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,480
At that point, you're an hour and ten minutes away from me.

1313
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,480
So, you know, I should just nip down.

1314
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,480
Yeah.

1315
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,480
But that's saying.

1316
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
But that's your country.

1317
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
You have to see another.

1318
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,480
I would rather go to.

1319
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
I would rather go to London.

1320
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,480
Yeah.

1321
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,480
Well, there you go.

1322
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,480
I have to go.

1323
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,480
I have been in London and see everything this so much.

1324
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,480
You would love it.

1325
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
We'll go visit boy George together.

1326
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
It is.

1327
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
Well, it is my mother country.

1328
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
You know, I mean, my last.

1329
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,480
I know.

1330
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,480
Didn't I say that to you when I met you the first time?

1331
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,480
Are you English?

1332
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,480
Yes.

1333
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Actually, I am.

1334
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,480
Yes.

1335
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Can you tell by his accent?

1336
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,480
I know.

1337
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,480
Yes.

1338
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,480
Oh, we don't want to pass.

1339
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,480
There was a pass.

1340
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,480
A pass.

1341
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,480
A pass.

1342
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,480
A pass in the mix.

1343
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,480
A pass.

1344
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,480
Yes.

1345
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,480
And so Patricia came up here to get me down for dinner.

1346
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,480
Yes.

1347
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,480
It's been like 50 minutes.

1348
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,480
So we should stop anyway.

1349
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,480
All right.

1350
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,480
I guess that's enough for now.

1351
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,480
And it's going to send you everybody.

1352
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,480
Can wait for next year.

1353
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,480
But the 20.

1354
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,480
So it's to do our next in storm.

1355
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,480
Yeah.

1356
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,480
Now, listen, can't will you really come to San Francisco next time on there?

1357
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,480
It's entirely possible.

1358
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,480
It's a lot easier for me to nip down to San Francisco that it is a schedule time to go to English.

1359
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,480
You should come and you'd like it.

1360
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,480
You'd like it.

1361
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,480
It's a good vibe.

1362
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,480
Well, cool.

1363
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,480
We'll talk about that actually.

1364
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,480
Okay.

1365
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,480
Well, thanks for taking time out of your your morning can.

1366
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,480
Well, and thank you for having me.

1367
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,480
And so much fun.

1368
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,480
How do you want to say anything?

1369
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,480
Take a bite?

1370
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,480
I would just want to say goodbye.

1371
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,480
And I just want to see you can.

1372
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,480
I know.

1373
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,480
I love you.

1374
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,480
I want to see you too.

1375
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,480
But you know, I think of you.

1376
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,480
It's so frequently.

1377
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,480
You're with me almost as much on a daily basis as you were when I was working in

1378
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,480
Your home.

1379
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,480
Oh, really.

1380
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,480
Well, actually, it's the same that we do because sometimes we talk about you.

1381
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,480
I don't know.

1382
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
You know, sometimes it doesn't come up.

1383
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,480
Yeah.

1384
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
And I said, okay.

1385
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,480
I'm still there.

1386
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,480
I'm still there.

1387
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,480
You're still in there lurking in the corner.

1388
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,480
Yeah.

1389
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,480
You would not believe Christina though.

1390
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,480
You would not believe her.

1391
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,480
Well, the pictures every time I see a picture.

1392
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,480
I just my jaw falls.

1393
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
And I say, like, holy shit.

1394
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,480
Oh, no.

1395
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,480
Yeah.

1396
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,480
My little shark in.

1397
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,480
Yeah.

1398
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,480
I still have photos here.

1399
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,480
There's a photo in my office.

1400
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,480
From her, like, oh, I don't know.

1401
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,480
I remember being at her second birthday.

1402
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,480
But I think this photo is from like her fourth or fifth birthday.

1403
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,480
And it was that you had a pool party in your backyard.

1404
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,480
Um, so no.

1405
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,480
I look at pictures ever now.

1406
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,480
And I just, I feel like an old fuck.

1407
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,480
Yeah.

1408
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,480
And remember always naked.

1409
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,480
Always naked.

1410
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,480
She was always naked.

1411
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,480
The moment she came home, she would take off her clothes.

1412
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,480
She actually still does.

1413
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,480
Yeah.

1414
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,480
She does that.

1415
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,480
And I've left numerous times about her obsession over the pantyhose.

1416
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,480
Yeah.

1417
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,480
What was that?

1418
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,480
The pantyhose obsession.

1419
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,480
She wanted a pantyhose.

1420
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,480
Always.

1421
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,480
I just, she always nutrition.

1422
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
Telling her to stop with the pantyhose.

1423
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,480
I'll put them all in the fireplace.

1424
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,480
I got you.

1425
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,480
Really?

1426
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,480
Good one.

1427
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,480
She meant it.

1428
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,480
Mommy meant it.

1429
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,480
Yes.

1430
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Right.

1431
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,480
Oh, yeah.

1432
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,480
You have to see her.

1433
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,480
You have to see her.

1434
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,480
I know.

1435
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,480
Beautiful.

1436
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,480
So you got any stories on before we go?

1437
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,480

00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,480

1442
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,480
Remember we were discussing the fact that I had been in New York for the, for the 25th anniversary

1443
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,480
of MTV.

1444

Oh, you did.

1445
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,480
When I was talking about the,

1446
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,480
remember you used to go with us to Los Angeles.

1447
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,480
And we, we did a lot of fun stuff in Los Angeles.

1448
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,480
The only thing I just, I saw him again.

1449
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,480
John, uh,

1450
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,480

Yeah.

1453
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,480
You're coming in the neck.

1454
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,480
John Norris.

1455
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,480
And I remember he was sort of a go for them.

1456
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,480
You know.

1457
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,480
Yeah.

1458
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,480
Oh, he was here.

1459
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,480
He was a writer in the news department.

1460
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,480
I'm sorry.

1461
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,480
I thought he was a go for it.

1462
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,480

1463
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,480

1464
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,480
I could really clearly Patricia treated him as a go for it.

1465
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Hey.

1466
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,480
Hey, boy.

1467
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,480
We'll get my call.

1468
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,480
It was my latte.

1469
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,480
And he was in the back care of the car.

1470
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,480
I remember that.

1471
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,480
And we were in Los Angeles.

1472
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,480
In Los Angeles.

1473
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,480
And we had to go to somewhere on the mountain where you had an interview with somebody.

1474
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,480
Can he log in?

1475
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,480
Was that problem?

1476
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,480
I don't know.

1477
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,480
But he was in the back of the car.

1478
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,480
He was a very,

1479
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,480
uh,

1480
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,480
uptight,

1481
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,480
very nervous.

1482
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh, yeah.

1483
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,480
And you know,

1484
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,480
his eyes were very big and he was so.

1485
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
I thought you were going to say emaciated.

1486
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,480
Now maybe.

1487
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,480
But he was,

1488
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,480
he wanted to be at him.

1489
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,480
I just knew it.

1490
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
Really?

1491
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,480
Yeah.

1492
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
He was constantly looking into.

1493
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,480
And you,

1494
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,480
you could tell that he thought I won't be there.

1495
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,480
Oh.

1496
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
Oh.

1497
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,480
I'm in the wrong spot.

1498
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,480
Yeah.

1499
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,480
He got there.

1500
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,480
He got there.

1501
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,480
He got there.

1502
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,480
I mean,

1503
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,480
He got there.

1504
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,480
He got there.

1505
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,480
He got there.

1506
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,480
He got there.

1507
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,480
He got there.

1508
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,480
Oh, yeah.

1509
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,480
He got there.

1510
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,480
You got there.

1511
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,480
Huh.

1512
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,480
Aren't you glad we don't still do that by the way?

1513
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:53,200
Yeah, but it was always it was really really fun then, but thank God we don't still do that

1514
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,400
No, but then it was the MTV that you know MTV should have been you know

1515
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,560
Oh, hey, hey, that's not fair. MTV evolved. They had to do what they had to do. That's fine

1516
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:07,840
I know but it was it was it was the time when it was fun. Do you still do you think they still have fun?

1517
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,680
Yeah, I think they have fun. They probably have fun. I mean because they weren't there then

1518
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,160
So they don't have the perspective on it and there's always new people coming in and then there's no

1519
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:25,680
An exciting and no trends in do you know. I mean to us we we got old and jaded and it wasn't funny

1520
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,440
No, that's right. I started the suck the only thing I remember there was people got fired all the time

1521
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,600
Well, yeah, I mean revolving door bring it there. They were there and then we're gone. You mean VJs or you

1522
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,160
VJs everything well VJs and everyone else at the channel base

1523
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,840
I mean makeup is kind of a revolver, but I think that's the nature of the business and of television

1524
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:55,200
Yeah, I think so. I think so. I think so. Yeah, it was a bit of a springboard, but you know they brought people like Andrew

1525
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,280
Daddo from Australia

1526
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,760
Well, they was a nice guy. Yeah, he was all right, but

1527
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,040
There was that Richard Wilkins guy that you liked actually you got along with Richard. He was all right.

1528
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,280
He talked about that funny guy. He's still an actor an actor

1529
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:19,520
The funny guy. Yeah, the funny guy. He was so Kevin Steven Steven. No, I he's in Seattle and I think he went back to whatever his degree

1530
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:26,480
had been was like an engineering. Yeah, he was too into it. He was way too intelligent for that. He was

1531
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:33,520
saying well, I think he got through it all just by doing a lot of mushrooms. Yeah, screw probably was. Yeah,

1532
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:40,320
yeah, he was fucked up all the time all the time. Yeah, that's my money that in his infamous addition

1534
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,080
this bizarre way was it was it a special impersonation or something. He put on that shirt and tie and yeah,

1535
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,720
