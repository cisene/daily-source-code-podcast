1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, it's Adam Curry.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey, how are you doing?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm great.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How's everybody doing?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Uh, so what's up?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, I'm just sitting here counting the money.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We asked for it in small bills.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
$20, $50 increments.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And $15,000.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Selling up my pool at the Curry Castle.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And on the eighth day, God did create Marconi.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And Marconi did go forth upon the land and did give a radio unto humankind.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And God did look down from the heavens and smile for radio brought forth much joy and

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
grieving jams unto creation.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But the evil one, yay, even the man himself, did go forth and take control of radio, and

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
did make it unto his own image, which was not pleasant to look upon.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
God wept for humankind did become a generation of mindless drones.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But they no longer did hear sounds which were pleasing unto the years.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
For corporate radio to exude an extremely foul and loads some stench.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Therefore, God did send forth a Messiah, yay, even a golden-haired one named the pod father.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
To once again bring forth sounds pleasing unto the years and to bring down the man.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And there was great rejoicing again upon the land for the pod father to give us back control

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to the people.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And it was good.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And God did say, fuck corporate radio.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This shit rocketh.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you and now to Tallah day you are listening to the daily so-as-code episode

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
before 7-1.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In the next generation radio content in my years, I like to think I'm flying into the future.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I know I know my name is hard to say.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's always this drive that fumble every day.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So what's the best sounds that brought them down the way?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I'm the country, can't totally be yay.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now that the name does me justice, it never feels the same.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Forget what I'm going by and follow with.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can use my real name, just call me all the while I'm home but go away.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know I know my name is hard to say.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's always this drive that fumble every day.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So I know my name is hard to say.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's always this drive that fumble every day.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's always this drive that fumble every day.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now that fumble every day, it never feels the same.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now that fumble every day, it never feels the same.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Forget what I'm going by and follow with.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can use my real name, just call me all the while I'm home but go away.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All the while I'm home but go away.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My father's making this while I'm in his father's name.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I know my name is hard to say.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's always this drive that fumble every day.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Now that fumble every day, it never feels the same.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now that fumble every day, it never feels the same.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now that fumble every day, it never feels the same.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now that fumble every day, it never feels the same.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now that fumble every day, it never feels the same.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now that fumble every day, it never feels the same.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, there's a lot of stars left.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why did that?

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Got an email from, what is it?

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Cody Newman, who plays guitar.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know if he sings, and I think he might sing on the track.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And he said, would you give my, would you give my shit a listen?

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And I have something really nice about it was kind of raw kind of,

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know, it felt good.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I've got another track up there called a riddle in and good stories in the songs as well.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's the daily source code coming to you from the Curry Cottage and the affluent

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Suburb of Suri known as Gilford in the UK Apologies about Friday.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I know I didn't, I didn't get a show out.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It was incredibly busy.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I told you that we had all the folks coming in from San Francisco.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Some even coming in from Ontario, California after the podcast expo.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And today it's going to be a crazy week.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We had the digital music awards happening this Tuesday, which is for television broadcast

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
on Channel 4 in the UK.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But we're going to be there starting today.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We're set up today.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And then tomorrow we have VIP sweet with lots of beautiful people running around.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Which whoever anyone who's a celebrity is basically going to be heard

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
into our area.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And hopefully they will get quite an experience.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We're going to be streaming all of this live, which is a new experience for

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
pod show, although not new for a lot of people who've worked at pod show.

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But it's going to be very interesting.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I think we're going to turn the stream on tomorrow afternoon UK time,

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
which will probably be what is that two in the morning Pacific Coast time.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So yeah, somewhere in the early morning hours as we're,

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
we continue to hold unditions here in the UK as well.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it's going to be a fun, fun ride.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I'm basically trying to squeak out a show here today before I head off for

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
set up at the, well, it's at the roundhouse.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So it's kind of nuts.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But I think that there will be some interesting stuff to look at.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Keep your eye on BTpodshow.com.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You know, with all these, these crazy days, you know,

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
there's, there's nothing really quite as important as keeping your mental health

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
together and your physical health.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And of course, the health of your ass.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And tonight.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Here to save my ass once again.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Amy.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
How you doing girl?

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Adam, it's Amy Mac.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey, baby, how are you?

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm so glad you felt last week's exercise.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was starting to worry.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You didn't have any ass muscles to save.

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, please.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Today is day nine and you're going to need your wireless.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, hold on a second.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All right.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Ready?

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yep.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Ready?

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Lay down your stomach to the floor.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't make to the floor.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hands to your side.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hands to the sides.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The shoulder with a part and toes perpendicular to the floor.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Perfectly go to the floor.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now lift your shoulders off the floor and squeeze your shoulder blades together.

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Bring your arms to the ceiling and then toward each other a little bit

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
to help hold those shoulder blades together.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, that's horrible.

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Keep your head in line with your spine so you don't strain your neck.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, Amy.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Now, of course, you squeeze your butt.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Great.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now hold.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Make sure your feet stay on the ground.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, on the ground.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm squeezing.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm squeezing.

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's what I thought.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And relax.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I feel vulnerable like this.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Round two.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Up and squeeze.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Now you probably noticed that we're working the back muscles too.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But I figured a little bonus would hurt.

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thank you.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Last few seconds.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Squeeze that part.

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And down.

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Great.

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Last one.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
One more.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Shoulders up.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Squeeze the butt.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Breathe.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
All right.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Your homework is to do a couple more of these some time this week.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, and of course, let's do a little fitness attack podcast at fitness.potshow.com.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All right.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Come down.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Thank you.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Have a great weekend.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm spending mine in sunny southern California.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll be meeting with podshow towel relations.

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I can't decide if I should have a taco or not shows a taco bar.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What do you think?

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, anyway.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Until next time.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you so much.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
As a result.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Correct.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Of course, Amy sent that to me for Friday.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And I didn't get to it.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So that's what she was talking about.

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The Taco Bell meetings at the podcast.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Expo.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Amy, thank you so much.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I did feel my lower back.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But that was kind of weird.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I did feel quite vulnerable in that position.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
New video show dropped.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That was over the weekend or maybe it was on Friday as well.

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The high fee show.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You've got to see this.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is a video show, which is produced by Kevin App's who did day.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I think it was an award-winning documentary.

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Was it straight out a hundred point?

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was at the I think it did well.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's Sundance.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And the high fee movement is this actually.

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I can give you the definition of high fee.

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let me see.

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a high fee dot poncho dot com.

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Since, say, oh, this since say a moment brought to you by the high fee show.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And you spell that hotel Yankee Papa hotel Yankee.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
High fee.

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
High fee show.

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
High fee dot poncho dot com.

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I know on their site.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm going to go to it right now.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
They have a definition of what high fee is.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And this will give you a little idea about the show.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
High fee.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
A grassroots hip hop movement that originated in the San Francisco Bay area that breaks down

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the social barriers by promoting sporadic partying.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wild loose dancing.

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Also known as going dumb.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Gaudy and outlanders fashion outspokenness,

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
witty and farsical slang,

215
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and spastic and positively vived acting out all while remaining free of corporate influence.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
High fee.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Damn, high fee.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What is this?

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is one of these days.

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm telling you.

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Someone called me, I guess.

222
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Of course, moody.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Always calling.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Never giving you a fricking second to do anything.

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So you've got to see this.

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Malica is the host of the show.

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
As I said Kevinette,

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
App's produces and directs it.

229
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think Malica might have been on MTV.

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I have some kind of feeling she did that.

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But this to me is very reminiscent in a different way,

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
but kind of the same excitement that we had when Dr. Dre and Ed Lover started doing

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yo MTV rap.

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It was something really new, really different.

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And this is just, it's just high fee.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, I'm pity love from local radio and the daddy cast.

237
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Just wanted to let you know on the daddy cast episode 50 that are released last week.

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The topic was missing children.

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And basically went into a story about a friend who a friend of a friend who had

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
misplaced their childhood a theme park and they found him after about half an hour.

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But when it ended some research on some sites found out,

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
a list of things parents should do if they ever think their child is missing.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And as a parent, I'm sure you can understand,

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
especially when Christina was younger.

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you, if they were out of your site for a while,

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you really start to get concerned and your mind can get into a mindset of just pure panic,

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
pretty quickly.

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Ah, of course, as teenagers, you kind of expect them to get lost sometimes.

249
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But anyway, one of the things that came out of it was the idea of

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
creating a packet of information, recent pictures, a description, a list of people

251
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to contact in case your child would go missing.

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I don't know, I guess it's kind of, you know, as a pilot,

253
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you probably understand preparation is a big thing.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So just wanted to encourage your listeners to do something like that to create a packet

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
or prepare something in case their child would be missing or something

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
would happen to them or you would just need it.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I always better to have it and not need it than to need it, not have it.

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So you never know what your mind's going to be like when a child is missing

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
or there's an emergency of that nature.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So just wanted to pass that along.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You can listen to the Daddycast episode 50.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you want to hear the full list of things they, they say to do in the first 24 hours,

263
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
but because this is kind of a PSA.

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Anyway, thanks a lot Adam.

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And scrunch your folder.

266
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I guess now I'm a converted folder.

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I've never thought about toilet paper and wiping my butts and much

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
than I have in the last few months.

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you very little.

270
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Talk to you later. Bye-bye.

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Proud to have influenced you, my friend.

272
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, it's kind of a morbid thought, but I thought it was a good topic just to throw out

273
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
there because it's true.

274
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Crap, man.

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Christina was a she had a nice adventure.

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Maybe she waited to talk with Patricia about this on the show, of course.

277
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
She had quite an adventure Friday night.

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She went to London to go visit someone with Liam and the last train back

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
was canceled and then she found out how difficult it really is

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
as a teenager, which did not throw lost at all.

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We were in constant contact with her, but this was not our idea of a perfect Friday night

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
to have her in London trying to grab a cab to drive her back, which

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
believe me, London cabs, they look at, you know, I'm sure they looked at her

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and looked at Liam and said, no, you kids won't be able to pay for.

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They've been through that too many times and a long story.

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Anyway, yeah, keep an eye on your kids.

287
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Pretty interesting how people are using the voice mill feedback

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
number as like a voice mill number for me.

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And there's all kinds of things.

290
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Invitations to speak at conferences, people trying to figure out

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
if I'm available for other opportunities.

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And then there's this, which was really kind of freaky.

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hi Adam, one of your listeners, and I went to second life because of you,

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and my name and second life is Jill Piamma,

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
who's a T-I-A-M-A.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And I've sent you some messages because as it turns out,

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I met someone in second life that knows you from childhood,

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and really needs to reach you.

299
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So I like you to email me and I will get your contact information to them

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and say it's kind of like a sad message, but I don't want to leave it on here.

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, wait a minute, man.

302
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So someone from my childhood is trying to reach me

303
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that doesn't really peek my interest that much because when I think of childhood,

304
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm thinking like, who the hell could that be?

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And then to hear that it's kind of a sad story,

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
doesn't give me a good feeling.

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You know, typically this turns out to be someone who needs me to help them with something

308
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
that I really don't want to do.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This has happened many times before, and what I don't like is,

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
you know, how come this person look?

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's very easy to get a message to me.

312
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And this message has come in through every single avenue except my email,

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and every single avenue except directly to me from this so-called childhood friend,

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
because it's come through our sales department,

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and I've just ignored it.

316
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know, because it's always like, well, there's a childhood friend.

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You know, who is the childhood friend?

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Tell me who it is, and then maybe I'll respond.

319
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm not just going to jump out and say, oh sure.

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Not a problem.

321
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Have them call me.

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And preferably have them call me because this is great content.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hi, this is Barry J. and Jess from Radio QRM.

324
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Hey there.

325
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Well, the leaves are changing up here in New Hampshire, and right now the roads are just clogged

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
without a state tours.

327
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They drive hundreds of miles just to stare at leaves falling off trees.

328
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We like to call this the leaf peeper season.

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Jess, look over there.

330
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
11 o'clock by the boulder.

331
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Got him.

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
When we're not hunting peepers,

333
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Jess and I do a weekly podcast from the Menadlock region in New Hampshire.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Jess, peeper, two o'clock.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That'll look good on the mantle.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This show is a little home spun humor, five o'clock, Jess.

337
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That one won't be bothering us anymore.

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
A little news.

339
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Jess, over there by the scarecrows.

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That was a trick you on.

341
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And a little fun with life in New Hampshire.

342
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Jess, PA plates on the Hummer.

343
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I see it, hold on.

344
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh, yeah.

345
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And we also featured great music from the Podsafe Music Network.

346
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So check us out at radioqrm.com or visit our podshow site at radioqrm.potshow.com.

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, is that a charter bus from New York City?

348
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Barry J.

349
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Hand me my halitzer.

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We're going to be sitting from New Hampshire.

351
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is radioqrm.

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
By the way, no leaf peepers were actually harmed during the production of this promo.

353
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
If this promo upsets you, grow a thicker skin.

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This podcast is rated in PC for not politically correct.

355
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, and folder.

356
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Folder.

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Folder.

358
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Rally?

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I think that's Barry J.

360
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's not Barry from the cast blaster form.

361
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He's an admin on castblaster.com.

362
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And it actually came.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I realized that this morning as I got another email from someone saying,

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm interested in getting started in podcasting.

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You know, what should I use?

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And it's been so long ago that I keep forgetting that

367
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
your cast blaster was created specifically for this.

368
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And a cast blaster Mike poured a whole lot of it continues to pour just tons of energy

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and love into the product.

370
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And it's damn skipy.

371
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'd have to say.

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I use it every single day.

373
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And it may not be the way you want to produce your audio in general,

374
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
because a lot of people like piecing bits together and making, you know,

375
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
basically doing that all at post editing, putting stuff into place.

376
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I like the idea of old school.

377
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Just turn on the microphone.

378
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You got your shit loaded up.

379
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You just started the beginning and you ended the end.

380
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And cast blasters fantastic for that really good for organizing all your stuff.

381
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hello. I don't miss Matthew and Newton not so affluent.

382
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah.

383
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I just got a bit of a tinfoil at my moment for you.

384
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Well, you're not okay.

385
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ten-four.

386
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Ten-four.

387
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Ten-four.

388
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Ten-four.

389
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Ten-four.

390
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Ten-four.

391
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Ten-four.

392
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Ten-four.

393
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Ten-four.

394
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Ten-four.

395
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Ten-four.

396
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I know, it's time for the tinfoil hat moment, okay, man. I hope it doesn't disappoint. You got the jing.

397
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm making the the the problem at the garage in many house.

398
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay, he's talking about our new house where there's a common interest against converting the garage.

399
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's something to do, link spooky, maybe I know Medieval, the header, link.

400
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Or something to spooky on those lines. Also, what it was, where's Malcolm in Abu Dhabi from there, didn't throw up.

401
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Anyway, take care and love a show. Bye.

402
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm trying to sneeze. Excuse me.

403
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't think so. It turns out I think all the homes there have a covenant on converting the garage.

404
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I'd apparently was put in place so that people would park their cars in the garage and not on the side. Why do you know this question, right?

405
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Why do we drive on a parkway and park on the driveway?

406
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But where is Malcolm in Abu Dhabi? I sometimes I'll just send me a little email thing. I'll just jot something off, which I'd always like.

407
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But indeed, we have not heard from Malcolm, his his low enchanting tomber from Abu Dhabi.

408
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Perhaps he shall he'll be motivated soon to weigh in again.

409
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Podcast Expo was held over the weekend, Friday and Saturday, I believe.

410
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Portable Media Expo was the official title. And of course, Pod Show had how to show in there.

411
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:51,000
As you know, we don't really believe in conferences per se. And we'd like to get people together when they are together and have a good time and participate as we feel fit.

412
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And it was a lot, I mean, if you just look around, if you go on to, what is it?

413
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's a lot of fun to shoot. There's so many different places you can find information about what happened at the Portable Media Expo.

414
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Not a lot of web blogs, actually, because of course, this is a very different type of medium.

415
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So I'm still looking for like keynotes and stuff happen, which is kind of funny isn't it that it's this portable media podcasting expo.

416
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And there's very little of the event itself. I would have really enjoyed to have heard the keynotes, at least.

417
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Of course, I've read transcripts of the keynotes.

418
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So we had a pretty big bunch of people out there. Of course, we also have a bunch of people out here in London, so it's very busy.

419
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And luckily some feedback did come in.

420
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Hey Adam, this is Mike.

421
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And this is Michelle.

422
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
From the Michael Michelle show.

423
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And I've got to make a culpa.

424
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes, you do.

425
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, I do.

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Because this weekend, in particular, at the Portable Media Expo, what became really, really obvious to me was how good a job Pod Show is doing taking care of its stars.

427
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I love Pod Show.

428
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And Michelle, just signed with Whisper Pearls for Pod Show.

429
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'd like to show rules.

430
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah.

431
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Adam rules especially.

432
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Pod Show really rules.

433
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And I just wanted to say, I'm impressed.

434
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh yeah.

435
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, I am.

436
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What's impressive about Pod Show?

437
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Like I said, I think they're making the right moves.

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You know, they're supportive of the stars.

439
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And I like the interface on the website.

440
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And I like what happened this weekend.

441
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And I like the little things that aren't terribly expensive necessarily by themselves.

442
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But the show that you're thinking about your stars and that you care like the limo.

443
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And then actually shuddling people around for a couple of days.

444
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's a classy move.

445
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Like the limo.

446
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We had a Hummer, a stretch Hummer limo.

447
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Which according to Mark Yoshimot, an MCO snowed a little bit of puke.

448
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Because of course, who else is is renting a Hummer limo, but someone is going to get trashed and puke in it.

449
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And we had Andrew, who we affectionately call crayon, his nickname.

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It was completely dressed out as a huggie bear, a 70s-type pin, who was shuddling people around.

451
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That was because we had our hospitality, sweet at the Sheraton as we were not allowed to have that at the Marriott.

452
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That was a agreement, I guess, the Marriott and the Borkwood brothers had.

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So yeah, so we had to shuddle people back and forth.

454
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It was an interesting vehicle.

455
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That's for sure.

456
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Absolutely.

457
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
There you go.

458
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
All right.

459
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And that's pretty much what I wanted to say.

460
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
All right.

461
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And thank you for taking good care of Michelle, Adam.

462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I love you, Adam.

463
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Peace.

464
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Bye.

465
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah, you got to listen to whispered pearls.

466
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Without a doubt, one of the sexy shows I've heard.

467
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Very, very sexy.

468
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And Michelle, of course, was nice enough to send me a naked picture of her sister, which is almost better than a naked picture of yourself in my book.

469
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Uh, let's see.

470
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh, I did see some interesting video of the rumor girls in the pool.

471
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That was kind of hot.

472
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And Angie B was there, too, of course.

473
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Hey, Adam.

474
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's Angie B.

475
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And that just got back from the Pod Show on Expo 2 this weekend.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And boy, you really missed out on a good time.

477
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Pod Show put on a great party.

478
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You totally missed out.

479
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It was so great to meet all the people that I've been talking to all these months.

480
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Like the rumor girls and CC Chapman and Julian Smith and Marcus Couch.

481
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And met some other folks, too.

482
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Brother Love was really cool.

483
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And had a long conversation with Joe Klein.

484
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah.

485
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, they just organized ear off about the old days while we were sitting around.

486
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Cool side doing the wonderful Pod Show rewind live show.

487
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So fun to be a part of that.

488
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So, um, I don't know.

489
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We all missed your man.

490
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Hopefully, uh, you can find in your heart to go next time.

491
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You missed out on your own party, dude.

492
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It was fun.

493
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Oh, well, dude.

494
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's not like I didn't want to go.

495
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's like, uh, a man has his obligations.

496
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You know, we had all this stuff set up with with BT with the DMA.

497
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And before that, of course, I really would have been tough to travel because my paperwork

499
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
was not in order.

500
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Which it now is luckily.

501
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm free to cross the border whenever I want for whatever reason I want.

502
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Uh, so of course, I would have loved to have been there.

503
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And she's especially because you were there, baby.

504
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Uh-huh.

505
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Um, by the way, I want to thank Jason Calacanus for that intro to the show today.

506
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Um, he was a, there was a Gilmore gang.

507
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And this is actually, um, and before for me, it was very interesting to listen to this

508
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
particular episode of the Gilmore gang, which I think the first two, it's a, you know, it's a multi-hour

509
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
conversation broken up into three or four parts.

510
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And I said, listen to the first two parts.

511
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And it was all about pod shows, uh, announcement of our most recent, uh, financing, which is

512
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
a series B, uh, it's a term for, uh, different type of stock.

513
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Uh, and the amount is 15 million dollars.

514
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And when I was listening to that conversation with some very intelligent guys, and I, and

515
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I put Jason Calacanus right up there with very intelligent guys, it was quite amazing

516
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
for me to, uh, once again, you know, have to witness that when, when there's a topic that

517
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
you really know something about and you know all the ins and outs of, of, of the discussion,

518
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
here that people usually really don't know what they're talking about.

519
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And these, these guys are analysts, but they're, I'd have to say they're more technology

520
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
analysts than they are media analysts and that, and that's kind of where they're making

521
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
some, some positions and, uh, just pure mistakes and thought.

522
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And I actually considered today, um, doing one of those.

523
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Let's listen to the whole show and comment on each piece.

524
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Excuse me.

525
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Uh, but I just don't have the time for it, but I, but I, I think I would like to do that,

526
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
because it's so funny, some of the things they're saying.

527
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The funniest has to be that, uh,

528
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Podshow is raised this money to, uh,

529
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
uh, what is it to, uh,

530
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
roll up a whole bunch of other companies?

531
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Uh-huh.

532
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah.

533
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Okay.

534
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That's, that's a good theory.

535
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
We saw Dave Winner posted and removed, uh, two theories.

536
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
One was Podshow needs the 15 million to battle lawsuits from Apple.

537
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Theory number two.

538
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
A Podshow needs the 15 million dollars to, for rebranding to evade lawsuits from Apple.

539
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
That's too bad he removed the post because it was so stupid.

540
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm going to have been great to have had that out there.

541
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Uh, no, it's, uh, because we're enabling people to do what they love.

542
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That's what it is.

543
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
We may not be a company that, uh, that goes around boasting about our numbers,

544
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
both in subscribers, listeners, and advertising dollars,

545
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
but clearly something's going the right way.

546
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I think that's all I really need to say for now.

547
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Uh, and if we want to get into a real conversation about it,

548
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
listen to that Gilmour gang and then get back to me.

549
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Preferably in, uh, in audio format because, because that's fun.

550
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So, uh, I'm just, uh, just, uh, ring with a question for you.

551
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Thinking about how, um, when I first started listening to the DSC,

552
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
he was really excited about, so I'd rather love and his music and how you'd sign them to be on label.

553
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Well, it's been a little while now, and there's, uh, Kevin Reeves and a number of other bands.

554
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
How would you say the, the selection of top quality songs that I'd want to public using now,

555
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
compared to when it was just by the love is kind of the one and only of the best,

556
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
the best, um, just the question for you if I might want to answer on the DSC.

557
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah. Take care then. Bye.

558
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Okay. So, um, I don't like the question of, you know,

559
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
what is the top or what is the best because that's all subjective.

560
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You know, I made like one thing that you hate and vice versa.

561
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I don't really think it's about number of spins for an artist that says it's better.

562
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's just maybe popular with a certain group that is playing it.

563
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You know, I don't look at it that way.

564
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
However, I like the fact that you're asking how the, uh,

565
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
pot-sick music network is doing. Well, it's doing quite well.

566
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Uh, and we're still in the process of integrating pot-shoot plus and the pot-sick music network.

567
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You're going to see some changes, uh, that are coming along quite quickly.

568
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Now, finally, as we're learning how to, uh, create better admin tools for our producers and hosts and managers and admins,

569
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
um, what's very exciting is we did it a little tally and we ran some numbers.

570
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Because, of course, the pot-sick music network is in effect of very simple yet necessary.

571
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And I think in a way revolutionary concept, although it's not really inventing anything new,

572
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
it's the concept of a very simple license that enables creative work to be used for one specific use.

573
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So we're creative commons is fantastic because it really enables all different types of uses under certain circumstances.

574
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
This is the very specific license as it pertains to using someone's song in an audio production.

575
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And a part of that deal is that the person who uses the song reports that back.

576
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So we have a, um, I think on the pot-sick music network, uh, about,

577
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
is this a 13 or 18% of the shows that, uh, use and report to the network, um,

578
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
have a relationship with pod show, so we know a lot about their numbers.

579
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Statistically, that's a very good sample size.

580
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Uh, when you do all the numbers, it turns out that since it's inception, there have been,

581
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I think it's 215 million spins of pod-sick music songs.

582
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So, and, and a spin would be, I saw I played a song, uh, the top of the show.

583
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And every single person who heard that, I'm going to say, is a spin.

584
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Uh, you could say impression, but it doesn't sound so cool.

585
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So that's how, that's how many different pieces of work have been impressed upon people.

586
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And, you know, when people are listening to a show, they're listening to the show,

587
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
so they heard the song, they may have skipped over it.

588
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's entirely possible, but they were exposed to it.

589
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And I think that is just phenomenal. I love it to bits.

590
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
We still need to, uh, finish off with, uh, with the, and that will go, as I've said before,

591
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
that will come with the integration of pod show plus and the pod team music network.

592
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We got to get all the songs, uh, and there's going to be a couple things we'll be able to enable the song for sale,

593
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
which the artist has complete control over.

594
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
We don't have to. We've also got a couple of other ways for you to license it for movies, film,

595
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
television, and other non-podcast related uses, which is also an opt-in.

596
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You can check box, one song, all your songs, the individual tracks,

597
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and a couple other opportunities that it's just coming at us.

598
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You know, and all we're doing is just plug it in, given the artist, the, the capability,

599
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
to, um, to market their stuff and to monetize on it.

600
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Not a lot of direct monetization for pod show in that, but man,

601
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
does it really enable us to make cool shows with awesome music?

602
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'd have to say definitely.

603
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Thanks for the question.

604
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Got a note from my sister Willow in Italy.

605
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And she lets me know that she started an audiobook cast, an audiobook and episodes,

606
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
or a potty of book, of my mom's, at our mom's 1993 novel,

607
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
written according to the guidelines of the UK, uh,

608
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Trashy novels.

609
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's called The Time to Love.

610
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And she's just uploaded the first, uh, episode.

611
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So it's, it's rough.

612
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
She says big time amateur hour, but something I wanted to do.

613
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So she, you know, she is actually, she's fulfilling one of my mom's wishes,

614
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
which is publishing her book, a time to love.podshow.com.

615
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I, uh, I have not listened to it yet.

616
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I wasn't quite ready, uh, but I've got it loaded up, and so when I go,

617
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
when I take the train into the city today, I'm going to listen to the first episode,

618
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
a time to love.podshow.com.

619
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Very cool.

620
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Hey, Adam, it's Matt from the Dayton show, and oh, yes, it's a long time.

621
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So I've left the message, and I just wanted to do, uh,

622
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
introduce some news and regards to all things butterflies.

623
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
A couple of weeks ago, my wife ran in her first triathlon that benefited

624
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
breast cancer research.

625
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And as we were leaving, standing, hoping you're tracing,

626
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
we were swarmed with butterflies flying all over the place.

627
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I thought, well, it's not interesting, but, you know,

628
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
they could live here there, so I didn't really think much of it.

629
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And then the other day, when I'm in the office up on 31st floor,

630
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I look up the window, and there's a butterfly covering outside the window,

631
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
caught in an updraft.

632
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And I thought, all right, that's a little stranger.

633
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And then I said, if you're today waiting to board a flight for the portable media

634
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
expo, I look out and see a butterfly flying directly over my plane,

635
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and I thought, okay, now I'm convinced Adam's mother must be looking

636
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
over me and over this flight.

637
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So thought that might brighten up your day, and just when we let you know

638
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
that I was thinking about that, so take care.

639
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I really appreciate that thought, man.

640
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Thank you for calling you.

641
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And it's not, I don't really, obviously, you know,

642
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
my mom's spirit has not taken over this butterfly specifically for you,

643
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
but I think it does show that we're in the universe.

644
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We're all connected.

645
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We're all part of the same infrastructure.

646
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's the same atoms bashing up against each other,

647
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
organized into shapes and forms and mass, et cetera,

648
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
but we're all connected one way or the other kind of like,

649
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
you know, hurricane.

650
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's not a thing.

651
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's it's wind that comes together,

652
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
it's and wind all over the planet is a part of that.

653
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Literally on the other side of the globe,

654
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
while there's a hurricane taking place,

655
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
there is a connectedness between between those two,

656
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and I think that's what we're seeing.

657
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And something about this crazy ass network that we've been building this

658
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
internet thing, something about it is,

659
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
it's meant to be for that reason, you know,

660
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
some of that connectedness is I think is going to come out of it,

661
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and we may be 50 years before we finally figure out what we can really do

662
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
with an interconnected network like this,

663
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
but it is something that's happening and it's,

664
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
that is it's very basic form where I talk about the butterflies,

665
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and then that connectedness.

666
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It probably has always been there,

667
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
it's just now you happen to see it.

668
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Matt, thank you very much.

669
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Hey, Adam, it's the other Carmen from the cheese pod.

670
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm whispering because DJG is sleeping.

671
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's about midnight here in the states.

672
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We've got to be up at five,

673
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and that's just to let you know how damn special you are today,

674
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
that I would call you at midnight.

675
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And the reason I'm calling you is because I was just at a restaurant,

676
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and in front of my ass mouth,

677
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I had done a new iPod lately,

678
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and he meant podcasts,

679
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and that's not good.

680
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So I thought you should know,

681
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
there are some people out there who think podcasts are iPods.

682
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'll pick this ass for you, man.

683
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I don't do that.

684
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I appreciate it, but not necessary.

685
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

686
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Some thought about that.

687
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So this is part of that whole Apple trademark issue

688
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
that's been discussed at Nazium.

689
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And I, you know, it's probably true.

690
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It probably is true that when people think of pod today,

691
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and today's day and age,

692
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
they are mainly thinking about the iPod,

693
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and when they hear podcasts,

694
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
if they haven't heard of what a podcast is,

695
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
or think in something with your iPod,

696
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I have to agree that that is just fundamentally a fact.

697
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Is it a huge portion of the population?

698
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I really don't know.

699
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Do I think most people don't have iPods,

700
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and don't know about podcasting?

701
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

702
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So yeah, there's something to it.

703
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But there's, you know,

704
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
why do we have, you know,

705
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Leo Report,

706
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I only read the transcript as I said.

707
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'd love to see the,

708
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I love to see video of possible of his keynote.

709
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
He talked about this,

710
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and he suggested net casting.

711
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I think that's just as bad.

712
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The whole idea of what we're doing,

713
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
it doesn't have to be grouped under one common denominator.

714
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It really doesn't.

715
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Instead of focusing on people recognizing the name,

716
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
what pod show has been doing particularly.

717
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And by the way, you know,

718
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
there you go,

719
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
we chose a pod, a pod name, pod show.

720
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That may have some disadvantages,

721
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
but instead of going around promoting

722
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
our brand and pod casting,

723
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
we really try to get the content in front of the audience.

724
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
That's the trick, you know,

725
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and that's a different type of, of message.

726
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So instead of saying,

727
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you know,

728
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
there's this, this new kind type of broadcasting,

729
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and it's really cool.

730
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I think it's much better to say,

731
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
hey, look at this,

732
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
or hey, listen to this.

733
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That I think is,

734
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
is much more powerful.

735
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And that's really what,

736
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
what we've been focusing on.

737
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's trying to get the great stuff that we believe in,

738
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
at least,

739
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
in front of audience.

740
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And that comes in many different forms.

741
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's not just on the web.

742
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's,

743
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
it will eventually be on mobile,

744
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
so that there's some stuff to figure.

745
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I think Nokia's doing a pretty good job.

746
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I know comics are bloggers going to hate me for saying it,

747
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
but I have to say that pod casting application on their phones.

748
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Ain't too shabby.

749
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But what we're doing in British telecom,

750
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
you know,

751
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
BT vision.

752
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
This is going to be the new television box.

753
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And what did they just announced something today?

754
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh, they did a deal with,

755
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I think,

756
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Birdlesman BMG.

757
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So you'll be able to watch videos on demand on BT vision.

758
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So that won't,

759
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't think it's going to be for pay.

760
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm not sure.

761
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It may be,

762
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
but I would think that you can just pull them up on demand,

763
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
which would be pretty cool.

764
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And that's,

765
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
that what a great deal that is.

766
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You know,

767
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
that's pointing content in front of audience.

768
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And giving them a way to get more and find it easily.

769
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That part, of course,

770
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
makes a hell of a lot of sense.

771
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So,

772
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
did have an interesting experience over the weekend,

773
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Saturday,

774
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
morning,

775
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Patricia woke me up.

776
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
She says,

777
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm downstairs,

778
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
just enjoying a cup of tea with the,

779
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
with the F.T.

780
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm like,

781
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
F.T.

782
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I usually use she reads the independent

783
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and the daily mirror,

784
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and I read the financial time.

785
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
She says,

786
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
no, the Frank truth.

787
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So, oh,

788
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
even the Frank truth podcast,

789
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
she said,

790
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
yeah.

791
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Because I'd set up her iTunes.

792
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So, it would automatically,

793
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
you know,

794
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
subscribe to the Frank truth.

795
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So, did you listen to items?

796
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
No?

797
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Because, of course, she had forgotten it,

798
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
or it wasn't paying attention when I showed her.

799
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So, I went to Pod Show,

800
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and I went to find it,

801
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and I put in Frank Sinatra,

802
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
or I think maybe she put in Frank Sinatra

803
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
or Frank truth,

804
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and it came up with the Frank truth podcast.

805
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So, I clicked play and it worked.

806
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And she said,

807
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
no, by the way,

808
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
that high fee show looks pretty good.

809
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So, we're talking about it.

810
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Well, that's what came up when I went to podshow.com,

811
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and some kind of promo for high fee show.

812
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Like,

813
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
God, this is cool.

814
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Now,

815
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
work when the lady Patricia,

816
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
who will not listen to my own show,

817
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the show that she's on,

818
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is doing that.

819
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Something very cool is happening.

820
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Oh,

821
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
oh,

822
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
oh,

823
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
oh,

824
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
God,

825
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
these were prints,

826
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
don't you?

827
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But maybe,

828
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I need some bread.

829
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So,

830
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
give her a life,

831
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
to the rest of the world.

832
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
All we've got is Jesse's.

833
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah, yeah, it's Jesse's.

834
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yo,

835
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
what's up,

836
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Adam and Jersey Todd,

837
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
the official music artist of the Chacha.

838
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So, hey,

839
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I figured there's a lot of folk out at the west coast

840
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
at the PPM here,

841
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
or whatever it's called.

842
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And,

843
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
you know,

844
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm going out there this year,

845
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
maybe next year.

846
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But I got somebody from Jersey,

847
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
of course.

848
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
In fact, she's a real Jersey girl.

849
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Her name is Jersey Jung.

850
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I played her on my show a couple of months ago,

851
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and she finally uploaded a song to the pot,

852
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
pot saved music network,

853
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and I like it a lot.

854
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
The song is called How It Ends.

855
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And I love her voice.

856
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I love her texture to her song.

857
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I love the passion behind her voice.

858
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
She's got a four song EP out.

859
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
She's playing little clubs.

860
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
This is the kind of person that podcasting was made for.

861
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Because you're going to hear this song,

862
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
you're going to love it,

863
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and a lot of other people are going to love it too,

864
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and play it on their shows,

865
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and get into a whole mess of new years.

866
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So, on the daily source code,

867
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
this is Jersey Jung with How It Ends.

868
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Have a great time, everybody.

869
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I give you all that time,

870
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
that I can.

871
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So you're going to love how it got,

872
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
little man.

873
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If I were a nicer girl,

874
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
would you stay?

875
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh, no,

876
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm going to start in another battle,

877
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
anyway.

878
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So, I should have freedom to handle.

879
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Know how it's going to end.

880
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
When you're going to give me a hug,

881
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
when you care.

882
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You're going to have freedom to handle.

883
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Know how it's going to end.

884
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
When you're going to give me a hug,

885
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
when you care.

886
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

887
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,100
Help!

888
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:06,980
I'm sayin' someone else to make you alright, where'd youachen?

889
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,960
God's mine should I breathe to hell and I don't, no how it's gonna hell.

890
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:20,380
And if you're gonna give me love where you can,

00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:26,140
if you're gonna soon I breathe to hell and I don't, no, no how it's gonna,

00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,140
Oh, and you're gonna give me a hug when you can

893
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,140
Cause I'm wasting these days

894
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,140
I'm wasting with them

895
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:50,140
I'm wasting my time

896
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:54,140
Yeah, I'm saving your name

897
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,140
I can't turn away

898
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,140
Cause you stay in my head

899
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,140
My mind

900
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,140
You want me to tell you

901
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,140
Know how it's gonna help

902
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,140
Oh, and you're gonna give me a hug when you can

903
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,140
Yeah, I should've put it together

904
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,140
Oh, no, how it's gonna help

905
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:30,140
Oh, and you're gonna give me a hug when you can't watch that

906
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,140
Yeah, I should've put it together

907
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,140
Oh, no, how it's gonna help

908
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,140
Oh, and you're gonna give me a hug when you can't help

909
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,140
Oh, and you're gonna give me a hug

910
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,140
Oh, and you're gonna give me a hug

911
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,140
Yeah, you're gonna give me a hug when you can't watch

912
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,140
Yeah, you're gonna give me a hug when you can't watch

913
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,140
Yeah, you're gonna give me a hug when you can't watch

914
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,140
Yeah, Jersey Jones

915
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,140
Indeed, from the Float Sigma music network

916
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,140
Hey Todd, you're done hearth that she's phenomenally cute

917
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,140
Excellent, show notes, of course, so we're linked to that song on the P

918
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,780
So we're linked to that song on the P. M. N. In the show notes of DailySourceCode.com.

919
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,620
Is your computer a hacker magnet?

920
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,620
It won't be anymore because Earth Link is here to save the day.

921
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:36,580
With Donald's faster than speeding bullet and firewall, it is more powerful than a locomotive.

922
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:43,140
It has an anti-virus system that cleanses your PC with the click of a mouse.

923
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,060
It's a bird!

924
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,260
It's a plane!

925
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,620
It's Earth Link!

926
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,780
Perfect internet from outer space.

927
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,580
Link to Earth with powers and abilities far greater than those of normal high speed.

928
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,020
And price is so low that it will blow you out of this world.

929
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,860
So make the right decision and turn to Earth Link as your internet provider.

930
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,020
I've been Hawking that B.G. Blasho that Christina,

931
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,500
Martina and Schmeer doing. I got some awesome news.

932
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,140
Their sponsor just extended after only I think two episodes. The sponsor extended and said

933
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:25,220
we're going to do a year and a half for this. I think 16 or 18 months that they're going to do.

934
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:32,020
That's fantastic. Again, Potio Proud to show the young generation the value of capitalists.

935
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,060
If I can't flex, I can't flex.

936
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,780
All right, everybody, out of PotioShow.com, dailysourceco.com for your show notes.

937
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,020
Beyond the lookout at B.T. Potio.com for some interesting stuff happening.

938
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,300
Starting this afternoon, UK time and starting tomorrow afternoon as well.

939
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,500
We will turn it off at some point, I guess. All the way through the digital music awards.

940
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,460
Beyond the lookout for some interesting stars, some pretty cool people, and hopefully just some fun.

941
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,460
And just let's call it raw fun. Take care, everybody. Bye-bye.
