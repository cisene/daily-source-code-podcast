The Daily Source Code is on.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,280
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,360
I say it's you again.

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,320
Almost to lovely.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
You want to grow from my friend.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,480
What you said, you say goodbye.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,080
Should try and prove you right.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,960
Was I wrong?

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Tell me how long it's gone wrong.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,760
And I thought that you're wrong.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,600
You're done if I'm wrong.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,760
I thought that you'd be wrong.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,160
Go.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,400
Almost to right.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Maybe you've been there.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,600
Maybe you've been there.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
Maybe you know.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Maybe you know.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
Here's a spreadsheet.

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Maybe you've been breastfeeding.

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,200
Looks like a hole.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,600
And you never said it was a pleasure

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,000
when I served with it just so I think it works well in the party.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you're repressing to myself and I tell this remote,

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm done to have that touch up on this show.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
No, I know the Lord hears the Lord.

41
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,600
I hate my enemy.

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:44,240
Oh, Mr. Lovely.

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll say yes to you again.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:58,400
You want to grow from my friend where you're at.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
There's a window in my yard and can't wait.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
There's a slave in the morning.

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
There's a sworn in the rain.

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
There's no sin in the rain.

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
There's no love in the day.

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
There's no love in the day.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
There's no love in the day.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm okay.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
That one in your morning pipe, huh?

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Week of the daily source code, everybody.

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
How are you doing?

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Coming to you from a kind of a muggy, uh,

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
affluent suburb of Surrey, uh,

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
known as Gilford in the UK, um, from the Curry Cottage.

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Yeah, you can hear the fan of the background.

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Just trying to keep the air circulated.

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Wow, hope you had a good weekend.

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
I certainly had a restful one.

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
It was our 18th, um, 18th anniversary on Saturday,

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
which we don't really celebrate anniversary.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
In fact, um, uh, we've actually both forgotten at once or twice.

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Um, so it's more like, uh, you know, like a card exchange or some horrible flowers from, uh,

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
from the gas station.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Which is exactly what I got her on my way back from flying, uh,

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
uh, all of a sudden, um, Patricia felt that the 18 was an important number.

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
And we should have celebrated 18.

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Of course, she said that one day later,

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
and so I guess we'll make up for that, uh,

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
sometime during the week.

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Oh, hey, uh,

75
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
um, hey, learn something really, um, interesting over the weekend.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
I learned how to fly without my air speed indicator.

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Those of you who are pilots are going,

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
really, yeah, here's what happened.

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
The air speed indicator basically tells you what your air speed is, obviously.

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
And it's a pretty critical piece of equipment, um,

81
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
mainly for landing because, um,

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
every aircraft has a stall speed,

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
which means if you go below, um,

84
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
that particular speed at the particular settings that you have with flaps, etc.

85
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Uh, the aircraft will actually just fall out of the sky.

86
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
So you kind of need to know, you know,

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
what your, what your speed is.

88
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
And also, you don't want to,

89
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
arrive too fast because, well,

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
the plane will want to keep on flying and, uh,

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
you'll need a lot more runway to slow it down.

92
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Uh, so upon take off, um,

93
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
and, uh,

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
uh, this was, uh, for a trip to, uh,

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
just a quick flight, uh,

96
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
uh, over the channel and back,

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
just to drop off some letters in, uh,

98
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,400
the most expensive, uh, postman there is, uh,

99
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
uh, upon take off, uh,

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I saw that the air speed indicator had failed.

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Um, now Captain Dan was with me.

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I have to, I have to say that.

103
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
And so what should we do?

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Shall we abort? He says, no, this is good exercise.

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Uh, so, um, we pulled up and, uh,

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
off we were, uh, although, you know,

107
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
we did a couple of circuits see if, uh,

108
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
if the thing would come unglued or whatever.

109
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
This thing, there's no real mechanics to it.

110
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
It's all kind of, uh,

111
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
system, so it's almost impossible for anything to fail on it.

112
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Um, I guess, is there any electronics?

113
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Uh, yeah.

114
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Well, in essence, there's no mechanical things that could really go that wrong.

115
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
So, um, so there's nothing to let's,

116
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
let's do a landing without the air speed indicator.

117
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
So of course, you know, I came in faster than

118
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I should have, obviously, because I'm, you know,

119
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
uh, worried about going too slow and falling out of the sky.

120
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
But, you know, but set her down,

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
made the landing smoke the tire a little bit.

122
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I have a, I have a little square spot on my left, uh,

123
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I'm a left tire and then, uh,

124
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
we decided we could go figure it out, uh,

125
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
uh, later and we could just fly without it.

126
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Um, now what typically happens is so stupid.

127
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
What typically happens when your air speed indicator doesn't work is because

128
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
there's this tube that sticks out underneath the wing.

129
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
You'll see this on on commercial airlines as well.

130
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
They look like, um,

131
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,400
almost like with little machine gun turns sticking out with

132
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
a little hole in it.

133
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
That's called the Pito tube and the way it measures your air speed is

134
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
by literally the air that, uh, that you're flying through gets

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
jammed into this thing.

136
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
And then, you know, the pressure that's jammed, uh,

137
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
into that tube will make this, this needle indicate the,

138
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
the true indicated air speed.

139
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
So sometimes a bug can crawl in there,

140
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
particularly if it's been around for three weeks,

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
and I didn't have a little, um,

142
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
red Pito tube cover on it, which, of course,

143
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
now I do have.

144
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
So the only thing I do is really suck it and try and suck

145
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
whatever's in, suck it out.

146
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Ah, yes.

147
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
There were quite a few laughs as I stood there

148
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
underneath the wing of my Cessna 182RG,

149
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
sucking furiously on the Pito tube.

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Comments were made for sure.

152
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
As it turns out, actually, um, uh,

153
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
the needle was stuck.

154
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Um, remember the last landing I did with Patricia,

155
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,400
which was wasn't beautiful, but was kind of a little bumpy.

156
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Somehow the needle had gotten stuck on that.

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
And so when we were actually in our way back,

158
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,400
and I just knocked on the glass about the six o'clock position,

159
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
the needle came alive and it was working.

160
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
So good.

161
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
That means I can fly a solo this week and, uh,

162
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
get some more landing practice in.

163
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
See if I can keep my tires, uh,

164
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
uh, a lifespan a little bit longer than what it is now.

165
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Lots of stuff to do today.

166
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Got a whole mess of comments.

167
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Patricia's really busy going back and forth to the vet,

168
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
and she's got stuff lined up.

169
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,400
We have to go check out this place where Christina's going to have her.

170
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Sweet 16 party on the 27th.

171
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
So, um, she's,

172
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
a little too busy to join the show today,

173
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
but she's assured me she'll be back tomorrow.

174
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
And if you want to hear more about sweet 16 parties,

175
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Christina just released a new episode of Podsave the Queen episode number six.

176
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
She talks about it, uh,

177
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,400
in detail, particularly about the MTV, uh,

178
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
television version of my fabulous,

179
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
or was it my sensational sweet 16?

180
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Uh, that's over at podsavetheQueen.podshow.com

181
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
or podsavetheQueen.com.

182
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Yes, it's a long distance dedication.

183
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
You.

184
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I.

185
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Real.

186
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I'm.

187
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Adam Currie, what's up, man?

188
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
It's a boy AB from crowcrackradio.com

189
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
We just want to let you know

190
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,400
that we just posted a show all about the only her.

191
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Ashley songs about the only her.

192
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Anyway, man, it's dedicated to you

193
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,400
and all the other folks working hard out there

194
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,580
out there to post this podcast movement for it is appreciated and we just wanted to

195
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,580
get this little shout out. All right, peace.

196
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,420
Right on A. B. Thank you. You know, we're doing a little test on podshow.com, testing out

197
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,140
the network effect of our network, which is exactly what we built for listeners, trying

198
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,100
to get the best stuff to listeners, trying to turn listeners on to cool things to

199
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,140
explore and participate in shows. And so one of the pieces of content that we've invested

200
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:25,460
in a podshow is a production that podshow LA is making called Shadow Falls. It's an original

201
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:33,540
drama series, audio drama, we're reviving an art that barely barely still exists on, well,

202
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,060
the BBC still does audio dramas, but it's something really from the past, but with today's

203
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,960
technology and the amount of talent floating around that is willing to work and just do

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,500
something creative. I'm just amazed at the result and really, really pleased with the response

205
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:00,740
to it. Excuse me, this sincere moment, brought you by Shadow Falls at Shadow Falls.podshow.com.

206
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:08,940
So part of the test that we're doing is involves the homepage at Podshow, where now in

207
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,300
the flash that starts up right there and there's always new stuff in the program guide there

208
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:20,660
in the flash opening montage. We're promoting Shadow Falls there under the music tab where, of

209
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:27,500
course, promoting monk with IAM, which is Molly's theme from Shadow Falls for the closing credits.

210
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,780
And we've also inserted these very short, yeah, little promo plugs from some of the podcasters

211
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:39,820
around the network, which is actually our first network-wide D-Gap insertion campaign, if you

212
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,140
will. So every single show that's on the podcast, on the podshow podcast network, using

213
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,660
the PDN, the delivery network, has a little short blip up front sometime. Was it soccer

214
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,740
girl, did one? Cali, did one? Creepy Sleepy Show, did one? We have the regular trailer, all

215
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,180
in rotation, and they just fire up right before the actual podcast that you requested if it's

216
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,340
on our network that is, and it's really working the numbers doubled in two days. I'm so

217
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,540
of so pleased with this. This is the stuff that I've been dreaming of, to be able to put stuff

218
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:21,100
into the network and make stuff grow, and it's just happening. Yeah, please, very cool.

219
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Let's see. Hey, today we've got to announce the winner of the Troy Wantsen iPod contest.

220
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,140
Now, of course, this all started off with Troy, needing an iPod, who registered a

221
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,820
main name called Troy needs an iPod.com and he was soliciting donations and I picked up on it

222
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,100
and I said, well, it's certainly we can do better with that. And tied into the DSC promo code

223
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,180
you use on checkout at godaddy.com. And a lot of entries, all of them posted in comments at daily

224
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,940
source code.com, which is pretty much where I'd like you to go if you have anything to say about

225
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,940
the show. And it was very hard choosing a winner. Now, of course, you know, I'm the soul judge

226
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:06,140
and Voidware privated by law, etc. But I had a couple of basic criteria. First of all,

227
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,500
it had to be a domain name that, you know, kind of, you know, the actual name itself had

228
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,740
to strike a chord. I guess I was looking for humor more than anything. And extra points, if it

229
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,500
actually was registered, it didn't even have to be registered with a daily source code,

230
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,100
check out code or even godaddy for that matter. But it did actually have to be registered

231
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,060
and extra points, if you point it towards a fun domain. And it was very, very hard. I mean,

232
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,220
I would have loved to give in everyone and I've got participated. And this is a pretty ad hoc

233
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:46,380
thing. It's coming out of my own personal pod show production budget. So it's not like a

234
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,100
network wide thing, but I really appreciate all the participation. And I think that the one that

235
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:02,060
I like the best is, I don't even know who the hell posted this whole on a second. This is actually

236
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:12,060
it is a person with a pod show plus account, MZ Marty pants, MZ Marty pants. Here's the URL

237
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,060
that I liked. It's a domain name. I have a goddamn shuffle and I'm a cheap whore who wants to

238
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:26,700
promote other podcast.com, which by itself was pretty funny. But it points to what is it transadvocate.com

239
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:33,820
slash scrunch my poop, which is this whole site that he built about folding, folding and scrunching.

240
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:45,260
And don't hate me because I'm hoaring for an iPod to hate me because I'm a scruncher.

241
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:55,740
So let me see if I can find out who this actually is. How well there's a fantastic, a fantastic

242
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:02,540
banner as well on this site. So I'm going to get the info on MZ Marty pants. You just want

243
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,540
yourself an iPod. Congratulations. Maybe it's just the mood out. The mood I was in over the

244
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:16,300
weekend, but it really caught my fancy. And here by we close the entire Troy needs an iPod contest.

245
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,060
More contest coming soon for sure, because we got some great sponsors and advertisers who are

246
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:30,780
coming in with some very creative ideas. Stay tuned for that. Rishab Kumar says, hey Adam,

247
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,940
I love emails like this. Well, I was taking a dump in the bathroom today and idea dawned upon me,

248
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,100
instead of having rolls of toilet paper, why not have pre-folded toilet paper? We could make a

249
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,100
little machine that would fit in the toilet paper roll area. And when you took one pre-folded sheet,

250
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,340
another one would pop up. I bet there's some money in this business, Mr. Curry. Your thoughts?

251
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,220
This is Shubi, of course, from the Shubi show. Hey, Shubi, I love the entrepreneurial spirit,

252
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,780
dude. And actually, I love thinking about an infrastructure like that and how it can be used differently.

253
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,100
I mean, there's some very successful stories of people who reinvented things like the vacuum cleaner.

254
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,180
Can we actually reinvent the toilet paper roll? Think about how many toilet paper rolls and

255
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,340
toilet paper roll attachments there are in the world. It could be a huge opportunity.

256
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,420
Flesh it out a little bit and send me a business plan. Hey, Adam says a Tom Rock hold.

257
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:26,060
I'm one show away from episode 100 on bucket drive time. It would be most excellent to get

258
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,220
a quick mention on the Charlie that I can then lift and put into the show.

259
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,860
Thanks for the positive music network. Without it, there would be no bucket drive time podcast.

260
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,540
All right, congratulations, dude. 100 episodes. Very cool. Although I think we should stop celebrating

261
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,740
all these, you know, you can do a, you can do one at 50 at 100 at 150, you know, 200,

262
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:51,180
500 to 1000. And quite honestly, I want to stop with a numbers at a certain point. I mean,

263
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,820
how high am I going to have to count? Do we, will we actually wind up with one day daily source

264
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:03,820
code episode 10,397 seems like a bit of overkill to me? Your thoughts would be appreciated.

265
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,020
Just a quick thing that I'll put in a link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com. Did you see

266
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:17,100
this roiter's picture of, I think it's a, they root and this was going around the internet quite

267
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,940
a bit over the weekend. It's just in case you hadn't seen it, you have to see that this, uh,

268
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,940
I think it was in a roiter's photographer, or probably a freelance photographer who sold the picture

269
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,460
to roiter's doctor the photo. And it's not the first time he's been suspected of doctoring photos,

270
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:38,060
but he literally used the Photoshop clone tool and made the, the black smoke coming from shell,

271
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,820
department buildings, twice as bad, even darker than the original photo. You know, this is just

272
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,140
and of course, you know how this worked out, right? The guy needs to sell a picture. So he wants to

273
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,620
sell the really gruesome picture to roiter's and there's something that going, what's, what's gruesome?

274
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,900
This is not enough smoke. Can you know, yeah, that one. That's a good. Oh, wait, maybe I have some

275
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,180
with some more smoke. I'll get right back to you. You know, this is how the war is being reported to

276
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:08,300
you, my friends. Enjoy mainstream media, please. There's definitely other places and other sources.

277
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,380
You can get a heck of a lot more information about what's really happening over there. Hey, out of this

278
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:20,060
philosophy guy on DSC 435, you had mentioned that you wanted to know a little bit more about

279
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:28,780
your audience. Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm a typical DSC listener, but I'm 42. I married

280
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:37,260
had three kids, have a computer programmer from Milwaukee and I've been a podcaster for about a

281
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,300
year. You know, I got to say that all the people who've been calling in with kind of their

282
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,700
listener profile and I'll be highlighting one later on in the show today. As I promised, you know,

283
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,940
we've got got to make these t-shirts. I don't even know what the heck is going to be on the t-shirt.

284
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,420
Yeah, let's come with a good slogan for it and I'll have them made up, but I just love hearing,

285
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:02,140
you know, your profile who you are, where you are, how old you are, what you do. You know,

286
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,380
stuff like if you married or not. And of course, if you're a folder or a scruncher, that is

287
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:14,140
critical, that is really the scientific portion of the of the survey. And once I get the t-shirts in,

288
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,300
once we figure out what the slogan is going to be, I want to have a featured listener of the day. I

289
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,100
already have a featured listener of the day for every day this week. So retroactively these folks

290
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,580
will get t-shirts. Also got to figure out how to find out who you are after you've called in.

291
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,980
And then I still need a mattress to send you stuff. But I did want to ask you a question.

292
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:40,700
What was the logic in Pod Show Plus that you used to determine the similar shows and related

293
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,660
feeds that show up as part of the Pod Show Plus page for particular Podcast?

294
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:54,860
Yeah, I think I think we took an idiot pill on that one. That definitely makes no sense. And if you

295
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,100
haven't seen Pod Show Plus, go to any Podcast on Pod Show Plus. And you'll see that there's a box,

296
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,500
there's fans, and there's another little box that says related feeds. And it makes no sense.

297
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,100
What is a feed? Is it a show? Is it a channel? That's going to change. I think it should be

298
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,340
related shows. But it could also be related channels, which I'm, you know, I think is probably

299
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,220
even smarter because how do you come up with related shows? You know, we have some recommendation

300
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,220
engine, you know, four out of five dentists subscribed to this Podcast. Therefore you might

301
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,900
like this one. I don't like that at all. That seems, that's never worked for me at least.

302
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,140
However, I do see if someone makes a channel on Pod Show Plus and has a certain show in it

303
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,260
that you may be interested in other channels that contain that show created by other people.

304
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,140
That I think would have some value. So I think that's where it's going to go. And so we'll

305
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,260
probably say related channels. If you let me know that would be great. Yeah, you got it.

306
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,900
And here's the obligatory plug. Of course. You can listen to me, the philosophy guy.

307
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:04,780
Either one of these podcasts, the philosophy guy show at philosophy guy.net or the

308
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,380
Podsafe Comedy Countdown at PodsafeComedyCountdown.com.

309
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,660
And Adam. Yes. Well, this call complete. Holder scruncher, holder scruncher.

310
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:22,140
I'm a scruncher. Yeah. There are no secrets. Only information you don't yet have.

I've carried on the world. I just help you, but I'm just a girl.

317

Oh, love me tonight and let me feel love. I'm just a girl.

318

Oh, love me tonight and let me feel love.

319
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:26,300
Oh, love me tonight and let me feel love.

320
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:36,300
Oh, love me tonight and let me feel love.

321
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Oh, love me tonight and let me feel love.

322
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:45,340
So, Sofia Ramos, love me tonight. You can find her at the Pod Same Music Network links to that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

323
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:51,980
Those of you checking us out on Serious Stars 102 coming up next, Pacific Coast Hellway, followed by Dawn and Drew Jersey Todd Show,

324
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,300
DVD Weekly, CC Chaping, East Radio, and Scott Sigurdall talked to you guys tomorrow.

325
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:04,060
Hi, Adam and DSE listeners, Ed from Ed's Mixbag here. I just wanted to send the biggest thank you I could to Adam.

326
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,900
The promo you played on DSE number 435 inside of the satellite window, no less,

327
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,100
was put together at the very last minute on Thursday at 5 p.m. East Coast Time and then

328
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:22,380
dropped it into your inbox at Pod Show, probably around 4 a.m. Friday your time. As I don't like doing stuff at the last minute,

329
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,260
you're playing it on the show made it even more special. As I drove to Denny's for breakfast,

330
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:33,180
I figured I'd miss the deadline for the Charlie. During breakfast, I popped my iPods ear buds into my ears,

331
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,660
and 14 minutes later had a grin so wide I felt like I had to tell everyone on the restaurant

332
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,340
my promo on behalf of Sofia Ramos made it to the show. This definitely made up for the previous time

333
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,860
I ate there, and I listened to you and Patricia discuss which category we fall into folder or

334
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:55,740
cruncher. That took care of the appetite on that time, but not so today. You've outdone yourself my friend,

335
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,980
but then something else happened. I proceeded to the car wash and a stop at my local grocery store.

336
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,700
The ride from their home is a short one, so I popped the earbuds back into my ears,

337
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,900
something I don't usually do while driving. And as I got home to my condos parking lot,

338
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,940
there was this beautiful lady unloading the trunk of her car. It wasn't a red sports car,

339
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,780
but as I listened to you, closed out the Charlie. It was as if you were narrating everything I was

340
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:28,060
seeing through my windshield. The first thing I heard you say was, I think it was you were referring

341
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,860
to the song you had played just prior to that. And you said if I had one of those every month, I'd be happy.

342
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:39,500
Uncanny to say the least what I was seeing here for the listeners. This is what I heard from

343
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,140
Adam while I was drooling at a blonde neighbor that I had never seen before.

344
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,460
And you can see from miles and miles and miles, but not really, there is a cloud day, so I'm like,

345
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:57,100
oh, there's the hot look in the neighbor. We have a neighbor and she's an aerobics instructor,

346
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,460
and she has a hot red sports car, and Patricia's always a bag in honor. Oh, man, I wish Patricia

347
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,500
were here. We could talk about her right now because she always has a belly shirts on.

348
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,820
Yeah, let's see. She just pulled up into the drive and her little red sports car. Let me see

349
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,900
which is wearing all of it. And as I walked up to my door, the narration continued,

350
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:22,060
giving me a cause to chuckle. Some comic relief as I face preparing more for the upcoming

351
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:29,420
Sophia Ramus special on Ed's mixed bag available as of this past Saturday, August 5th. By the way,

352
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,620
as I follow up on August 12th, I'll have a Skype interview with the rock goddess that will not

353
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,660
rehash any questions we've all heard before. I have a unique angle, I think,

354
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:45,420
having grown up in Brooklyn, New York and Ramus in the Bronx, New York. That should I'm hoping

355
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:50,620
create sort of a rapport with Sophia. I haven't done the interview yet, so wish us luck.

356
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:59,340
The URL is edzmixbag.com, and your support item is very much appreciated. And, uh, oh yeah,

357
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,820
yeah, bolder. Yeah, of course. Of course you're folding my friend. It's a scruncher, not cruncher.

358
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,540
But as you were telling me that story, I thought back to the many podcasts that I've heard

359
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,980
that somehow strangely interacted with the surroundings I was in at the time, and I think I've

360
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,060
got the, I think I've got the new slogan. Now, it's a stolen one, of course, but all, you know,

361
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:26,460
it's better to steal something good than to make up something bad. Potio, the soundtrack to your life.

362
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:36,700
Another, the topic of folder versus scruncher has officially been closed, but it gave rise in my mind

363
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:44,540
to an issue which I feel is the number one health issue facing men today. You see, many men just

364
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:53,100
like you and myself suffer a terrible, painful issue, because of societal pressures and stereotypes

365
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:01,260
and embarrassment, they're afraid to talk about it. You see, I, among millions of other men in America,

366
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,300
I'm a sufferer of hemorrhoids, and I'm coming to you under the conditions of anonymity because

367
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:15,100
of those societal pressures, stereotypes, and the embarrassment. The embarrassment I'm having to

368
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:23,420
buy special creams, taking extra fiber in our diets, Adam, it's time we talk about hemorrhoids.

369
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,420
It's time that the daily source code become a beacon of light to an area that is so dark.

370
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:38,300
Adam, please help me in raising hemorrhoidal awareness and smashing down the embarrassment

371
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:45,420
that's so many men face today. Let's talk about hemorrhoids together. We can wipe out hemorrhoids.

372
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,820
Oh yeah, and I almost forgot. Folder. Well, of course, you're a folder. You kidding me? You can't

373
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,020
scrunch in that condition, my friend. But maybe you want to send this over to a mad wine scene

374
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,420
who, of course, has been fighting yeast for years. I think she could easily attack on some

375
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,140
rides. Are you troubled by nagging itch between the ears that in your ear,

376
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,820
dribble that cute tips and drive time hosts just don't seem to clear up? You may be experiencing

377
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:19,500
BMS planned media syndrome. True BMS does not respond to quick channel changes nor earplugs

378
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,140
without proper care. BMS can lead ultimately to shrinkage of the brain among other things.

379
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:31,100
However, thanks to the makers of InsightWorks.com, a revolutionary new diet has just been shown

380
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:38,540
to permanently cure BMS. A steady low fat high content diet of podcasts combined with

381
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,500
show notes comments feedback and forums has been shown to increase cognitive functioning humor,

382
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,660
co-tour, and overall satisfaction. Dry new podcasting for that. Oh, so refreshing and soothing

383
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:56,780
relief from BMS. Contact your doctor for everything else, but listen to podcasts for instant relief.

384
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,060
Brought to you by makers of InsightWorks.com and other fine podcast. Some side effects may include

385
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,300
constant walking around with earbuds, jammed into your ear and loss of all contact with the

386
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:12,300
outside world. I've been talking to a couple of big-name artists who are considering

387
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:21,100
managing a channel on pod show plus. So it would really be a whole channel about them and

388
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,100
their community. And I can't tell you, I just can't talk about it yet because it's too

389
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:33,500
premature and I want to mess it up. But it does have to do with pod safe music, obviously,

390
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,300
or music that could become pod safe. And really, as I said, an entire channel, go look at the

391
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,380
program guide at pod show plus and then imagine what a channel could look like by single

392
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,620
artist. And it may not necessarily be an artist who sings. I'm not going to give you any hints,

393
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:54,460
but we're working on a couple of different things. And I have to say that people are doing such

394
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:01,580
innovative daring and explorative things with pod safe music. It just blows me away. Check out

395
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,380
what's happening with the Jonathan culture. It's kind of the Jonathan Colton project. I mean,

396
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,020
a huge Jonathan Colton family, which is why I started the Jonathan Colton project, which is a video

397
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:17,020
podcast. It made videos for Johnson Colton songs. As if that wasn't enough, I've now decided to

398
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:22,780
fire Jonathan Colton over to the UK to form two gigs between November 10th and November 18th.

399
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,620
I've had some interest from senior universities, but I've still got a long way to go to make

400
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,100
the survival plan. So if there's anyone out there that like to help in any way, ideally I'm

401
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,500
looking to be able to help with venues and publicity, but general assistance will be appreciated.

402
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:43,980
To find out more, visit www.jo.co.com and press the tour button. And Adam, thanks for the

403
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,260
fun Javie's story. Oh, I don't want to forgot. Yeah. Oh, we got it. Fold it. No, I was the

404
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,260
one. There wasn't a time team. There's no alternative of course.

405
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:02,140
So if you want to help Jonathan Colton out with a Joc, video.com, it's cool man. He's flying him over

406
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:09,100
to do dates and they haven't even been set up yet. This is awesome. I just love how people

407
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:14,860
get involved with the artists at a ground level. This is what Christina was talking about.

408
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,940
I'm pod save the queen. She said, it was funny. She's saying, this is just like the 60s, man.

409
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Everyone can put their stuff up on my space. Of course, I crunched and cringed and said,

410
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:32,060
oh, I dream of the day when she says, you can put it all up on the pod save music network. She didn't

411
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,620
listen to me. All right. I got about seven or eight minutes. I just wanted to run through a

412
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,340
couple of different voicemails that those of you that called in over the weekend had another

413
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:49,340
30. So I can only roll out seven or eight of them. And of course, I chose the listener of the day.

414
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,620
And also a model, let me give an example of what I'd like to hear, a model listener who calls in

415
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:02,380
and does the perfect call in explaining who they are and and well, I have a listen, check it out for a second.

416
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:09,180
Hey, Adam, I'm just calling up down. You wanted to know about your listeners. The game is Brian

417
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:15,740
Plansky. I'm 31 other than Edders Pennsylvania, which is right outside of Harrisburg, the state capital.

418
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,780
I'm a new dad with the son at home. He's four months old. I work at a health desk for the

419
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:29,660
probation board for the state of Pennsylvania. I do have a podcast that I don't think

420
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:36,300
more than a handful of people listen to. It's the bulk of see her podcast at

421
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:45,500
full-to-sever.logspot.com. I am a folder and I listen to your show. You can't try the first podcast I

422
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:53,180
ever listen to and I've just been hooked on podcasting ever since. So I'm just telling all my friends about it.

423
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:00,140
Oftentimes they look at me like I'm not. She thought I'm doing the podcast. I love it.

424
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,700
Hope in the here. I'm more cool stuff from you guys. See you later.

425
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,460
See, almost almost perfect. Isn't it gave me the folder scruncher info told me what he does,

426
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,420
how old he is and what I'd love to know dude is those friends who look at you like you're nuts.

427
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,900
Show on podshow.com and then tell me if they understood any of it, if they got anywhere, if they could

428
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,340
figure it out, if they were delighted or if they didn't give a shit. Either way, I'd love to know.

429
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:33,420
Please, let me know. Hi there. My name is Kent. I'm 37. I'm a copilot at a major airline and I live in

430
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:42,060
New Hampshire. It listening since October 2004 and who has time to fold. Spencer.

431
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:51,340
Disappointing. Disappointing. I should give you the number to call and I really appreciate it.

432
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,980
I'm learning so much about you guys. The age range is all over the place too, which is just fantastic.

433
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,260
It's grab your phone now, put it in first hit little plus, which is somewhere down the bottom

434
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:08,700
of your keypad. One, two, zero, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven or in London,

435
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:16,940
O2O, 76813753. Hey, pod father. This is Greg. A couple of things, so this will be a long

436
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:24,300
message. First of all, you ask listeners to call in and say the age and stuff like that. Well,

437
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:32,220
my name is Greg. I'm 18 and I don't have a job right now, but I'm doing podcasting and what's kind

438
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:40,220
of funny about that is I never knew I could love anything so much as to getting on a little

439
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:47,580
penny microphone, a $20 microphone, I'm spilling my heart in my soul and all my funny, horrible,

440
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,860
30 little stories about fat people like grocery stores and different stuff like that.

441
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,820
It's creative, though, isn't it? Isn't it fun to do that to create a show? This is what I like

442
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:02,300
hearing as people who are just fans of podcasting listen to the favorite shows and they start

443
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,460
their own little show and it's made for just for their families or for just preventing or whatever.

444
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:12,700
It's real simple and it's free. But the other thing is, you're talking about that. You're going

445
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,900
to give out special t-shirts. Well, that sounds awesome that really does, but on a t-shirt where

446
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:24,380
it's as listener in the day or the week, it should mark folder or scruncher. And I ask my mom

447
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,100
you tell me that she wanted to know if she was a folder scruncher. She was way too embarrassed to

448
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:36,140
call, but she, indeed, is a scruncher folder, so two scrunchers and a family. And honestly,

449
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:42,380
I really, really don't want to know what my father is and a few of the scruncher are not.

450
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,980
I think he uses their fingers really too much. And the other thing is, well, okay, you've been

451
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,420
telling people to go over the daily source code.com to leave their entries for your iPod. Well,

452
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,700
I went over there and there's like nowhere to enter for your iPod. I don't freaking understand.

453
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,260
Oh, dude. If you just go into any into the episode, this comments right below.

454
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,020
I'd love to find out why people can't figure that stuff out. We got to make this better.

455
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,300
Got to make it better. Yeah, just, just, did you read the comments? Did you find the

456
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,300
comments at all that had people like entering the Troy News and iPod.com contest?

457
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,660
I tried to message a couple of different people and they don't know where the hell they're going to

458
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:26,300
language. And by the way, Shadow Falls, the best podcast ever. But, you know, you can't tell

459
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,660
about it. That because they're going to kill me. And the other thing is, well, that's at the end where

460
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,420
it says, this has been another pod save pod gas, a pod show pod gas, speaking your ears and

461
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,980
goes, I love it. The fact, Dawn, I want to know, please tell me for the love of, for the love of

462
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,540
zombie Jesus. Is that Dawn the Sally at the end where it says, why why it is? Okay, it says,

463
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:58,140
limelight, not long with limelight, limelight. No, it's not Dawn the Sally. I do know who it is.

464
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,020
I wonder if we should make another contest out of this. Okay, I think we should. I'll think of a

465
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:13,900
prize. I'll make it worth your while. Who is the female voice? At the end of every pod show pod

466
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:19,580
cast where you hear, get this show and other great shows like it on the high performance pod cast

467
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:27,420
delivery network from pod show and limelight networks. And then you hear, I love it. Who is it? Who is that

468
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,940
mysterious female voice? If you guess, fame and riches and valuable prizes for you. It says, I

469
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,460
want. Because it's so, I think I'm a super genius that I taught that and realize that.

470
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:46,300
Yep, that's about it. You know what? I love the Charlie. It was that French guy. I forgot his name

471
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,380
right now. French French lazy bastard. That's the awesome thing you get to do in any of the

472
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:56,380
of them. That's not it. What do you mean, come extra blogger? Today, what I'm not sure if

473
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:03,100
I say on London. One more thing, you have to frequently think about coming to the podcast

474
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,740
episode because I really wanted to go there just so I can meet you, pod father. Because you've

475
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:14,780
done so much for test pod cast. That's the only reason I wanted to go. And I went to the last

476
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,780
year and I couldn't get to because there's just so many people, but please seriously think about it.

477
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:25,740
Okay. And if not, I would dare, you know, bye. All right. Okay, now we learned a lot in that one

478
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:31,580
didn't we? New contest started. Who is that female voice? Diable cash prizes. Well, maybe not cash,

479
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:38,300
but a valuable prize. I promise you that. Pod cast the expo. I don't know I did. I really don't

480
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:46,940
know. I'm going to see if the timing works out. And then if I go, then it'll be, if I go, then it'll

481
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,340
be, we'll probably have to get another hotel suite. Because it's just like, there's nothing,

482
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,140
you know, I walked two steps and there's a million people and no one's ever happy because

483
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,460
either I didn't talk to you where I talked to you for three seconds. I hate that. I hate it.

484
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,300
So that would be the only condition that I could go, but it really depends on the timing. And then of course,

485
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:10,460
we'll make sure that we hook up for sure. Hey Adam, this is Mark and Austin Texas. I just wanted to let's

486
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:19,580
know that I really like the channel feature on the Pod Show Plus. Making a channel for my device is great.

487
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:26,780
And the cool thing about it is that it actually, uh, let's me add everything to my playlist all

488
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:33,180
once. I don't have to go dig it around and everything that ad shows to play us. You just add

489
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:40,860
everything in the channel directory and you're good to go. Well, anyway, that's all I wanted to say.

490
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:49,660
And if anyone has a chance to take a listen to a tasty logic at tastylogic.podshow.com,

491
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:56,620
that is all. That folder scruncher. Too bad. Dude, you figured it out. This is this is one of

492
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:02,540
the things that we're going to be using channels for. So imagine using the same interface and just

493
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,580
by dragging and dropping as you've probably already figured out to be able to program, not just

494
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:14,940
what goes on your iPod, but what goes on to your Tivo or perhaps if you're in the United Kingdom,

495
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,220
what goes on to your it's a big expensive word, IPTV, which is something we'll see all over the world,

496
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,580
which of course is television that comes in through an internet protocol or better known as

497
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:33,180
broadband. And then no one's here to answer the phone. Oh, maybe Christina is here.

498
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,380
So indeed, so you'll be able to sit at, you know, you can sit at the, you can actually make another

499
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,540
channel for when I'm sitting at the office and just play that in a web browser. So you're going to be

500
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,260
able to configure these channels in any number of ways you could do it by genre or you could do it

501
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,300
by device that you want to play it out on. Exactly right, glad you just glad you saw it and glad that

502
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:59,020
you are like it. And now we're from our sponsor. It's the Yanks versus the Brits. We'll drive

503
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:05,420
it, show the crazy, but everybody knows that it's apparent to see that just like you and me,

504
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:13,420
it's the Yanks and the Brits. The Yanks versus the Brits. Mind the gap.

505
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:21,020
Had a my major again just filling up on the cool from last week, as a reserved

506
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:26,620
introspective, some might say tight asked Brits. There are three things that I can't bring myself

507
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:35,500
to do. One is to refer to anybody as dude. Another is to admit that I did anything,

508
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:41,180
that's with 1G or 2. And a third is to reveal my bottom wiping habit. This is a world

509
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,820
that's what you might be happy. So I guess my best adjustment here, guys,

510
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:56,940
folder. Thank you so much. All right, one last song before I get out of here, brand new to the

511
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,660
podcast music network. Lee Rocker. Rockin' Hada.

512
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:35,900
I got you tell you that the day is getting near, baby, baby, there ain't nothing left to say.

513
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,500
Baby, baby, I want you to get on where I'm looking at, and then I haven't been there before.

514
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,700
I want to want you down, feel the moon through, a baby, baby, let you know that it's true.

515
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:54,140
You told me that I'm gonna sit in a train, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,

516
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:28,780
let's jump on the car, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't you know what, feel it's true? I'm not gonna

517
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:34,780
sit in a train, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't you know what, feel it's true? I'm not gonna

518
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:41,180
sit in a train, baby, baby, don't you know what, feel it's true? I'm not gonna get on

519
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,780
this.

520
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,780
Looking at my Д we call him.

521
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:24,140
I wanna What is all the proof, baby, baby, don't you know that it's true?

522
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:30,380
We're talking now but it doesn't take, baby, baby, baby, I didn't pay.

523
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:35,380
I want to tell you that the day is continued.

524
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,380
Baby, baby, they're ain't got to let me say.

525
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,380
Baby, baby, I want to let you get away.

526
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,380
I'm not gonna let you say.

527
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,380
Baby, baby, I want to let you get away.

528
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,380
I'm not gonna let you fall.

529
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,380
We're not gonna let you fall.

530
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,380
We're not gonna let you fall.

531
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,380
The rocker, rock and harder.

532
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,380
He's branded the pot save music network.

533
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,380
The first track up there, which, and if you don't know who,

534
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,380
who Lee Rocker is, he's the bass player from the straight cats.

535
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,380
Remember the straight cats?

536
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,380
Of course, many of you probably heard of Brian Setser,

537
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,380
who I think also did, had some solo success.

538
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,380
I've thought of the straight cats.

539
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,380
And so this is the bass player.

540
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,380
And according to Patricia, he was the cute guy anyway.

541
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,380
Lady Patricia will be on with us tomorrow.

542
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,380
I guess if all goes according to plan.

543
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,380
One more thing I just wanted to check out if you have the time.

544
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,380
I told you on Friday about the strip podcast, the strip podcast.com,

545
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,380
another pod show podcast.

546
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,380
And these guys are in Vegas.

547
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,380
And so they interview all these folks who come in and perform in Vegas

548
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,380
and sometimes for weeks or months on end.

549
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,380
So the one I told you to listen to was Tony Braxton,

550
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,380
but then I went and they listened to their current show,

551
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,380
which is with Chubby Checker.

552
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,380
And you've got to listen to this show.

553
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,380
Chubby Checker is so frustrated about mainstream music

554
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,380
and mainstream media, really.

555
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,380
Because he feels that, well, as you'll hear in the interview,

556
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,380
every other sentence he says, I don't get no airplane.

557
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,380
I don't get no airplane.

558
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,380
The reason why I don't get no airplane.

559
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,380
I don't get no airplane.

560
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,380
And just goes on and on and on.

561
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,380
And he says some really valid things.

562
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,380
Like, you know, he feels that if you look in music,

563
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,380
you should say, well, in reverse chronological order,

564
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,380
the people who made it happen,

565
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,380
the Beatles, Elvis Presley and Chubby Checker.

566
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,380
And he says that actually a lot of what he did.

567
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,380
All the way up to his influence music,

568
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,380
all the way up to hip hop.

569
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,380
He says hip hop, that's just the pony.

570
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,380
Chubby Checker did that, but Chubby Checker don't get no airplane.

571
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,380
That's why no one knows about the history of Chubby Checker.

572
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,380
And I'm sitting there listening to this going like, dude.

573
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,380
And I don't know if you own any or you're stuffed,

574
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,380
but get it up on the Podsade music network.

575
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,380
Become a part of this community.

576
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,380
We'll get you some pod play for sure.

577
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,380
Look at what James Brown did.

578
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,380
You better believe it.

579
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,380
So if anyone knows good old Chubby Checker,

580
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,380
living in Pennsylvania these days, I believe.

581
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,380
He should definitely check out what's happening in podcasting.

582
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,380
I think people would give him more than the props he deserves.

583
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,380
And we'd love to be able to play your music.

584
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,380
Are you kidding me?

585
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,380
All right.

586
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,380
Wow, almost 50 minutes too long, too long, too long, too long.

587
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,380
Okay, got lots of stuff to do.

588
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,380
Looking for the crap here to the lighter.

589
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,380
Can't sign off without that.

590
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,380
