00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000

Delta Sierra Charlie 406, another sunny day in San Francisco.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I love you, big heart fag.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Even if your balls might sag.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I had a miss as your favorite purple dinosaur stopping by to tell you that I

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
want to put my fist in your ass.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm going to be in the Bay Area next week and I was hoping to binge you over a table

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and pump you harder than a Mexican oil.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Good day, good day.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's sing another song, shall we?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Adams ass feels real tight.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I could bang him day and night too.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, Adam Gurney thanks for spending time with me.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Maybe next time you can come over some afternoon for cake and crumpets

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and I can tea bag you with my big purple going first.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Good day, good day.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That would be great.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Bye bye.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
See you later.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh yeah, not entirely family say.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Transmeters?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We don't need nuss.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thinking transmeters?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Honesting is Adam Gurney.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Can't find a pulse, can't find a heartbeat.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Nobody will sense a lie.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Packin' you live with your eyes closed.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
To you tonight you're alive.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You don't want to see, you don't want to feel.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You don't want to touch you in the body.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I know you're keeping away.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In the darkness, you may as well.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Stickin' life into your heart.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You may as well.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Put a puppet in your head.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You may as well.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Send yourself on fire.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Catching things will be dead.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We'll take you, believe when you get hurt.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All right, you never love her.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
To you, if we're no don't you can.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We'll take you to this day.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't want to see, you don't want to feel.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You don't want to touch you in the body.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I know you're keeping away.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In the darkness, you may as well.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Stickin' life into your heart.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You may as well.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Put a puppet in your head.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You may as well.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Send yourself on fire.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Catching things will be dead.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You may as well.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Stickin' life into your heart.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You may as well.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Put a puppet in your head.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You may as well.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Send yourself on fire.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Catching things will be dead.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Open your eyes, breathe in the air.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Just looking around, laughs every breath.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Only once it's only one life.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't you know that you're still alive.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You don't want to see, you don't want to feel.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You don't want to touch you in the body.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I know you're keeping away.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In the darkness, you may as well.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Stickin' life into your heart.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You may as well.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Put a puppet in your head.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You may as well.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Send yourself on fire.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Catching things will be dead.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You may as well be dead.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Voice your fuel from down under.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Better off dead.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A request from my official audio library in Tom Scrooting, who lives in Australia.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a made of his.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And you can find him on the pod safe music network.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Voice your fuel.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hey, good morning, everybody.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's Monday and it's another beautiful day in San Francisco.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's going to be beautiful and warm.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No doubt about it.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How you doing?

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hope you had a great weekend.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you're dead, hope you had a great father's day.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you're not, and you still have it at, hope you gave him a great father's day.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everything good here in the condo.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It was the weekend.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't think I saw a single solitary cloud at all.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It was just so incredibly nice.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yesterday morning, I slept in a little bit.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So around 10 o'clock.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I got a, I got a text message from Martha.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Ron's wife.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And she said, I am taking the two dads out for brunch.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Dad's who's kids aren't around this father's day.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Martha and Ron's son, August in Miami.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think, and of course, I'm away from home.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So that was really nice.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Went to the Ritz Carlton and had,

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
the nice father's day brunch, which was just fantastic.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And it's so good to see that even though in this very posh,

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Schwab sophisticated hotel and everyone's, you know,

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Schwab and having a nice sophisticated brunch,

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
which was fantastic food, of course.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Really great to see that on the screen right there,

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
above the, what was the, it was above the eggs.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right above the eggs was a flat screen with,

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
with the, with the, with the football match with the soccer match.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Fantastic.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think America has finally caught on to how cool football really is.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Uh, of course, we called football when we're from Europe.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But you know, I'm talking about soccer.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
See, what I do Saturday.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Saturday, I really slept in.

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Man, I was, I was so just incredibly tired from,

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
from, I don't know, from the, from the, from life in general.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is that, is that possible?

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But anyway, got, got a rock and show lined up for you.

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Lots of feedback.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Lots of, well, thank you very much.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I have a feeling it was Mark Yoshimura Nemkoff who,

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
who was good friends and is real tight with Barney.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Appreciate that man.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's perfect way to kick off anyone they show.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000

Right on.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Speaking of all about Apple,

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think I really gave this PC a workout over the weekend.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah, I guess Saturday, a lot of time was spent.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, of course I know what I did Saturday.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, my nuts.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course I went to the, to the Valley Tab,

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
or to hang out with the Boys and Girls from Pod Show to watch the USA.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
More about that later in this show.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Lots of cool feedback from people.

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But I really gave the, the laptop a workout.

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And I got to tell you, so far it's holding up.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I haven't had any weird crashes or anything really funky happen.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've been putting it through the test.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It gets a lot less hotter than any Mac I've had.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So I should have taken the power book to the, to the genius bar on Saturday.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I am so tired of this.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think what I'll do is I'll just ask David from, from Pod Show HQ.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you can take care of it because I really don't want to see it back for a while.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You know, I'm kind of like a jilted lover.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And yes, I've got my new, my new sexy friend.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
My sexy girlfriend, the Porter J.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hey Adam, this is Rodrigo.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't think I'm on the resident enjoying the boobs test.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's you.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, this is so cool.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We had a conversation.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think it was maybe last week about when in the UK in London in particular,

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
when the weather heats up, it's just,

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
oh man, the women just, everything is, is, it's a boobfest.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, it's just a boobfest.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's a wonderful time.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Everybody's happy and it's all hanging out.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Who has been having fun in Pod Show Beta?

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But to tell you folks up there, it is good.

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I mean, both Pod Show Beta, Pod Show Plus and the boobs.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I've got a question for you.

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I've been telling you about Pod Show Plus.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And I can't wait to have them on the inside to start building up my entourage and

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
share shows with them.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But how will you be releasing Pod Show Plus?

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Will it be like Gmail or rightly by invitation only in the beginning?

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Or will it be open to everyone from the get-go?

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey, I mean, Pod is talking to her about Trinity.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let us know how she's doing.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Love what you're doing.

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Keep on casting.

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So Rodrigo is a buddy of ours who lives in London.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He's from Brazil, I believe.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Met him, by the way, when we were in London a couple weeks back.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Nice guy.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And so he's in the Pod Show Plus Beta.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Very good question.

198
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How are we going to release it?

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, I guess if you were to compare it to Gmail or rightly or anything else.

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I guess the golden tickets really is kind of how we've gotten a couple hundred people in and

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
start using the system, start banging it, start ripping it apart.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So the plan is to just open up, which is really scary.

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You know, because the minute you open up, that's it.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You know, it's your asses out there.

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And of course, a whole bunch of stuff.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know, a whole bunch of stuff is going to be wrong.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I'm going to work and people will say this and say that.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So we're just going to balls to the wall and it's coming very soon.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And it'll just open up.

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And it'll open up on all sides.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
For Pod castes, of course, the Pod cast delivery network.

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Excuse me.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Sen Seo.

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The Sen Seo moment brought to you by Digital Flotson.

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So we'll open it wide up and it's weird not far off.

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We're getting very close.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can hear more people who are in there.

218
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We've been testing it.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I like the Rodrigo is using some of the language that we're using.

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Like, I want to get more people in my entourage.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, yeah.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But even more important Rodrigo.

223
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Thank you very much for that London Boob report.

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Hey, Adam Curry.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I would just listen to your daily source code from yesterday June 60.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't want to say yay for the hot chicks and London in the summer condom.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm going to be there next week.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is the Pod chick.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I hope I can just see you.

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But I probably won't put it there.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay.

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I know that you are with me and spirit as you always are.

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Very helpful.

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you so much.

235
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And I'm pretty much about it.

236
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
My convertible in the bikini right now.

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And now I have a ball.

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm kind of that.

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Hot chicks.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Hot chicks.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No summer condom here too, baby.

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All right.

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Make them soil.

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hmm.

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Pod chick.

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, you made me smile baby.

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Lovely.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
More of that, please.

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
More UK boob feedback.

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Not a problem.

251
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You know, in the US, we have a real problem with that.

252
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Of course.

253
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because we can't be showing any of that.

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We can't even talk about it.

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can't even say the word nipple on the radio.

256
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I mean, I just think about that.

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Maybe you can say nipple on the radio now.

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Maybe since the Janet Jackson Ward drove malfunction, you are allowed to say,

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
when we are an MTV, when I was on the Royal Wii was on MTV,

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
there's no way we were, you could not say nipple.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You could say nothing, not even close.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let alone what you're about to hear.

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Something that you would never hear on terrestrial radio ever.

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This is a conversation that was recorded.

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You know, we have, you have all kinds of technology at Pod Show,

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and we have all these different satellite offices.

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Now, PW Fenton, of course, you know from digital flotsom.

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If not, you have to check out his podcast, digital flotsom.org.

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He also manages all the serious satellite production,

270
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
so that every single day there's another show for you.

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Four hour block of shows on serious satellite,

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
one-o-two.

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But somehow, while he was having a conversation,

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I think this is with Brian Know of the Frank Truth podcast,

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
which also is heard, I think once a week on stars one-o-two,

276
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
we can't play it as a podcast because it basically contains

277
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
copyrighted music from Frank Sinatra.

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And this is not your family, don't like that.

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But check out this conversation that was accidentally recorded,

280
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and I do put the emphasis on accidentally between PW and Brian.

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hey, PW, it's me, Brian.

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hey, Brian, what's going on?

283
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Dude, did you hear that Adam ran into some trouble with a training

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
out in San Francisco?

285
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, that really sucks.

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's going to cost him plenty, too.

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, it's weird that he's being so open about it.

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, I don't know why, I mean, we've all been there.

289
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So you don't think that's a little weird?

290
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why? That sort of thing has happened to me many times over the years.

291
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What's the big deal?

292
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Man, I'm so happy to hear you say that.

293
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I've been feeling like I'm the only one in the world.

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Can I share something with you?

295
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Sure.

296
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, I've got this one drawer in my dresser,

297
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and it's just filled with these really special

298
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
tetties and beautiful lingerie.

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And every now and then, I like it.

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What?

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, Granny, transmission.

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He was talking about the transmission on Trinity that went out on him.

303
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So, dude, tell me more about this lingerie.

304
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I have to go now.

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You guys have waited once time on your hands.

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We've got to find more work for you.

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Always willing and able and curious to hear your feedback.

308
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Voice mail phone line numbers.

309
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
A new jersey is 2016256357.

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Probably the best number for you if you're using Skype out since I believe it's still

311
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
still Skype out free month or whatever.

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And the new Skype.

313
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
On the PC, I have to say, is quite remarkable.

314
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The sound quality and Ron has one of these newfangled

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
VIO laptops.

316
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm kind of jealous about that.

317
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's got the built-in camera.

318
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And that shit just works right out of the box.

319
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Amazing.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Even though I don't have a camera, which is one of those things.

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Usually, if you don't both have a camera on both ends of these video

322
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
conferencing tools, then it doesn't work.

323
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't know what those guys are doing in Estonia.

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But they're doing a good job.

325
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In the UK and London, we also have a phone line for you to call

326
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
02076813753.

327
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Probably if you're calling from work.

328
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Or if you're twine like the hippie chick.

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, Adam.

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This is twine like the hippie.

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm calling it about the drink you mentioned on DSC405.

332
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The snake bite.

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The heck drink reminds me of an Irish car bomb.

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Drinks that also will make people crazy.

335
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
To make it, fill a shot glass.

336
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Half and half, fill a Irish cream.

337
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Jamison Irish whiskey.

338
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Then you drop this shot glass into a glass of Guinness.

339
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Shug immediately.

340
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Delicious.

341
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, an Adam.

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Remember at a previous Charlie where you asked me to kind of boil an ampoule

343
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
because you had been a very bad boy.

344
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I remember that.

345
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And that I'd let you know.

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll be at the poorville media ex-sobixier.

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So if you're continue to beat that on the Charlie,

348
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll be half to pack in the special pad.

349
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll put in your name on it.

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh.

351
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You, me and Barney, baby.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I really don't.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I really don't.

355
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And I think I do remember twine like the hippie chick.

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Send me an acopicture.

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Will you?

358
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

359
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I remember back in the late 80s at MTV.

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We didn't have email.

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We didn't feel it.

362
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
No.

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No.

364
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I did have email, actually.

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But no one else had email.

366
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Very few people.

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And they used to be just big postal bags of mail that would come in.

368
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Unbelievable sacks.

369
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I had a dressing room that had a, had a, had a, had it's own bathroom.

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And there was just no way you could read it all.

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It was just so much.

372
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And often on that was it to dial MTV.

373
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think was the, the show that is now TRL live was a total request live.

374
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So that used to be called dial MTV.

375
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And it always, I'd solicit pictures there too.

376
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And you know what?

377
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I used to get them.

378
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I was yes.

379
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We were 20 years younger back in the day.

380
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Hey, this past weekend.

381
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
How, how do you think our boys did there in Germany?

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Our, our US football team.

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I thought it was phenomenal.

384
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, phenomenal what these guys did.

385
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Richard Brewer, hey, who, a lot of the podcasters.

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Certainly those were on the Podgeo podcast network.

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
No, had, he's a former Brit.

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He actually became a US citizen about four or five years ago.

389
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's mad about football, of course.

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And mad about beer.

391
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And, and he set up a kind of like an informal meet for us all to go hang out

392
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
at the Valley Tavern.

393
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So I kind of stumbled out of bed.

394
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I actually caught the kickoff of the game here at home, which was at 12 o'clock

395
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and then hopped in the cab and, and screwed over there.

396
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And it was great.

397
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We were actually all standing in a bar, drinking, watching the game.

398
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And it was, it was cool.

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Here were Americans totally into the game.

400
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I've never seen this before.

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And, you know, the guy in the cab was like, hey, you know,

402
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
have you heard what's going on with the game?

403
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's, it's exciting.

404
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's really, really cool.

405
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And as I told you, I think that this game is perfect.

406
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's perfect because there's, you know, there's perfect for US sports.

407
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You know, it's, it is fast pace.

408
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There is, there's, you know, some real, there's some aggression on the field.

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And you can get pissed off yourself as someone just watching the game.

410
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Particularly if you've got a, if you've got a ref who's handing out yellow and red cards

411
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
like crazy, that was a bit outrageous.

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And then to, to wind up playing, you know, a draw, one, one,

413
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
with only nine guys versus, uh, versus 10.

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I thought was great.

415
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Although it was kind of funny.

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Uh, you know, people know I don't drink rarely drink.

417
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So, uh, but of course when you're in, you know, when you're in the tavern

418
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and you're watching the game, you've got to drink something.

419
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And so Richard said, yeah, you want to drink?

420
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So yeah, give me anything.

421
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So I'm like, yeah, I figured give me a pint or you know,

422
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
something big and manly.

423
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And what do you give me like a, a raspberry vodka?

424
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What's up with that?

425
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hey Adam, this is Chad from Vancouver to say,

426
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
work listening to the Charlie and I just wanted to say,

427
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
uh, I hope the American team has, uh,

428
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't know.

429
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This is some kind of hemorrhoid pillow,

430
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
or something because they're going to get butt fucked

431
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
more, man.

432
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Let's just be honest.

433
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Uh, this is interesting.

434
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Americans are not ready for soccer, dude.

435
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So, uh, anyways, uh, can't wait to watch the game.

436
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't know what I'm going to download it or watch it live either way.

437
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Uh, I'm sure I'll be watching the American team get butt fucked.

438
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And I'm always saying that because the Canadian team didn't get it in a pissed off.

439
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Anyway, uh, I love the show and, uh, keep it real.

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, boy.

441
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
All right.

442
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Well, clearly, they didn't, they didn't get spanked.

443
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They did a great job.

444
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And now if we can only beat, uh, what does it do?

445
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We have to beat Ghana now, of course.

446
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Turn out to be a lot stronger than anyone expected.

447
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So I put you to play that one on Friday with man.

448
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
How wrong were you?

449
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I boys did a great job.

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hey Adam, Chad from Canada here again.

451
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You watched the, uh, American versus Italy game.

452
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah, there you go.

453
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I spiked the draw there, but you got to admit to it.

454
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It only totally fucking raped American.

455
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, that's not true.

456
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What are you talking about?

457
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Not at all.

458
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It comes to the offensive line there.

459
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
They, they definitely had the advantages.

460
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Casey Keller is probably going to be, you know, one of the best gullies out there right now.

461
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He's unbelievable.

462
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Anyways, I just called to, uh, give my feedback on the game.

463
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I definitely think it only had the better offensive line there.

464
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But, uh, I don't know, man.

465
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That, that gullies was unbelievable.

466
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Now, on both sides of gullies, I'm unbelievable.

467
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, indeed.

468
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
This is a good game.

469
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I like to get draw and, you know,

470
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
but everyone's in a while, I like to see somebody get spiked.

471
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Anyway, um, don't take that dissectional.

472
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
No, I think you have sexual repressed problem to a friend.

473
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And by the way, isn't a World Cup soccer just a fantastic use of television.

474
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know, we've got all this, all the other media video, video media stuff figured out.

475
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We know what we really want to be seeing when it comes to video.

476
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But for sports, yeah, that television stuff got admit.

477
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It does kind of work.

478
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Hi, Adam.

479
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's Jordan from Grand Prairie, Alberta, Canada.

480
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Now, you might think I'm talking to you in the middle of a post-World Cup game mob.

481
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But you'd be so wrong.

482
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
As it happens, I live in a small city about 50,000 souls called Grand Prairie.

483
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
About 500 kilometers from Edmonton, home to the Edmonton Oilers.

484
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Now, the Oilers have made a comeback of a winning streak to force a seventh and final showdown from the Carolina Hurricanes.

485
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
As you can see, the crowd here doesn't seem to care what's happening in the World Cup,

486
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
so I guess it's like Einstein said, things are relative.

487
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, with jubilant honking horns to all sport fans out there,

488
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
whether it's hockey, cricket, basketball, or football, or football,

489
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
shoot a kill-in, keeping broadcasting in the center of pop culture in Grand Prairie, Alberta, Canada.

490
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
This is Jordan.

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, Adam.

492
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yo.

493
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Thanks for all your hard work keeping this new media of podcasting free.

494
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Not like beer, like speech.

495
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Right, I'm in.

496
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
See you later, dude.

497
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
They're actually people who tell me that besides the sense,

498
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
they didn't say, oh, subliminal programming, that whenever they hear someone click a lighter,

499
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
they think of the daily source code as well.

500
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Ah, it's work and my evil plan is coming together.

501
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Travis Martin says, hey, Adam, I'm an Omni Outliner user myself,

502
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but a friend once asked me to find him an app for windows that was comparable.

503
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Now, this, of course, was the only piece of software that I really missed using on the,

504
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
on the power book was Omni Outliner, a fantastic outlining tool.

505
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Just drag and drop files in, and you can play him straight from the outline,

506
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
or just it really worked.

507
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And I spent a good deal of time in the past week trying to find an alternative.

508
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There was, I don't even remember half of the tree.

509
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, so it was the one that I'd been using.

510
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, second.

511
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Let me check.

512
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I already deleted it from my, I already took it off.

513
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Anyway, so Travis turns me on to this new thing called Keynote,

514
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
which, of course, is not to be confused with Keynote from Apple,

515
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
which kind of makes it all that much funcure,

516
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
because Keynote is a presentation tool, and also kind of has an outline or built in.

517
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So I went to the website, and of course, you'll find a link to that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

518
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
or at curie.com when we cross post.

519
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And you'll see that I think the product that's discontinued the developer who was working on it,

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
no longer is supporting it.

521
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But, wow.

522
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Hold on a second.

523
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
If you want to hear more about that particular application,

524
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
you'll have to listen to the rest of the podcast at dailysourcecode.com.

525
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If you are checking us out on stars 102 on serious,

526
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and we've got Pacific Coast Hellway coming up next followed by Madge Weinstein.

527
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll see you guys tomorrow, okay?

528
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Take care.

529
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's like window closed.

530
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So I go over to the website,

531
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and check this out.

532
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I download this thing.

533
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This program, Keynote, is unbelievable.

534
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's exactly what I wanted.

535
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It has two, it has dual pains.

536
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So you can have your outline in one,

537
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and then the notes that go along with each node in a different one.

538
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It will let you, it will link to files that are on your disk.

539
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So that's relative, you can drag and drop stuff in,

540
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and then if you want to see what that particular file is,

541
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
or listen to it, you just click on it from the outlineer.

542
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It has tabbed view, it has all these amazing features.

543
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like how can I, how can I ever live without all this?

544
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And it resizes and you can have a vertical view.

545
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So instead of the tree outline on the left and the notes on the right,

546
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
you can have the tree outline on the top or the bottom

547
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and the notes underneath or above that.

548
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
If you're interested in outlining,

549
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and just for me it's the way I put the show together.

550
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You know, it's fantastic Keynote.

551
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Great stuff.

552
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
A couple more conversations to complete with me talking about the so-called illegal,

553
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
although it is highly disputed now.

554
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The drink snake bite, which is often consumed in the UK.

555
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Some say it's illegal, some say it's not, the jury's kind of out,

556
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
but it is a drink to be tried.

557
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Hi, I don't know if this is David Worthier.

558
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I like the Snipsing Real Life.

559
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm just a listener living the Charlie East since November of last year,

560
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and I hope you can get more podcasting.

561
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I have a couple of points on DSC 404.

562
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You've had a conversation with a gentleman who really is podcast,

563
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
really used to post-sign music.

564
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah, and haven't had a quick look at the post-sign music network,

565
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
fact page.

566
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It looks well.

567
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's a thing on detail to me.

568
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
There was also a comment on DSC 405,

569
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
which is a nice and signal post-sign music for commercial use.

570
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah, this is good.

571
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This is actually, we've gotten into some good stuff here about the podcast,

572
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and music network.

573
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
We kind of go over this once every couple of months,

574
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
but I think it's well worth it.

575
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
This was regarding putting up a companion feed.

576
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh, I forgot who was doing that.

577
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Anyway, the guys who were doing that immediately stopped,

578
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and they said thanks, now we understand better.

579
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah, if you go to the FAQs,

580
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
the frequently asked questions,

581
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
not all those questions are actually asked.

582
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I think we do need to update them.

583
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If you go to the terms,

584
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
which really there's only like three bullet points in the terms

585
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
that pertain to any of this stuff.

586
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It is very clear,

587
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and it's almost written in English,

588
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
not bad for a lawyer who put it together for Brian,

589
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
actually who wrote that up for us.

590
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But I agree,

591
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I think we probably should put a couple more lines into the FAQ,

592
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
just so it's abundantly clear.

593
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But it seems to me a lot of reports

594
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
on the DSC,

595
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and this my ship is more of a tacky time nature.

596
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You don't necessarily have good legal skills.

597
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

598
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What do I mean?

599
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Speak for yourself, man.

600
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Come on.

601
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Speak for yourself.

602
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Perhaps you could think of getting the fact that you expanded a little bit,

603
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
perhaps give some concrete examples of how podcasts

604
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
may or may not use public music.

605
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay.

606
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's a full.

607
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I was wondering also why more podcasts

608
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
don't use Bitcoin to distribute their programs.

609
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
There we have the old bit-torn question again.

610
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Well, you know what?

611
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It would make so much sense.

612
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Wouldn't it large media objects?

613
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The reason why is because this is one of those crazy things about technology.

614
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If Apple would implement Bitcoin on iTunes,

615
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I think you would see a lot of traction for this.

616
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And then all of a sudden everyone would be building this stuff in.

617
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But I don't believe Apple can ever do that

618
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
because Bitcoin has just has a huge piracy,

619
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
illegal connotation and aura hanging around it.

620
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And Hollywood would go nuts.

621
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And Apple of course has done the deal with Hollywood,

622
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
which we all should be extremely grateful for

623
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
because otherwise none of the...

624
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I mean iTunes is cool.

625
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
If you're looking for licensed music.

626
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
If you're looking for some easy way to buy.

627
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah, I mean yeah, there's all kinds of issues with the DRM

628
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and you can't play it here and can't play it there.

629
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But so they've done their deal with Hollywood.

630
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Do you think Hollywood would like even just the notion

631
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
that Bitcoin has built in?

632
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
These guys don't understand what technology is.

633
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
They just think Bitcoin thieves.

634
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And of course, Bitcoin is often used for theory as well.

635
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
There are lots of legal uses for it and it's just a technology.

636
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But that's the reason.

637
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So Apple would have to implement it and then it would gain traction.

638
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And then it still remains to be seen as to how well it would work.

639
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I've had varying results with Bitcoin.

640
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Some stuff is unbelievable.

641
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And by the way, BitTorrent on the PC definitely better on the Mac.

642
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I just thought that it would have made distribution podcasts.

643
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We're putting too much of a load on people's servers and all that easier.

644
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I don't know if there's something you've looked into.

645
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But it's just an idea ahead.

646
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah, well, of course, when we open up the podcast delivery network.

647
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
That won't be an issue because you'll be able to use that for free.

648
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And there's unlimited storage and unlimited bandwidth.

649
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And go ahead, eat all you like.

650
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Next up for the sleep lights.

651
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Your correspondence on DSC45 was right on the button.

652
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
This is remarks with regard to sleep lights.

653
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
To ask for points though.

654
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
If you ever find yourself in the service of the rest of the UK, be aware.

655
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So I did own here as much stronger.

656
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Especially in the form known as scumbee.

657
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You might like to think of it as the scunk of cider.

658
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Please approach it with caution if you're not a regular user.

659
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh, and if you do order a part of sleep lights.

660
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Make sure you drink it in a reasonable length of time as it tends to go a bit.

661
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And the fluke and sick is less than or more than 20 minutes or so.

662
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Final point, pops over the cream.

663
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Really missing pops over the cream this week.

664
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Christine got great taste in music.

665
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And if you just don't talk over the intro's note.

666
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Trills of songs along some porn characters I could mention.

667
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Anyway, I don't keep up with the work.

668
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Still loving the Charlie.

669
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm not a pilot.

670
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I do work in ATC.

671
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So also, and I would bother to be a secret at all 100.

672
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh, I can have.

673
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh, thank you.

674
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, I got chills on that one.

675
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The ATC dude, fantastic.

676
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Love you guys.

677
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Need you guys.

678
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Can't go without you.

679
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You've saved my ass many times.

680
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Quick give me a QDM.

681
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I need to know where the hell I am.

682
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah.

683
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Snake bite.

684
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay.

685
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
When I get back to the UK, we're drinking snake bite.

686
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You know what?

687
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll get Jimmy over.

688
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'll get Jimmy our next door neighbor.

689
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He knows about that stuff.

690
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
He's got to be.

691
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Those guys are drinkers.

692
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
My neighbors.

693
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'll ask him.

694
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I was going to make a real snake bite.

695
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
We'll drink one together.

696
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We'll do a sound seeing tour.

697
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
See how that goes.

698
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Pretty good comment about pot safe music.

699
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Just in general, not about the network.

700
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But about why you listen to it.

701
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll jump in once and a while.

702
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Good.

703
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Hey, what's going on there now?

704
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
This is Dan Patterson from the creepy sleep show.

705
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And hang it out on the Sunday afternoon.

706
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Listen to Friday's daily source code.

707
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And thinking about them.

708
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Bringing Marshall Claw and understanding.

709
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Maybe that's cleaner.

710
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I think both written and 60.

711
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But anyway, man, I'm thinking about pot safe music.

712
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And the phenomenon there.

713
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And I don't know if you know, I'm a broadcaster.

714
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I would do a seven and a midnight shift in a local rock.

715
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You're a professional radio pronounced to cater.

716
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You have all of the Lawrence welka albums.

717
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And, you know, I'm always trying to think of the program from the point of view of the

718
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Listen, which, you know, the broadcasters are supposed to do.

719
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And a pop.

720
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's what broadcasters are supposed to do.

721
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yes, that's true.

722
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But something went wrong about 15 years ago.

723
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Well, one thing that's just constantly reiterated.

724
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I've had program directors are just going to banging my head.

725
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's familiarity in music.

726
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But even if it's a new song, it needs to sound familiar.

727
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You know, people are very comfortable with certain chord progressions and certain melodies.

728
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And pop music will kind of repeat itself.

729
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You know, some people complain.

730
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And people think that's pop music.

731
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Wow, what an incredible insight into mainstream radio, huh?

732
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And that is true.

733
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Program directors and music directors at radio stations.

734
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
They'll say, hey, man, it has to have some kind of familiar sound to it.

735
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It has to sound like this.

736
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It has to have a certain beat.

737
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It has, of course, pop music in general.

738
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Those are kind of the rules.

739
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But you're so right.

740
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Which, of course, is if that's all you got, which is pretty much what we wound up with, is boring.

741
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But regardless of familiar song, it's a good song.

742
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
But also familiar band, you know, the od of you not feeling shit.

743
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You're first here in a major record label or far stackable.

744
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But if you do make it, if you do sell a lot of records,

745
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
you're obviously going to be preferred in radio over to over than over artists that aren't because they're.

746
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And isn't that interesting?

747
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You're obviously going to be preferred.

748
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Why?

749
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Why?

750
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's true.

751
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's true.

752
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But I don't think it's that obvious.

753
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But it's interesting that if you sell a lot of records,

754
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
then you're going to be more favored by radio stations to play you.

755
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Why?

756
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Hmm.

757
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let me think.

758
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Could it be a financial interest, perhaps?

759
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm familiar.

760
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The pod show, or in the pod show, the pod did music network has a similar conundrum.

761
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And that is the most of the bands and most of the artists are unknown.

762
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And it's been very, very interesting to watch more established,

763
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
but the HIPLATE labels look from credibility at the tap of course.

764
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And you know, let's see the whole rancid get-up thing running on the pod show,

765
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
plus right now.

766
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's very interesting because not only does that bring legitimacy and credibility,

767
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
validation from an album.

768
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But it might also help shows in terms of their, you know,

769
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
if you can play a song by a well-known army.

770
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And you can play a song by an up-and-coming that lessen our artists,

771
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and then play a pod stage song that most people don't know or wouldn't have heard.

772
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It seems like that would be great to be artists as well,

773
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
that affiliation with the note, excuse me, with familiar sounding music.

774
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Anyway, man, this is Camden.

775
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm getting ready for a writer's conference on Tuesday.

776
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You can check it out on the blog for bcb.com.

777
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Richard and Aaron, both are very helpful,

778
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
just one of the content, thanks.

779
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm out the door, take care, yeah.

780
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So about that familiarity, okay, a couple things.

781
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
First of all, in pod casting, we have something really wonderful

782
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
the radio doesn't have, which is the fast forward button,

783
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
or the pause, or even if you wish, rewind.

784
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You can go back and listen to it again.

785
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I can't tell you how many people say that,

786
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
oh man, you know, I skipped through that song.

787
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I didn't like it.

788
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Which is exactly what I'd expect you to do, you know?

789
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Now, about familiar familiarity,

790
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
about songs that sound like something else you've heard,

791
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I disagree.

792
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I really do.

793
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
What's happening with pod safe music for me,

794
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
is I'm hearing songs on other podcasts,

795
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and that's when the big, oh wow, moment came from me,

796
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
when I went, wait a minute, I know that song,

797
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and then you start to be able to sing along with the lyrics,

798
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
you know, the familiar, the songs that sound the same.

799
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It works, it doesn't matter.

800
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Sometimes you only need to hear twice,

801
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and then already you're humming along.

802
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That's basically a song that could become a hit.

803
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It has what I would call the music cure,

804
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
not the molecule, but the music cure.

805
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's got something in there that makes it all happen for you,

806
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
something that eats away your brain,

807
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and then it just keeps running around,

808
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and you can't get rid of it,

809
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and it's different for everybody.

810
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So, I have to disagree about that,

811
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
because, you know, yeah, repetition works,

812
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
but I don't think we need the repetition.

813
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We've been hearing in mainstream media,

814
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
at least it's a lot richer if you can hear a lot more.

815
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But there is something to be said about being played

816
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
alongside more established bands,

817
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
or bands that you've heard before.

818
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And, you know, I signed up for Napster,

819
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
because it came on the laptop,

820
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
just to see what it was like,

821
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and, oh man,

822
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
we're so deprived,

823
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
we really are all this great music

824
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
that is just not getting out there through this medium.

825
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's not getting out through radio either.

826
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I mean, there's no way that with the formats,

827
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the way the formats that radio have today,

828
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
that's just no way you can play all that stuff,

829
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
which is really, really bad for our culture.

830
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's horrible, I mean,

831
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
you know,

832
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
we know that kids who are growing up now,

833
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
listen to radio much less if at all,

834
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
so where are they going to get all their musical history from?

835
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I mean,

836
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I grew up listening to the radio in the United States,

837
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
and in the Netherlands,

838
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and listening to pirate stations offshore,

839
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and listening to radio Luxembourg,

840
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and,

841
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
you know,

842
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and I know little lyrics to songs from

843
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
almost all the songs from the 50s,

844
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
60s, 70s and 80s.

845
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The 90s,

846
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I kind of lost that I got busy,

847
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and all this internet stuff.

848
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You know,

849
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
so what are the influences going to be?

850
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
What,

851
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
you know,

852
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
when you look at the pod save music network,

853
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
look at any artist,

854
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and they'll tell you who they were influenced by,

855
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and it's a part of the bio for the sign-up.

856
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And, you know,

857
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
when they say some,

858
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I was,

859
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I always have to laugh when I see,

860
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
you know,

861
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
young guys,

862
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
whose influences were kiss and ACDC,

863
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you know,

864
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
but,

865
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
what's the next generation going to grow up listening to?

866
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You know,

867
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
are they going to hear these songs at all?

868
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Will it just be sporadic?

869
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You know,

870
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that's really, really bad.

871
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And it's a shame.

872
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Pure shame.

873
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The pod show ad challenge continues to rage.

874
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Submissions now are really flying in.

875
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I think it's because we're playing some of them

876
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and people are going,

877
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and they can do better than that.

878
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's like $2,000 you can win.

879
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But more importantly,

880
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
help us change advertising.

881
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Let's make it better.

882
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And,

883
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
so people are now creating kind of produce spots,

884
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
which I'm liking a lot,

885
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
but they're still room for all kinds of stuff.

886
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It can just be you talking about Earthlink.

887
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Check this one out.

888
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Whether you're just starting out,

889
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
prior a season and traveler,

890
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
let Earthlink be your bridge

891
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
to the world of the Internet.

892
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Like an old friend

893
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that you can always depend on,

894
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and will always be there for you.

895
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Earthlink,

896
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
always.

897
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Always.

898
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Up to the Internet,

899
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
AdChallence.podshow.com,

900
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
sending your entries.

901
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I like that one.

902
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And it's so cool because,

903
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
basically,

904
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
this whole competition,

905
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
this whole challenge,

906
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
is a commercial,

907
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
but for me,

908
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
it's just content.

909
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Isn't that what advertising

910
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
should be?

911
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Shouldn't it just be another form of content?

912
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Found a comment on curry.com from,

913
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
this come from,

914
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
the Guildford pub drinker,

915
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
who says,

916
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
hey Adam,

917
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
oh yeah,

918
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
that's right.

919
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I was looking for a pub.

920
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I hadn't yet found one in the UK.

921
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
If you want a pub in the area to adopt,

922
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
have a look at the onslow arms in

923
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Clandin.

924
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah, that's about five minutes away.

925
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's a 17th century pub,

926
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
perfect place to park your jag outside.

927
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Now,

928
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
that of course is quite a contradiction in terms there,

929
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
because yeah,

930
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
it's a perfect place to go drink,

931
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but does that mean I have to go up to drive there to drink?

932
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I don't know,

933
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that's a really good idea.

934
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Maybe I'll take Jimmy there,

935
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and we'll walk to Clandin,

936
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and we'll try out the snake bite.

937
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Holger,

938
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll heart says hi,

939
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
very interested how some people

940
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
make money off of everything.

941
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Oh,

942
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
this is about the German Chancellor.

943
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
This is great.

944
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I think I mentioned last week,

945
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
or maybe the week before,

946
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
that the German Chancellor is now doing a video podcast.

947
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Holger sends me a link,

948
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
where it turns out that,

949
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
this is great.

950
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
The actual costs being paid by the German public,

951
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I guess,

952
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
because it's tax euros,

953
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
is 26,000 euros

954
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
for the four editions of the podcast.

955
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Oh man,

956
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
somebody really did a good one there.

957
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
26,000 euros,

958
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and take a look at it,

959
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
it's like,

960
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the money's not on the screen.

961
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Let me tell you that.

962
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Maybe some of it's for bandwidth,

963
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
but it's a funny story.

964
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You got to read that.

965
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
There's always someone out there who's going to,

966
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
who's going to make some money.

967
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
All right,

968
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
not family safe,

969
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
but it is time for,

970
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
hey,

971
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
shit.

972
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Oh,

973
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Cranky.

974
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's not working.

975
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What is this?

976
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Let's try this.

977
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Does it work now?

978
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Comic strip.

979
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Comic strip.

980
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Comic strip.

981
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Comic strip.

982
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Comic strip.

983
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Comic strip.

984
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Comic strip.

985
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Comic strip.

986
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah,

987
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
he's back to his old antics.

988
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Hey,

989
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
yeah,

990
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Adam's like,

991
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
very hairy.

992
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Here is,

993
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
coming to the blogger,

994
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
now,

995
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
in second life,

996
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
as comic senior.

997
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Speaking of second life,

998
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I come to second life on,

999
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
on weekends,

1000
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
just to meet people.

1001
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And yesterday,

1002
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
again,

1003
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
avatas,

1004
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
in second life,

1005
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
asking me,

1006
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
is this rule

1007
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
that the fucker

1008
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Adam carried

1009
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
good board

1010
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
with second life?

1011
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And it's not coming anymore?

1012
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So,

1013
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
maybe you could,

1014
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
at least a second life question.

1015
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Speak.

1016
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
No, I don't know.

1017
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I must say,

1018
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I've been a lot more busy,

1019
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and,

1020
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
normally,

1021
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
uh,

1022
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I have time

1023
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
between

1024
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
one and the afternoon

1025
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and four

1026
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
in the afternoon,

1027
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
when I'm in the UK to do other stuff.

1028
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So that's basically after I've done my show

1029
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and gone through all the emails

1030
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and San Francisco hasn't woken up yet.

1031
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And that's a perfect time.

1032
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
They just chill back

1033
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
with a nice sense sale

1034
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
and,

1035
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and see what's going on.

1036
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I've been on,

1037
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I've been around,

1038
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
you know,

1039
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'd kind of bop in for a couple minutes at a time,

1040
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
uh,

1041
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
we've been working on some stuff,

1042
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
which I guess,

1043
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I guess this week,

1044
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
probably will be able to,

1045
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
uh,

1046
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
to talk about that.

1047
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
A new place to come and hang out.

1048
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Oh, yeah.

1049
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The work never stops at Podshow.

1050
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You know,

1051
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'd rather think.

1052
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
How it's done,

1053
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
kept his promise

1054
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and addressed the problem

1055
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
of internet streaming.

1056
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So both,

1057
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
how it's done,

1058
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
channels,

1059
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
how it's done,

1060
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
100 and 101,

1061
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
uh,

1062
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
now being streamed

1063
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
24 hours a day,

1064
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
seven days a week.

1065
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah,

1066
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Good for you.

1067
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Good for you.

1068
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
For serious subscribers of fucking course.

1069
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
What about fucking potential on serious?

1070
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Why the fuck?

1071
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It is not yet being streamed over internet.

1072
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Don't build it together,

1073
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Adam Kerry.

1074
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And address this problem once and for all.

1075
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
PS.

1076
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I am serious subscriber.

1077
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And I listen to what's then sometimes,

1078
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
but it's really speaking,

1079
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
he's the victims of sexual practices.

1080
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
They take the most parts of his show,

1081
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and it'd be boring.

1082
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But he's,

1083
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
uh,

1084
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
what's in the news,

1085
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Robin?

1086
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's brilliant.

1087
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So,

1088
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
fuck you later,

1089
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Kerry,

1090
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
spamming later.

1091
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah,

1092
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
comic strip blogger.

1093
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The F bombs are getting a little bit old,

1094
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
man.

1095
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You got interesting stuff to say in good questions,

1096
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
although that's serious stuff is so old.

1097
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I think we have a meeting with them,

1098
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
phone meeting today,

1099
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
or maybe it's tomorrow,

1100
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
go over some stuff.

1101
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'll ask again,

1102
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
it was streaming.

1103
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I know it was streaming,

1104
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and then it got unstream.

1105
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Not quite sure what's going on with that.

1106
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So,

1107
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
sorry, man.

1108
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Hey,

1109
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
there, Adam,

1110
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and all you daily source code,

1111
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
junkies.

1112
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
My name is Adam Crowloff,

1113
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and I am leader of a band called Captain Paradox.

1114
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
We recently uploaded a few songs

1115
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
to the Podsafe Music Network,

1116
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and it's freaking great.

1117
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
The reason why we decided to use this

1118
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and it's the first place we went to

1119
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
is because of the licensing agreement.

1120
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You start reading the licensing agreements

1121
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
in the fine print on a lot of these other sites.

1122
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It's fucked up,

1123
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
especially my space.

1124
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
If you upload a lot of these other sites,

1125
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
it's fucked up,

1126
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
especially my space.

1127
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
If you upload anything to my space,

1128
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
even if you deleted,

1129
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
it remains the property of Rupert Murdock.

1130
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It's wrong,

1131
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
it's fucked up.

1132
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
That's why I like Podsafe Music Network.

1133
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So, I'd just like to say,

1134
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
hey,

1135
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
thanks to Adam Crowloff.

1136
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Thanks to the Pod Show people,

1137
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
thanks to Podsafe Music Network.

1138
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We've been played in California,

1139
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
we've been played in the UK already.

1140
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's awesome.

1141
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
So, please check us out,

1142
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Captain Paradox at the Podsafe Music Network.

1143
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It was also got our own site at

1144
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
CaptainParadox.com.

1145
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Thanks again, Adam.

1146
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Peace out.

1147
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I got to run.

1148
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's just about 420 here in the steel city,

1149
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

1150
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah, yeah, there it is.

1151
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
What's that?

1152
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Right on, man.

1153
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Well, listen.

1154
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's just people, dude.

1155
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's just people who are loving music.

1156
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's what it's all about.

1157
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And being able to talk about it and me,

1158
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I'll just say, I love this song.

1159
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I'm going to play it for you.

1160
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And I do like the tune you sent me.

1161
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Upon the Podsafe Music Network,

1162
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Captain Paradox on your daily source code.

1163
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The television man is the child of the media.

1164
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The television man knows a telephone can feature.

1165
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The television man.

1166
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But we give us what he sees.

1167
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The television man knows about the bird.

1168
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The television man.

1169
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Always knows the score.

1170
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The television man.

1171
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Still he wants more.

1172
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
The television man.

1173
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Soaks his problems and now.

1174
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
The television man has a healthy respect for power.

1175
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
No man, they got him.

1176
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Right where they want him.

1177
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
No man, they got him.

1178
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Right where they want him.

1179
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The television man.

1180
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The television man.

1181
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The television man.

1182
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
The television man.

1183
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
The television man.

1184
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The television man.

1185
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
The television man.

1186
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Watch his life free and act.

1187
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
The television man.

1188
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
There's a bunker in our beds.

1189
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
The television man.

1190
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Sit on the fence.

1191
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
The television man.

1192
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
For a war or a CNN.

1193
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The television man.

1194
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The television man.

1195
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Was proud of his man.

1196
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
The television man.

1197
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Doesn't need to leave his chair.

1198
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
The television man.

1199
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
She's himself on the air.

1200
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
The television man.

1201
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Can make a friend through the phone.

1202
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The television man.

1203
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Does it rely to the Lord?

1204
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
The television man.

1205
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The television man.

1206
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The television man.

1207
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
The television man.

1208
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
The television man.

1209
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The television man.

1210
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
The television man.

1211
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
The television man.

1212
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
The TV.

1213
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Can.

1214
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The News movie.

1215
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,280
One thing I haven't addressed is the

1216
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,000
Podsave the Queen Podcast.

1217
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Here's Teenagers for you.

1218
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Ask Christina to hook up a Skype headset.

1219
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
She's like,

1220
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I might have my computer's crappy.

1221
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
She wants to do the show, but she wants the sound to be good.

1222
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
She doesn't want the, you know,

1223
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
now she's getting all picky and stuff.

1224
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And yes, of course,

1225
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
she can use cast blaster herself.

1226
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But she spoiled.

1227
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
She's just spoiled because she's not only child,

1228
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and we love her so much,

1229
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
but she spoiled because of the sound, you know,

1230
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and I've got the studio here.

1231
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I really need to set up another studio.

1232
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's what I'd like to do before I leave.

1233
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Before I leave San Francisco,

1234
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I get a studio set up here,

1235
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and I'll take my gear back,

1236
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and then I'll have something in both spots.

1237
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And then also I'll kind of have like a constant and consistent sound.

1238
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So Podsave the Queen probably not until,

1239
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
or probably not for another week until it comes back

1240
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
to a apologies from Christina and from myself.

1241
