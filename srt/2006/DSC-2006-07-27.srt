00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You are not seeing the forest with a wing DMM?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This dude is a pot-roar, we per seels in the duke doctor.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We've seen him on TV our whole life.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Super friends, we're the woman,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Stones, we're the last of the life.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I can be like any one, I see.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
On a record at a bonus leave.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is everhoo.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Dolls ain't the most of cash never on TV.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We are, we are.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The last of the sea for the heroes.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We are, we are.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The last of the sea for the heroes.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The last of the sea for the heroes.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Over the 1970s.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Sitting home alone, waiting low control In the silence home, no one left to go

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:00,600
No more super heroes on the 19th of the days The last time I see more heroes

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,600
The last time I see more heroes The last time I see more heroes

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
The last time I see more heroes

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:34,600
The last time I see more heroes The last time I see more heroes

32
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,600
We are we are The last time I see more heroes

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,600
We are we are The last time I see more heroes

34
00:03:48,600 --> 00:04:03,600
We are we are The last time I see more heroes

35
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
You know they are just days when you wake up and you need some American hardbreak

36
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Today being one of those days Thursday everybody how you are doing coming to you from a very foggy San Francisco

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Finally the weather is back to normal yeah it will be cool again

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Yeah coming to you from the curry condo

39
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
It is the coolest bachelour pad

40
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Except I am missing all the girlfriends to clean up

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
and cook and do stuff for me

42
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,840
gonna do stuff for me man. It's like I'm all by myself. I need to go home. I'm so

43
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,120
ready to go home. Patricia promised Monday we do a show. I can't wait after a

44
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,000
whole bunch of a week end of debotry as I have planned for. Speaking of Michael

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,680
Butler, of course you can find last of the superheroes, American Heart

46
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,360
Break on the Podsat Music Network link to that in the show notes. He is the

47
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,480
host of the San Francisco podcasters meetup and last night I went to my actually

48
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,200
was my first podcaster meetup ever shame on me. I have to say it's never quite

49
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,440
worked out for me to be able to attend one. But Richard Brueher, a Joe

50
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,000
Carpenter, they gave me no choice really. They said you're coming. You got to

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,280
come tonight and it was packed. There's a lot of fun. Met a whole bunch of

52
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,320
familiar voices, they will put faces to it a lot of the familiar faces there

53
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,760
as well. Two of the youngest podcasters or the world's youngest podgoat.

54
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:38,280
Let me see if I have my- Oh, I'm bearing me. I got my cards here. These

55
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,280
girls were too cute. They were so sweet. What is this? One, two, three, listen to me.

56
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,360
One, two, three, listen to me. Dotlipson.com. No, listen to me.

57
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,320
No, two, dotlipson.com. Sarah and Nina who do the podcast by kids for kids and

58
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,240
they got business cards. I was so cute that came over. I Yoda presented last

59
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,080
night, which is one of the reasons I wanted to go. Tim Mitchell, VP of

60
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,880
Marketing, showed what the- what is it? I Yoda independent online

61
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,120
distribution alliances doing very similar to the pod safe music network.

62
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,480
Except they- they actually have paying customers that would be the

63
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,120
record labels who pay them to help them disseminate and sell music.

64
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,760
And one of the ways that they obviously correctly see is through podcasting.

65
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,240
So I need to re-look at their license and see how close it is to the PMX. I don't

66
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,480
think we're very far apart. And the groovy thing is pod safe music network really has no

67
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,440
customers. Yeah, I mean, if you buy something, if you buy a track, but that

68
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,680
might asn't come to the pod show that goes to the artist. For podcasters, I guess

69
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,480
really is the audience primarily of the pod safe music network. I work a

70
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,840
place for them to go and find stuff to play on the show and promote and

71
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,520
become passionate about. And then on the other hand, it's also a place for

72
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,880
independent labels or artists to put their stuff up and make it available.

73
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a- it's a place without customers. Oh my gosh. Who would have

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,720
thunk it? I finally have some time though to socialize with the- with the

75
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,480
pod show folks. I was really nice. You know, I had my usual 1.5

76
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,440
more tinium was bouncing on my head by then. I just can't drink. But you can't

77
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,600
smoke anywhere. Can you? I guess. At least not- no, you can't smoke anything.

78
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,040
Certainly not what I like to smoke. And tonight I'm socializing again.

79
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,000
Ha! And this has been a long time coming. I am going to a show- I don't know,

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,600
is it- I don't think the show was caught. I think the person- the performance is

81
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,400
mink stole. And I'm going to be taken out tonight by our very own database

82
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,480
dominatrix aerononeal. And she said this is the show to go to. And we're going to be

83
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:54,760
a perfect pair. She's, uh, I don't know, she's 5, 3. I'm 6, 4. It's going to be just like

84
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,960
going out with Patricia. Only a little bit different. But I look forward to it. It's

85
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,240
going to be fun. So I'll have a full report tomorrow. And now that I finally,

86
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,000
you know, caught up on my sleep and I'm about to go home as usual. I think I'll be

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,760
able to handle it and still have a kick-ass Charlie for you tomorrow and Friday.

88
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,920
Today, this afternoon, I think it's eastern time. Do they have dual feeds?

89
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:20,760
Cali Lewis of Geek Brief TV is going to be on MSNBC. I'm not even sure what she's going to be doing

90
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:27,000
there. I presume she'll be interviewed. I hope so, at least. But I'm sure that we're going to

91
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,960
stop work at the office to see what's, see what Cali is doing. By the way, I love Cali's new

92
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:40,920
haircut. Or do you say quafuia? Her quaf is so beautiful. It makes her look even more energetic

93
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:48,520
and bubbly. And as we say, Cali, looking good. Cori and Jen, in 20 seconds, tell us, what is

94
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:55,160
bucket? It's bucket. Well, that explains it well. No, it's a show about every day stuff. Yeah,

95
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,000
funny things from our lives together. TV shows, the news. And we talk about the latest

96
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,800
movies and sports you talk about sports. And there's potty etiquette and kitty high jinx.

97
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,720
tons of pods safe songs and don't forget the monkey news because everyone loves monkeys.

98
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,440
Throwing a dash of geek talk and Jen stories about smoking catnip? We shut up about that already!

99
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,740
I was 13 years old. And um um um uh um um um um um um uh um uh um-

100
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,000
we curse a little too. For out of five, Dr's agreed. It's a podcast. It's bucket.

102
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:38,160
I don't know if you've ever listened to the Gilmour Gang, Steve Gilmour has a gang of tech

103
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,800
pundits and they talk about the latest news, usually about an hour, sometimes an hour

104
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,200
and a half, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, there's also a daily version, Gilmour Daily.

105
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,160
You can find Gilmour Gang at GilmourGang.com, G-I-L-M-O-R-G-A-N-G-D.com, big controversy going

106
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
on.

107
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,160
And this actually does kind of qualify everything.

108
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,240
with ten euros, ready for ten.

109
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:14,300
Tenfoil had moments, tenfoil ad moments

110
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,320
and now its time for the tenfoil hat moment.

111
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,920
So you kinda gotta know the players who are

112
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,000
who revolve in San Francisco,

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,300
who make everything shake and move.

114
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,900
It's quite a little clusterfuck here. I don't think the rest of the world cares too much, but in San Francisco

115
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,900
It's just wonderful to hear these guys

116
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:44,900
Yappin about other guys, and it's really it's just it's like a it's like a scrapbook knitting fest for geeks

117
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,780
But it's pretty enjoyable to listen to if you're into tinfoil hats

118
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,400
Let's see who's on the gang. I think Docs rolls is a perpetual gang member Jason Calacanis

119
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
of

120
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,160
Weblog Zankin, of course, now AOL on the new Netscape. He's

121
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,920
I think he's now a permanent gang member. I think he's fantastic

122
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,280
I love it when people just say what they want to say and Mike Arlington who is

123
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,120
Very well known in Silicon Valley for it was a tech crunch. I think and his meme around him also hit tech crunch. I'm sure is his and

124
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,520
You know, he is

125
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,360
The site that he has a lot of people

126
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:31,240
You know, we'll bring Mike Arlington in to promote you know their new stuff that's coming out and and he's got you know super VIP parties and he resigned from the Gilmore gang because

127
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,440
There was this other guy on a Nick car. I think it is now. I don't even know who he is

128
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,880
But there's this big bruhaha and it's and it's all over

129
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
The the blogger's career

130
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,760
But you've got it you've got a listen to a show

131
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I think

132
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,200
Gilmore is releasing it in either two or three parts because it's it's exceptionally long

133
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,560
I listened to the first part last night when it came home and it's great because

134
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Forget about the the topic of

135
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,440
Whether it's tech or geek whatever they're talking about doesn't matter when you hear raw emotions come out. That's what's cool

136
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,120
And you've never hear this stuff on the radio anywhere because you just imagine this type of show running an NPR

137
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,480
It would I mean it would shake so much up because you really hear people get pissed off at each other and that's nice

138
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,760
I mean it's anger's an emotion too. Just as valid as happiness

139
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So you might want to check that out

140
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,000
And this stuff happens from time to time and and I I just love it

141
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
That's the netting scrapbooking fest of the geeks

142
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,120
Yeah, you know someone sent me this a survey came out. I heard about it in a different show

143
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,440
Was it the BBC who wrote about this hold on let me just get this it's about to email

144
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,360
And the just of the story as I pull up the page actually the title is more than 95% of email is junk

145
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,800
It's spam error messages viruses and this is a report from email monitoring firms

146
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,640
Hmm, who's an email monitoring firm a return path?

147
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,760
Hmm, that probably a firm that sells something

148
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,200
Email security firm return pass at 99% of the computers at monitors that send mail have been taken over by spammers or virus writers

149
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,880
You know what I would agree with that. I would have to say that that a large percentage is spam and and it could actually be spam from people

150
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,120
You know, but it's still spam. I just send you a crap. You don't want to know about but here's the frightening thing

151
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
You know how you get those emails

152
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,480
That's a you know Viagra. There's other ones Xanx

153
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Which is a well known

154
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Was it a

155
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,160
Suppressant no

156
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,680
Xanx is an anti-depressant? No, it's not I don't know what Xanx is but it's supposed to take your fear away and a Patricia

157
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,440
Was prescribed Xanx because if you have a heart condition, what can happen is if you feel something going on, you know like oh

158
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I have a chest pain. I don't feel too good

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,960
you know your your fear can

160
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,960
Can take over and that fear can turn into adrenaline adrenaline takes the place of oxygen

161
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,720
Less oxygen in your bloodstream can actually make your chest hurt more if you have a heart condition it can you can spiral downward

162
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
So it's very important

163
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
But I caught it the other day

164
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
And she said

165
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,600
Yeah, oh, you know, I saw this other place where we might be able to buy Xanx and and I looked at the email message and it was

166
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,640
Completely one of these spam emails with like you know four lines in the in the email message itself, you know

167
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,680
Want cheap Xanx want cheap Viagra

168
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,360
But she had bought it she said and I said but honey, this is spam

169
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,440
So no, I know it's spam but you know

170
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,960
You might be able to get a cheaper there I blew me away my wife is very intelligent

171
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,240
I would never buy something from a spam but she doesn't care today

172
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,200
It looks like someone had an offer there and I was interested in I don't care how they presented it to me the words were stupid and lame

173
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,160
It worked for me. I went to check it out. Well, of course

174
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,680
I have forbidden her from purchasing anything through any of these unscrupulous people, but

175
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,720
This is it, you know, this is wide continuous because

176
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
It just fucking works

177
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,520

Hey Adam

186
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,720
It's just Karen Karen Karen hearty on

187
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,800
Deadly source code 427 you asked for people to send you requests for you to talk about 80s bands

188
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,160
I'm going to do just that. I became a banjo. We fan about 10 years ago

189
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,360
So I missed out on the first half of their career. Do you have any stories about them?

190
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,520
Yeah, I got a story about banjo V in

191
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,840
1988

192
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:37,240
There was the Moscow music piece festival and this by itself was a pretty interesting gig because

193
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,240
Moscow was still behind you know an actual wall that was in Berlin

194
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,640
There was no glass no stay was still very much communist Russia and the reason why I was organized is

195
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,960
Doc McGee who at the time was I don't know if he still he may still be banjo v's manager

196
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,120
He was also motley cruise manager at the time

197
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,240
He had been caught in some scandal involving smuggling. I think of marijuana on a private you know

198
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,760
Leer jet into my am and part of his punishment was he had to do community service

199
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,000
So he came up with a brilliant idea and was to do an anti

200
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,200
alcohol and anti drugs concert in

201
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Lenin Stadium in Moscow

202
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,280
And on the bill some of you may remember this on the bill. We're banjo v motley crew

203
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Azios born the scorpions

204
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,680
Gorky park which was a fine Russian band

205
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,400
Skid Row was the and of course MTV covered the event and I was the one that was sent on the chartered plane

206
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,360
It wasn't by no means a private jet. It was a chartered plane like a

207
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,720
737 with you know seats that barely reclined pretty much an easy jet before a very long flight from New Jersey to to Moscow

208
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,760
With one stop in Germany to pick up the scorpions and a couple things happened on the way that were there were notable

209
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
I don't know if I've ever told this story before but

210
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,280
Azio so Azio I'll get to banjo v in a minute, but Azio and

211
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,000
And the rest of Black Sabbath actually were on the plane. These are butler was on board and Sharon Sharon

212
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,720
Sharon who looked completely different. She was a little

213
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,800
Puggie English

214
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,760
Housewife literally but totally in control of of Azio and had to be because

215
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,200
You know anti drugs anti alcohol concert or not. I mean this plane was just booze and

216
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,960
so I'll never forget seeing Aussie standing in the

217
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,320
In the in the in the in the in the island of the plane near the laboratory and the laboratory was occupied

218
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,960
And so Aussie's you know standing they go share

219
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,400
And he let himself right there piston his pants and it was like okay, and that was you know

220
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,560
We were only 45 minutes away from New Jersey. We just left the airport

221
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
So I knew that was gonna be quite a trip and

222
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,880
One day I could get into all the different things that happened, but on the way back

223
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,680
And everyone was it was a two week trip everyone was just completely ripped and and you know

224
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
It had been a very intense time

225
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,200
Doc McGee had his personal doctor who takes care of his artist was along for the ride

226
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,680
And I don't know do you remember the Halcyon scare

227
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,280
Well, so the house Halcyon

228
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,920
I don't know which way I should tell you probably already figured it out

229
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,880
But anyway, everyone had a hard time sleeping in the seats really sucked and so

230
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Banjobe's personal doctor

231
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,400
Hand it out these little pills to anyone who wanted to get to sleep, and so yeah, I'll take one of those and boy did I sleep

232
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,720
I don't remember anything that happened after that in fact

233
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,680
I was pretty fucked up for the two weeks after that because it was apparently this Halcyon stuff

234
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,880
Which

235
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,560
Only six months later

236
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,600
After this trip was taken off the market because it could cause severe depression and had you know suicidal tendons

237
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,080
I

238
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,200
Okay, maybe next time I won't take the little yellow pill from the guy in the doctor's code

239
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,400
Okay, so just a little banjobe story for you if you have more bands from the 80s or 90s

240
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,040
Particularly the hair bands, but I can probably do it on almost anything you want to hear a story

241
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,080
Decended into the adamaccurry.com or call it in voicemail numbers in New Jersey

242
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:25,240
2016256357 so if you're using Skype put plus one two zero one six two five six three five seven if you're in the UK

243
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,640
want to call it the London number it's

244
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,760
Four four so O2O actually in London 768 one three seven five three

245
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,000
We do it on time

246
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,320
Perfect four more minutes until the window closes

247
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,840
Sit and there's that's the politics in the daily source code and they stay here

248
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
And this is Dan the previous could be show

249
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,960
waking up on a hot South Dakota morning

250
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
It's gonna be 112 degrees

251
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,760
In the mountains today and anyway, it was quite nice to hear some politics in the daily source because Dan was from believers

252
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,240
But regardless of art and affiliation

253
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,840
Once you're always taken into what's going on and yet

254
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Exercise in the Bible for this in the resource

255
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Kind of Jefferson with a dream

256
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,040
Keep it out man you don't have to get into part of the politics

257
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,280
But we're coming up in a pretty important midterm

258
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,160
Could be city will be carrying with gusto and

259
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
What I'm doing so is thank him sit

260
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,560
By the way, man Dan from the previously be show once again a little history lesson for you very briefly

261
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,120
A lot of the detention with Israel began in the mid-19th century

262
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,200
when many European Jews started to return to

263
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,960
Their home they're holy land, which is where they're currently at now

264
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,160
They're well funded and the causal on a resentment it just placed many steps in

265
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,160
In the living in the area the waters of Israeli inception were 1948

266
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,480
1956

267
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
1967 and 1972

268
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,200
And in 1948 when Israel declared herself state after many years of Zionism and

269
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Continuing escalation

270
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,440
Jews in the Palestinian homeland

271
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,560
She was immediately attacked by her neighbors

272
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Sidney, and I just know this shit

273
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
So anyway

274
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,480
This is fantastic

275
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,120
48566772

276
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,960
All right, so what you're saying

277
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,360
Dan from creepy sleepy show is that we were about do another conflict

278
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,840
Which I'm just calling a war I call him as I see him

279
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,640
Big difference though for the first time in any type of situation like this

280
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
The media is no longer controlled by

281
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,600
governments

282
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,760
The media in fact in 1970 most European media was 100% was all government controlled owned

283
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,120
Et cetera and even in most countries in Europe mainstream media is now commercial and have different different agendas

284
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Their own agenda primarily

285
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,800
But we really have the media now so things have changed but I don't think that

286
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,640
The leaders of any party any country have have changed very well along with it or really recognize or realize what's

287
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,720
What's gone down so I think first of all that makes it seem a lot worse because it probably always was this bad

288
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
We just didn't see it that bad and

289
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,840
And

290
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,000
The only thing I'm missing kind of is the debate

291
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm not I'm not I'm not seeing the debate a lot on web logs which I find a little bit disappointing

292
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,960
But I stand by what I heard I really do and I do not understand how this works if

293
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,800
President Bush

294
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Arguably the leader of the free world

295
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,280
Literally said in a moment of

296
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Complete honesty there's no doubt about it. He wasn't bullshitting Tony Blair because

297
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,440
That only happens when we're on camera. That's when all the bullshit comes out whether you're

298
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,440
President or whether you're you know

299
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,720
Mary hard of entertainment tonight the bullshit starts when you're on camera

300
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,400
So off camera. I heard it a sod has to call has Bulla and tell him to stop that shit

301
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,840
Could somebody please make the fucking call already

302
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Comic strip

303
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Comic strip

304
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Comic strip

305
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,000
All right, so we're getting it set up comic strip blogger one of the illustrious

306
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,400
Personalities who appear on the daily source code. I'm going to set up an interview with him

307
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,720
I have to give him one month's notice and it has to be on a Saturday

308
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,840
But it'll actually come over to a to the UK to do it and

309
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
For more about that and

310
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,200
All of the Friday festivities those of you on serious 102 will have to tune in tomorrow

311
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Because if it goes hellwise next for all you guys

312
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,920
And CSB of course has sent something in force little present. I know that you are cooking in the

313
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Potential juice and you hardly see the word outside of Potential ink

314
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,200
But let me tell you about the problem in blogosphere

315
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,440
Namely despite Google claiming that it does not evil the blogging service on by Google

316
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:12,040
Blogspot is hosting several slender blogs where anonymous scam people are attacking others and the

317
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:18,280
Google refuses to take down such blogs with slender. I have seen blogs where anonymous scam

318
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,280
Is ridiculing people's wives people's houses and just trying to destroy people

319
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,280
Probably because these people are in competition with these scam anonymous bloggers

320
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,920
Yet Google refuses to remove these blogs where anonymous scam

321
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,200
Attacks people in criminal way conclusion this Google has

322
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,480
Do no evil principle is the biggest bullshit on this planet

323
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,920
Let me tell something to Sergei brain one of two bosses of Google in his native language ration

324
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,080
Well, what are you doing Sergei to be another as a shithead to the problem?

325
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,080
But at least you have to pay attention to the company in the august rationality

326
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:08,280
Potipity new data. Okay, so keep funneling your blackberry keep cooking in Potential juice. Yeah, you know

327
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,720
Oh my gosh, he speaks Russian now, too. We've had Polish. We have German. We have English. We have I've seen him

328
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,840
Come up with some Dutch. He does Italian Russian the man never ceases to amaze me. I'll bet you speak some

329
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,160
Finish as well. I mean, didn't he work for Nokia? He must speak some finish. Well comics are blogger

330
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:37,160
You have just witnessed human nature. I see no difference between what is happening in many places in the world take the

331
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,800
The Israel Lebanon conflict

332
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,800
You know you could say the same thing as like the Google of this war is America and they refuse to take down the blogs

333
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,960
You know, I still kind of wonder you know when Israel sends a couple of bullets up a Lebanon's ass

334
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,600
It does say made in America, doesn't it? What is on the Lebanese missiles? Who makes that shit that they make it themselves?

335
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,680
They buy it from someone else. You know, who's the Google of them? Who's making that stuff for them?

336
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,360
It's just human nature comics are blogger. I don't think you you shouldn't even look too far behind these things

337
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,000
It's just it is I really believe it's human nature

338
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,200
Eventually people just get into rifts with each other. It happens on every single mailing list. I've been a member of

339
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,160
Every

340
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,840
Every community particularly in an online world where everybody is equal this happens

341
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,120
And happens it's nothing to do about it man. If I went after everything which I thought libeled me

342
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,480
I would have no hours left in the day to simmer in my pod showed juice

343
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,480
Mm-hmm

344
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,760
Part of the interview that I'll be doing with comics to blogger or with what I thought was jacic rootowski

345
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
I don't know why I was saying well

346
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,160
a J.A. C.E.K. is to me. I wanted pronounce it jacic and

347
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,320
That's incorrect because here's the correct pronunciation of comics or bloggers

348
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,080
real name. Yeah, thick

349
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Yeah, thick

350
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,240
Yeah, thick, yotsick yotsick yotsick rootowski now

351
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,600
I was listening to that because that CSB actually pronouncing his name. I was listening to that and

352
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,360
I could hear something in the background. Let's listen again. Yeah, thick

353
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Yeah, thick

354
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Yeah, thick

355
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
Do you hear that? It sounds like a kid in the background

356
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,240
List this one. Yeah, thick listen closely. Yeah, thick

357
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Yeah, thick

358
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,840
It sounds like some kid is talking to another grown-up

359
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,240
Okay, so we know a little more the puzzle is starting to come together comics to blogger

360
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,600
Most likely has a wife and maybe even a child

361
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Mm-hmm

362
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,360
Naptate on the Troy needs an iPod contest member. I'm giving away an iPod

363
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Video iPod no less

364
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,160
Let me see now. I got to go for a shoot. I got to go to my site here

365
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,760
I'd asked you to put all entries into

366
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
The comments a daily source code dot com

367
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,600
Some people continue to post it at curie dot com. It's it's not gonna be valid if you post it over there

368
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,320
You know, I want to have it in one place. So don't send it on email either. Let's see

369
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,840
Yesterday's okay. We got some comments here

370
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,800
Let me just run through a couple of the entries. I remember this is an ad hoc competition

371
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,360
So a void where prohibited by law. You know, it doesn't cost anything to enter

372
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,040
You know, I'm not a lawyer. Praise Murphy yada yada

373
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,640
Adrian has an entry. There's more to podcasting than iPods dot com like that one. That's good

374
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,160
Troy, what is Troy saying? I don't know what Troy is saying

375
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,640
Here we go. This is from

376
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,840
RDFHG

377
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,880
Nice handle. I would like to win but I'd rather buy my own iPod dot com

378
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:08,280
Yeah, I like that one. That's good. What do you have here iron mask and iPods not just for porn dot com?

379
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,720
Yeah, it's very cool freshly registered from godaddy dot com using promo code DSC3

380
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,480
Thank you very much

381
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,360
You can use any of the pod chill promo codes by the way. It does not have to be for DSC use it for your favorite show

382
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,360
Let's see here we go. Oh, this is a this is a long one

383
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:31,240
Screw Troy. I can barely afford a cheap domain name let alone an iPod dot com. Oh, man

384
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,520
This is getting bad

385
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,720
By the day

386
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,920
Remember the original is Troy needs an iPod dot com and Troy is still very much in the running

387
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,720
Of course, I'm the only judge

388
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,920
Let's see

389
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,000
Here's another entry. I want an iPod by listening to the Charlie. Yeah, very cool

390
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,680
And of course, there's Troy with his original so I'm gonna keep this open a little bit longer

391
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,840
Maybe another couple days maybe midweek or so we'll choose the winner

392
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:01,400
I always have to give people a little bit of time to catch up because you know not everyone's on the same listening schedule as as the production is

393
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,560
Oh, what's this firefox one dot five dot oh dot five ready to install

394
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,960
Firefox is just completed downloading an important update. Oh, it must be restarted now. No, you can't restart

395
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Dude, I'm in the middle of my show

396
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,480
Helicopter crash and Afghanistan Kevin toffel sent me

397
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,880
No, I'm sorry that's Kevin is for something else who sent this Alexander on-off

398
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,880
And unidentified helicopter crashed in south eastern Afghanistan Wednesday reportedly causing casual casualties

399
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
few other details available apparently two

400
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,600
Dutch

401
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:43,160
Troops were killed in this crash now. I'm very worried about this because the details are completely sketchy

402
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,560
But the guys that I the Dutch marines the air division

403
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,840
Who flying the chanook helicopters who I was with in in Iraq. I know a lot of them are

404
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Now in Afghanistan so Han

405
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,440
Who was Corona one in Iraq is now ghost 13

406
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,280
He's a pilot of chanook and has a has a full crew

407
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,080
In fact, I know that he's one of the guys that went down in Iraq with that Dutch helicopter

408
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,240
Up on top of the mountain successful landing everybody fucking walked away from it

409
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,640
So I hope that this has nothing to do

410
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:27,080
Oh, I mean it's horrible that anyone has been hurt or or killed in a crash, but I really hope it's not any of these guys

411
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,160
So if anyone has any information please let me know

412
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Really really like to know if possible

413
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,120
Okay, so as I said it's just two more days

414
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
Sorry, that's a major stretch in y'all

415
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,080
And then I'll be back on a different schedule so I can do the show

416
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,080
I'd like you know, it leisurely 11 a.m. instead of getting up at six every single morning and

417
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,320
Tomorrow of course

418
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,400
We'll be thank God it's Friday edition of the Charlie and I need your

419
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,320

What are we gonna play let's rock it out?

421
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,720
I haven't heard from the official musicologist in a couple days jersey Todd, you know, let's let's get some cool gems

422
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,120
Please get them for me send them to me email them to me at amacurry.com spam by the way solved

423
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Played a couple different songs by these guys

424
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
And but not this one apparently

425
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,720
Outfit's called get go three check it out

426
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Yeah

427
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,520
Too far gone below to ever make it back on deck

428
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,800
I'm a spec between the timbers of a foolish ship ride and rivers of philosophy

429
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,480
And for the crap out of any bomb dumb enough to listen to me

430
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,200
The courtroom's the place for this face taking the stand looking my hand

431
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,040
We'll never before have a bad bad attention

432
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,080
Or maybe just the ones but the guy was so strange there

433
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,240
You never showed a lot like terror and if he didn't want the advert to have been made

434
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,880
I wait until the fence I guess my best defense was to suffer in silence

435
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,920
I never find the words when I'm confronting violence

436
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,600
And anyway do you know anyone who thinks that fast when they know the next words going to be

437
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,720
There last so the one consumed with regret my beautiful faces intact yet

438
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,760
And I said I need you to like me

439
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,960
I like you didn't fight me

440
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,760
I need you to like me

441
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,960
I like you didn't fight me

442
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,680
I need you to like me

443
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,240
I like you didn't fight me

444
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,600
I said I made you to like me

445
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,320
I like you didn't fight me

446
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,320
but when I was the time I was drinking in the Memorial

447
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,120
The music on the box sent me, well, higher, and if you need to have a song that was

454
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
one of the power.

455
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
You have to last there.

456
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Order.

457
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,120
Castblastard.com and download Castblastard.

458
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:52,120
It's available for Windows only currently, or it's available for Windows only.

459
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:59,120
But you can download a version that'll let you record 10 minute podcasts for free forever.

460
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,120
And if you sign up for Pod Show Plus and you want to make a podcast there, you can actually

461
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:10,120
upload everything, your show notes, your RSS, all the podcast feed stuff, all the stuff

462
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,120
you have to have, but don't really want to know about, we'll be generated automatically.

463
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
And it integrates perfectly.

464
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Now, we've also been in contact with the Ubercaster guys.

465
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,120
I believe the Ubercaster is now available for beta download.

466
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
I don't know if anyone's tried it out.

467
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
No one has sent me anything.

468
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Any, of course, I'll be looking for an audio comment about it because my Mac is still in repair.

469
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
My power book.

470
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Hopefully it's going to get fixed because there is some data that I wanted off of it at the very least.

471
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
But we have been in contact with them.

472
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,120
And we've made an, it's called an API and application program programming interface,

473
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:52,120
which is basically a way to connect external programs to the Pod Show Death Star engine.

474
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:58,120
And it's something called the MetaWeblog API, and with a couple of tweaks and changes there.

475
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
But it's all documented.

476
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,120
You can find it at developer.podshow.com.

477
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,120
And the Ubercaster guys, as far as I know, are implementing the API.

478
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,120
So when you're done recording something with Ubercaster on your Mac, you'll also be able to

479
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,120
shoot it all right up to the Podcast delivery network.

480
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,120
And of course, that's open for any other program.

481
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I hope to see audacity implement as well, pretty soon.

482
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,120
So that's, that's it.

483
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
They think that got to get out of here.

484
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
I got to go to the office.

485
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Hey, everybody, take care of yourself.

486
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
Thanks for listening.

487
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Adamaccurry.com, dailysourcecode.com.

488
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,120
I'll see you tomorrow for a thank God, it's Friday edition of The Cha Cha.

489
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,120

490
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Stick it in your ear.

00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Get this Podcast and we're great ones like it.
