1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
From New York, Delta Sierra Charley, three, three, five.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're 16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Such me so slowly, it is.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, I think I know where I am now.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I like it and better, you're looking out, you make it so hard.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're telling me not all of them.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're having to go, yeah.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're pushing my hands down in my lips.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm getting cold, yeah.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're so afraid.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid I'm playing you.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not that jerk who's always messing with your heads and now.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Who's?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let me stay, you wanna play, you wanna play with you.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let your baby.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Bear with us.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't walk away, you'll never stay, let me be with you.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, don't let it in this way.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have a body root for the girl.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The wheel they walk away.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Play, play, yeah.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What about the band of girls?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I love to be just like that way.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I used to go.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Right now I'm young, yeah.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We get so sexy when we make it dancing slower.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm gonna stay, you wanna not play with you.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're just not used to guys, don't mess it with your heads and now.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Who's?

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let me stay, you wanna play, you wanna play with you.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let your baby.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't let it in this way.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think you wish I was a different person all together.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I do believe I am the right one to run down.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you don't know what I put up with with your crazy head,

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
you're gonna regret that day.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You let me get away.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Just wait and say you wanna play, you wanna play with you.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let me hear about you, yeah.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, I'm close.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, I'm close.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, I'm close.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, I'm close.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, I'm close.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, I'm close.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, I'm close.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hey, Larry.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hey, Larry.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hey, Larry.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Brother love on the Charlie.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, everybody.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How are you doing?

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Coming to you from New York.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is the Daily Source Code in my hotel room.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It is Valentine's Day, Tuesday.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's early, early, Tuesday.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How you doing, everybody.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Sorry about Monday.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you missed the podcast yesterday, boy, I had an interesting trip.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of course, you probably know that New York had the most snowfall on record

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
or some ridiculous statistics like that.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Something all the news channels could talk about.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I left on Virgin Upper Class Sunday to fly to Newark Liberty International Airport.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I've learned it's actually called Liberty International Airport.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You should be just a Newark.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I always fly to Newark if I can.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm really happy that Virgin flies there.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That of course is because they're deal with the continental.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But I like Newark as an airport.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's really nice.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Undervalued, I think, of the three New York metro area airports.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But actually, so we left while Newark was closed due to the snow.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I guess that they had been told the airport was expected to open and we landed.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Maybe only 10 minutes past schedule.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think we're supposed to land at 10 minutes to seven and we landed around 705.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And then we sat on the ramp for, oh, gee, I don't know, two hours and 45 minutes.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It was nuts.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The reason being, there was an LL747 that was blocking the way.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And we just could not get to our jetway because it was stuck in the snow.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And now imagine, you know, it's not like you put some wooden planks underneath the wheels.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Or throw some sand down.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This takes a little bit of a little bit of work.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And then I finally gave us a different jetway to go to.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And of course, the jetway was frozen.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And we couldn't get that up to the plane.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So that was pretty gnarly.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Of course, that delayed everything significantly.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
PW Fenton was also coming into Newark.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And we left at the same time.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We were actually texting each other.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I left at, see, my flight left at 4 p.m. on Sunday.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Of course, I'm flying back in time.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And he, his flight left around the same time.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So that was what four is like 10 a.m. or something like that.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Florida time.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He only had a two hour trip.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I had a seven hour flight.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And we both were on the tarmac at the same time.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He got the same, you know, he got such mega delays.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And we actually passed each other.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I played past his jet blue plane.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And we're texting back and forth.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He even got to the hotel later and I did.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I tried jumping like an SUV with four other British businessmen.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And we had a kind of interesting ride into Manhattan.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Lovely.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That was beautiful.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We're downtown in Tribeca at a hotel.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've never stayed up before.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's just beautiful.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And it's so New York.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You know, this is, if you imagine New York in the snow.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And the kind of the warehouse like buildings.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Gosh, man.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It is picture picture perfect.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And the snow is piled up high on the sides of the streets.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And people are slipping and sliding.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And it's beautiful.

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But still, the city is functioning.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
People are getting around.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And cars are able to move.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And we were able to conduct business, which was really.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What was.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What the strip was all about.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And see, who do you have?

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let me just tell you.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We've got to run us here with his wife.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
His lovely wife, Marta.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm here.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So, though.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And before I continue, of course, it being Valentine's Day.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She probably won't listen to the show.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But you all know how much I love my wife.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I sent her such a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And actually, she, you know what?

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She, let's do this.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She gave me a card and envelope.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let me just, let me just grab.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, actually, I have something for this.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, I'm so prepared.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're going to love this.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I brought the superset up.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I can actually mix in.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There we go.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So I can mix in the, the wireless microphone.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let me walk over to my bag.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
See, of course, you know, whenever they asked me at the airport,

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
did you pack your bags yourself?

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I always have to lie because of course I didn't.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My wife pack my bag.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, I don't know.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not going to tell them that.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now, I'm back onto the, to the Heil microphone.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There we go.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Now, cool.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Was that she, let me just, let's share the card.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's see what she said.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
To my Valentine Adam.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
She loves card.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
She doesn't do it like that.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do electronic stuff.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is beautiful.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's so pretty.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So it's a beautiful card with, you see, kind of an ardeco coffee table with two

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
copper chinos on it.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Pair.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can see the iPhone tower in the background.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then you kind of see the tables at eye height.

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And you see clearly a male in a female hand holding hands on the table.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And it says, happy Valentine's to the one I love.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I stole a touch and he opened up the card.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It says, you stole my heart.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And then it's a personal note here.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's in dot.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I'll read the Dutch part.

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And if you speak Dutch, you'll like it.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The Benjamin Crow to leave the informal states.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The Kribbles in my bag.

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll say, now you can't.

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Forever my Valentine, your Patricia.

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Wow.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
20 years.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And still.

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Just like yesterday.

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He was like the first time.

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Any foreigner song.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can think of applies.

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I'm here solo.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And we're both happy to sacrifice.

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Not being together on Valentine's day for the greater good of podcasting.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
She's assured me.

198
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's see.

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
KJ finally got here.

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He was stuck in Dallas.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He came in from San Francisco.

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Chris Jacob.

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Our SVP of business development.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And he was in Dallas for like 48 hours.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And she had like that.

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We have Greg Mann, who was also from our sales and business department.

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The pod show he's here.

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And let me see.

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Pete, I'll be a fenton.

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's here as you know.

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
His dad was here this evening.

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Paul Vogelsang, or Folgelsang, as we would say.

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Of the mommy castors was up here today.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's just been fantastic.

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And of course, no parties complete without brother love, who I gave him a call.

216
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And he popped right on over.

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And we just had a good time.

218
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He meets a pizza downstairs in the lobby and other assorted finger food and drinking a little

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
bit and talent tall tales.

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's really cool.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And tomorrow, it'll be back to work, back to the grind.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But we're having a lot of fun on Madison Avenue.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, by the way.

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Check this out.

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I picked one up for myself.

226
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We're not going to have a metro section moment in today's show.

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But check this out.

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you know what that is?

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes.

230
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Indeed.

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Those in the know.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It is the Gillette Fusion.

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The five-bladed job with the precision blade tomorrow.

234
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll be testing it out.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Because I already shaved for today.

236
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I will bring a full report in the metro sexual moment.

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Of course.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
See what else we're going to talk about.

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, gosh.

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This was the funniest thing.

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So we've had several meetings.

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And, you know, we're here talking to advertisers, talking to agencies.

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is basically taking orders as well.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And doing some education where education is needed.

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Very interesting.

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The questions that are out there.

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And some of the challenges we've been given.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But one thing really, really freaked me out.

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We're in a meeting today, this morning.

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And, you know, as we're talking about stuff, and I'm talking about user-generated advertising.

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We're talking just about, you know, where this whole mash-up of media is going that we,

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you know, the podcasting is a part of.

253
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And one of the guys in the meeting holds up his phone.

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And he says, and I could already kind of tell the, you know, that they had listened

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
at least once or twice, certainly to the source code.

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And these guys were, were glued in.

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And the holds up his phone.

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He says, you know, listen to this.

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So, of course, unfortunately, I don't have anything to play from Roger,

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because I haven't heard from him in a kind of, about a week or so now.

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But Roger, you're famous.

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You are big and new, but you're, maybe, you're happening.

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
How you doing, everybody?

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is Marcus Couch from the scenes scene and pod show music rewind.

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I just want to let everyone know that the newest episode of pod show music rewind

266
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
is out.

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's episode number 20.

268
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And it features the usual suspects, the rock and roll geek indie cast,

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
in over your head, accident hash and the scenes scene.

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But as you know, last week, we put out the call for new guest pod casters to join the

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
play.

272
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And this week, I'm proud to present mad pod hosted by J. A. Donnelly, the Jersey Todd Show,

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
which is hosted by Todd from New Jersey, the Miami Valley Music cast hosted by Rich Palmer

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and zero gravity radio hosted by Mark Rees.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And these are some great music pod cast that you guys should check out.

276
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And they feature music from the pod safe music network.

277
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And I'm happy to have them on board.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So check out the show pod show music rewind.com.

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And if you'd like to submit a clip for your music pod cast, you can edit together

280
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
about a five minute clip.

281
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Make sure it's got songs from the pod safe music network and email that to podshowmusic

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
rewind at gmail.com.

283
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Thanks again, everybody.

284
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This is Marcus Couch.

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Take care.

286
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Marcus kicking some ass there, dude.

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So yeah, we're definitely looking to expand the pod show music rewind.

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's a great show if you've never, if you haven't heard it before, there's also an enhanced pod cast version of it.

289
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And so there's a chance to be in this show to contribute.

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
By the way, I forget who sent me the Curry Sauce DSC jingle at the start of the show,

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
but I love it.

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank you very, very much.

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm just a little discombobulated.

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I've got the jet lags and stuff like that.

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I need some new openers, man.

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But that was just great.

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
As an email that I received, I just wanted to share with you,

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
because it just shows what pod casting can do and what people will do to get pod casting.

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Dan Gray sent me this email.

300
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He says, Adam, I've been listening to pod cast for a year or so now,

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and wanted to share with you an insight into how pod casting helped one guy out over the holidays.

302
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I recently returned to the UK after two months in Iraq.

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Hey, I know you visited, and can report that pod cast helped to keep me sane.

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Now, I presume that he's in the service has to be almost judging from the email.

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Let me tell you, having been in Iraq for a week, I can imagine how a full tour of duty could drive you really insane.

306
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a real treasure of pod casting.

307
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Something that no one else has, the ability to listen to anything you want to in some very strange places.

308
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I had to jump through hoops to download pod cast out there and check this out.

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I wrote a CGI script that would download a pod cast,

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
reencode the MP3 file to a very low bit rate, split it into floppy, dissized chunks,

311
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and placed it on my web server for download.

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Many thanks by the way to the guys at t35.net.

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
For a long way to abuse their paid hosting service a little.

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
For a half hour show, this process took about three minutes.

315
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So basically, that was, I guess, happening at home on as one of his machines in the UK.

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then waiting for me would be three to eight, one point four megabyte files that I could place on to floppy disks.

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Of course, no USB thumb drives allowed in the service, I guess.

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And take to my laptop to join and listen to, using piles, floppies,

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
felt like a step back to the stone age.

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Using this process, I was able to listen to a podcast every two to three days.

321
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Obviously, I couldn't listen to everything I wanted, but geek counterpoint,

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the daily source code, coffee geek, and rockin' old geek show,

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and the BBC all helped keep my spirits up and what can be a lonely and tedious place

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and a time of year when it's hard to be away from family and friends.

325
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Obviously, I could do this only for myself because I'm a technical guy,

326
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
but it's an interesting proof of concept and maybe an application that podcasting should look at, multiple bit rate feeds.

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Good point there.

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
My thanks go out to the Lauren, to the Lauren, Michael, Mark, and yourself for keeping a fellow pilot happy.

329
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Well done to the BBC as well for taking a lead amongst commercial broadcasters,

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
nice to see him thinking ahead.

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And this really just blew me away.

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
First of all, the inventiveness of it all.

333
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And really taking some of that into consideration, some of these multiple bit rates.

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And that is something that we should probably think about on the podcast delivery

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
network as well, which I think today the press release goes out about

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
our partnership with limelight networks.

337
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I hope it's today because I'm about to make some ten announcements.

338
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Not like those of you listening to show didn't know about that,

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
but for I would have to say probably six months.

340
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We worked on understanding bandwidth, understanding building it versus purchasing it,

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
understanding pricing, understanding players, understanding and when I mean players,

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I mean who would a play is, who to play is be understanding content delivery networks

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
that work with streaming versus large media objects.

344
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And we hired all kinds of people to come in and help us.

345
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And we really, really spent a long time.

346
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And when we finally met Bill and his team over at limelight networks,

347
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
well, instinctively, I already knew that these are going to be the guys for us because

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
they're renegades.

349
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They're sitting in there in Arizona flying under the radar,

350
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
but kicking some major ass.

351
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And they've got just such an incredibly strong technical team.

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They're the architecture of their network.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I know a little bit about peering and really being on the back bones.

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The back bones, baby.

355
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's from my data, my data barn days in the Netherlands.

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And so happy that we were able to work this out.

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And these are the guys that have really worked with us and are working to support independent podcasting.

358
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So that we can give you all these fantastic services for free if you're interested in joining the podcast network.

359
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And of course, details of that are coming soon.

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But the whole point here is to really level the playing field and give the independent podcast or

361
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
just as much opportunity as the mainstream.

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And then some, we feel.

363
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So I hope that that press release goes out today because I really already told you a lot about what it's about.

364
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And this isn't the corporate message.

365
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This is just me saying how incredibly happy I am.

366
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I've been using limelight for a couple of months now.

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The daily source code has been rolling on the limelight network.

368
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And you know, here and there we've bumped into a couple of interesting little things.

369
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We've worked with the team and this thing is now tuned.

370
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And the pod show podcast delivery network completely.

371
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
After burning nitro flame throwing network, which supports it, which is limelight.

372
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Okay, that was a rant in a half.

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's see.

374
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We've got to talk more about Madison Avenue and advertising.

375
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's what's going on this week here in New York.

376
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So first time to pay some bills in the body.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Do you believe anything is possible?

378
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
We do.

379
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Where are a flank?

380
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We believe in an internet that's safe from virus hissing scammers.

381
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We're earthlink.

382

383
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000

384
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We're earthlink.

386
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Earthlink.

387
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We revolve around you.

388
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Say, what is the sound remind you of?

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well, here I am again.

390
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And I want to tell the world.

391
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then what do you think of when you hear this theme music?

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll give you another hint.

393
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Sometimes you might hear this.

394
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And now it's time for this week.

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's 3-8-7.

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And then other times, you might hear something like this.

397
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And now it's time for Ed's software, too.

398
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Did I mention that we play pod safe music?

399
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And we even hear from the musicians.

400
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Todd Learner here.

401
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You are listening to Ed's mix music.

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Take this podcast for free.

403
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And oh, yeah.

404
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't let me forget of the podcast that's like to talk about us as well.

405
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Hi.

406
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This is Mike Tuddle from the Sky Pieces Radio podcast.

407
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's Sky Pieces Radio.com.

408
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And you're listening to all the mix.

409
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Hey, Adam Bob from the Bob show at www.bobshow.net.

410
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Where there still is no Bob show to be heard.

411
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
My career seems to be yet.

412
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So many audio feedback to your show.

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But that's okay.

414
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The reason that I'm submitting this today is,

415
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, a couple of three comments that I'd like to throw at.

416
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You're regarding Friday's show.

417
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
First of all, it was very refreshing to have your wife Patricia on the show.

418
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
She's a charming lady.

419
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And opinionated.

420
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And actually, I like that.

421
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And especially when the audience are well formed and well presented.

422
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The other thing that I like is the fact is the interaction,

423
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I guess, between you and your wife.

424
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And the interaction between you and your daughter.

425
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's really neat when you have other people on the show.

426
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think it provides a new dynamic.

427
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You don't want to tell you how to do your business.

428
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But those shows where people visit you are always the high point of the DSE stream,

429
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
if you will.

430
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I have become a DSE consumer.

431
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I've bought an iPod and I dog.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
An MM50, a San Seo came with a burp, apparently.

433
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And my most recent purchases would be this,

434
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
a high LPR50 microphone, peer 40, sorry.

435
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I like this microphone.

436
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Makes me sound better than I do in person.

437
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I've been actively promoted, but when you got it at the,

438
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
at the portable music expo and started using it,

439
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I noticed the distinct change in your sound that I really liked.

440
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So another sale for Adam Curry.

441
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Also went out and got some software.

442
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Gas blaster.

443
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
To help me, that's one of the card buttons.

444
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In the apparently, the podfather version that just came out.

445
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So that's all good.

446
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Thank you for all of that.

447
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I think you've given me a lot of inspiration and a lot of direction.

448
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But now to the point of my comments.

449
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Ultimately, I was listening to Friday's show.

450
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And you were talking about how EarthLink was going to go to a listener

451
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
based advertising generation or something like that

452
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
that you were going to have listeners creating the ads.

453
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And I think that'll be exciting looking forward to Monday's or Tuesday's show

454
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to hear about how it all shapes up.

455
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What are the things that I do want to say that EarthLink did well

456
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
was brand their sound?

457
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, the sound that EarthLink has three times in each commercial that you play.

458
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I bring this up because your burp has been disassociated from its senseo origins.

459
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What I mean by that is, you know, every time you used to burp or say senseo.

460
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I got it.

461
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I mean, it made sense.

462
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The link was there.

463
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You burped and the senseo made it happen.

464
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So you said senseo.

465
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And that was all part of the great pod casting advertising experiment.

466
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
However, when you burp, now and say stuff like

467
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
download.acview.com.

468
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It just doesn't seem to work for me.

469
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Now, I know that download.acview.com doesn't have its own sound,

470
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
but EarthLink certainly does.

471
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What if you burped and played the sound like burp?

472
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I played the wrong sound.

473
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Burp?

474
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Burp?

475
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Burp?

476
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Burp?

477
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You see what I'm going with this at him?

478
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I think they go well together.

479
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
In burp?

480
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, you've got to get a better copy of the sound, I think.

481
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But yeah, I think it'd be cool.

482
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I kind of like the idea.

483
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't know.

484
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You do with it, which you will.

485
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I want to say thanks for doing all that you do and helping me

486
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to spend my harder and money looking forward to the pod show

487
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
network coming online and seeing how that integrates with cast

488
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
blaster.

489
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I think that's going to be exciting.

490
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So thank you.

491
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And I think that may be just the thing that I need to motivate me to

492
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
actually start recording a show on a regular basis.

493
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Thanks Adam.

494
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Keep up the great work.

495
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yo, dude.

496
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you very much.

497
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I really appreciate that feedback.

498
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I want to talk about this a little bit about the sound

499
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
advertising and the Vulcan mind trick linking.

500
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But unfortunately, folks listen to this podcast on star

501
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
serious 103.

502
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We'll have to download the podcast to hear the whole thing.

503
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
PCH is next.

504
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Everybody, thanks for listening.

505
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
As we continue.

506
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I got a whole bunch of other comments about the burping.

507
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And by the way, I'm really just trying to just try to

508
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
jumble it all up and disassociate it because for all the

509
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
people who who said they liked it or

510
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
works or whatever and think it's kind of cute.

511
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
There's a lot of people who are really, really

512
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
inspired by it because they are programmed.

513
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And either I, you know, we linked you to a spot on the road,

514
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
but really with the burping thing.

515
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It was just trying to show how, you know, that you can

516
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
associate it anything with anything, I guess.

517
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Let me just give you a couple of pieces of feedback that have

518
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
come in.

519
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Billy Adams says Adam got to tell you that the reprogram isn't

520
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
working very well.

521
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Every time you burp, I immediately think Senseo actually

522
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I tend to think Senseo whenever I burp.

523
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
As you can imagine, I get several weird looks from my

524
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
friends when they hear this.

525
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But it gives me the opportunity to tell them about the

526
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Charlie.

527
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'd love it when you guys call it the Charlie.

528
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And podcasting in general.

529
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Most of them respond with the usual, I don't have an

530
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
iPod, but now of course I can send them to no iPod

531
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
required.com.

532
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Thanks to your show.

533
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It gives me a reason to get up in the morning just to

534
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
hear while I'm getting ready.

535
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Would like to ask one question though.

536
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You keep preferring to registered listeners.

537
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
How does one become a registered listener?

538
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Ah, I'm glad you asked.

539
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That'll be a part of Pod Show Plus.

540
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
This is the whole listener interface that we've been working on

541
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
so hard.

542
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I think that that's, you know, it's this month

543
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that stuff is going to start dripping out.

544
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
We're finally going to be able to show our wires.

545
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You know, now that we've got everything in place,

546
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
which is, as obviously, what took a really long time

547
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
was getting the podcast delivery network in place

548
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
that we'd have top notch.

549
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You know, I just don't want to have to worry about

550
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
bandwidth and crap and stuff not working.

551
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I want to make that, you know, that's not our expertise.

552
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Guys who really worked very hard on figuring that out.

553
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Some more Birp and Simran Sharma.

554
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Hi, Adam.

555
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
After that comment from bedtime stories.

556
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, that's when bedtime stories that a whole bunch of

557
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Birp stuff, right?

558
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Everything got real weird with me.

559
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Every time the ting in the Earthlink ad played,

560
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I hear a Birp.

561
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
God darn, there you go.

562
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You were right, dude.

563
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It was like Earthlink, Birp.

564
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Come meet our internet experts.

565
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Birp.

566
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Your info should be just that personal.

567
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Birp.

568
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Seriously, no kid in here.

569
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Your podcast rules.

570
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Thank you.

571
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What's this last one?

572
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Bob Canna.

573
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Adam, I've had enough of your birping.

574
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's very insulting that if someone burp at you.

575
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If it happens by accident, that's one thing that you're

576
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
definitely overdoing it.

577
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm no longer a listener of your show.

578
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's not worth it.

579
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
One too many birps.

580
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Grow up.

581
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Disgusted.

582
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Excellent.

583
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Ah, man.

584
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Sorry about that, Bob.

585
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The thing about the sound about the earthlink

586
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
sound branding is, of course, completely true.

587
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You know whenever you hear the intel inside sound, you know exactly what

588
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that's about.

589
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And that is, of course, something that the definitely, you know, is important.

590
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And stuff we got to think about.

591
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh, man.

592
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The jet lag is kicking in quick.

593
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Somebody saved me with some feedback.

594
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Hey, Adam, how you doing?

595
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This is push real quick.

596
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Hey, which?

597
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah, I got something to say about all this advertising.

598
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm hearing it on almost every show.

599
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You know, I have a podcast.

600
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And I totally agree with what you said yesterday on the Thursday.

601
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Got the Sierra Charlie.

602
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Somebody's going to pay me to, you know, just a little something that

603
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
was like a 15 second thing out there.

604
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I would do it.

605
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It seems like everybody that's calling up and complaining on these shows

606
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
or leaving messages and stuff like that was saying to sell it out.

607
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I mean, did it to the Gilmore gang.

608
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And, you know, I heard something on your show yesterday about it.

609
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It was like, what is this?

610
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Like, some kind of sanctuary podcasting that you can't,

611
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
can't be influenced with what a commercial here and that.

612
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Got about it personally.

613
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Is it about the podcast?

614
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I would love for someone to throw me a 30 second commercial or a 15 second

615
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
commercial.

616
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You know, there'd been like no big accomplishment to me

617
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
than having like an autonomous podcast.

618
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It pays for itself, you know.

619
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I don't have to pay a lot, you know, for my host or whatever.

620
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But still, I mean, just to have everything grown between that,

621
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
between hosting for my podcast and my website.

622
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah, it could add up a little bit, you know.

623
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So if they fill me like 30 bucks a month, I put them on every show.

624
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You know, that'd be like the ultimate compliment, like I said.

625
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It just seems like people with negative comments all the time.

626
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It just seems like the same thing with the blogosphere.

627
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If, you know, the people that write all these negative comments

628
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
or send all those negative comments about podcasting,

629
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
they don't have one.

630
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
They don't have a blog and they don't have a podcast.

631
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm talking to a lot of different new podcast.

632
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's an essence to be like a great camaraderie.

633
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And I'm all for it.

634
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
If you want to put something on your shirt and find, listen,

635
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I got like one of these fancy MP3s.

636
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Just fast forward if I don't want to hear it.

637
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You know, right?

638
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't even have to listen in.

639
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You know, like people don't listen to device shows.

640
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You know, like everything comes in.

641
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But I just wanted to say that, you know,

642
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
your show, you do what you want.

643
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
My show, I do what I want.

644
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And, uh, right, I'm right.

645
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
People don't like it.

646
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But that's fine.

647
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
There's 6.4 billion people that don't listen to my show right now.

648
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So you can be wonderful.

649
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's no big deal, you know.

650
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I just can't join anyway.

651
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm just going to keep listening and enjoy your show.

652
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Take care.

653
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Bye bye.

654
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Hey, which, thank you man.

655
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I like that.

656
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That was really funny.

657
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You made me, I heard it three times already,

658
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and it still may be live.

659
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'll do you one better, man.

660
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
For this earthling thing,

661
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
let's, um,

662
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
we should do like,

663
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
uh,

664
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
maybe I just call it a contest.

665
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Why don't we, um,

666
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
do a contest.

667
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And, uh,

668
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
you know,

669
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
create the earthling ad.

670
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And of course, the, all the,

671
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the fun is playing the submissions, right?

672
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Which all work as, uh,

673
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
as commercials.

674
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And, uh,

675
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and then we choose one.

676
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And then the winner gets some fabulous prize.

677
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I don't know what the prize is yet,

678
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
but, um,

679
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
something like that.

680
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Something we should definitely,

681
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I mean, that's, that's,

682
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
um,

683
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I haven't really had a chance to hook up with the,

684
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
with the,

685
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
the sales and biz dev team to discuss it.

686
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But when we've had some email back and forth,

687
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
so I know that this is what we're going to do.

688
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Um,

689
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
but I,

690
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't have details like,

691
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
you know,

692
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
if we do this,

693
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
we know what kind of prize we'd have.

694
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But it will,

695
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
we'll figure something out.

696
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We'll figure something out.

697
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It will totally make it worthwhile.

698
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Um,

699
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
so start thinking about it.

700
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So thinking about,

701
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
you know,

702
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
you know,

703
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the ultimate podcasting earthling ad.

704
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Everyone's got tools.

705
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And, you know,

706
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
this is not going to be about how will you produce something.

707
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's going to be about the message, right?

708
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Here's our opportunity.

709
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Here's the chance to show how it really works,

710
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
how a community,

711
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
um,

712
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
how a community integrates marketing and advertising.

713
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Let's try it.

714
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
This is,

715
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and this community, by the way,

716
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
is the daily source code community.

717
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So I'm,

718
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm looking forward to the members of this active community to join in.

719
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And then maybe you can spread some love to other communities.

720
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh my gosh,

721
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
even like the Gilmour Gang.

722
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
From Westport,

723
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Connecticut.

724
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Bringing you the juice.

725
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's across the sound.

726
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The new marketing podcast.

727
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
With your host,

728
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Joseph,

729
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Jeffy.

730
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You've just entered the no bullshit zone.

731
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Hey, Adam,

732
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
it's Jeffy here.

733
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I've got two statements and a question for you.

734
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Here's the first statement.

735
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Uh,

736
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
was very intrigued with the whole Howard Stern,

737
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Randon Ramble about,

738
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
uh,

739
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Dissing podcasting,

740
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
basically what?

741
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
A load of crap.

742
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Here's the one thing that I was thinking about.

743
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
His whole mission,

744
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that basically podcasting,

745
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
will never be what radio is because of the live.

746
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
In fact,

747
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and I was thinking of myself,

748
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
how long will it be

749
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
before iPods have some kind of Wi-Fi

750
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and some kind of Skype or VoiceOver IP functionality

751
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
that ultimately will allow pod costs to be downloaded near live

752
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and eventually with some kind of streaming capability

753
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
to be downloaded and streamed and even produced live.

754
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That has got to be coming down the pike

755
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
sooner rather than later.

756
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So that's comment number one.

757
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Okay.

758
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Actually,

759
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm going to just jump in here

760
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
because otherwise I know I'll forget the first comment.

761
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So it's two comments and a question.

762
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Across the sound,

763
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
it's a good podcast,

764
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
by the way,

765
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
if you're interested in the stuff that we're talking about.

766
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You know,

767
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
this is changing advertising,

768
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
etc, etc.

769
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Um,

770
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
what the hell was your question again?

771
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What was this comment?

772
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I wanted to say something about it.

773
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh my god,

774
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
this is horrible.

775
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm kind of streaming capable.

776
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh yes,

777
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
to be downloaded and streamed and even produced live.

778
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That has got to be coming down the pike sooner rather than later.

779
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So that's comment number one.

780
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So,

781
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
yes,

782
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I totally believe that.

783
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And we will soon.

784
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And with soon,

785
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I've learned to say five years from now.

786
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
We will live in a completely connected world.

787
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm totally with Steve Gilmore on this one.

788
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Um,

789
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
you'll be able to connect any device to the network.

790
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Anywhere,

791
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
anytime.

792
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We can already do it on certain

793
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
airlines as broadband connectivity.

794
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So the idea of actually storing stuff

795
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
on your computer will,

796
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
you know,

797
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
we'll kind of be outdated or storing stuff anywhere.

798
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Um,

799
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
and it's not like,

800
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
you'll just be able to download this stuff and just listen to it in real time.

801
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
The economics will be there.

802
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Um,

803
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
the infrastructure will be there, which of course means the economics will be there.

804
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Um,

805
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and everything will just be connected.

806
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It would whether it's through edge or EVDO or UMTS,

807
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
or, uh,

808
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Y-max or Y-Fi or whatever it is,

809
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
it's going to be completely connected world.

810
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
We'll just be able to connect anything

811
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
anybody anytime anywhere.

812
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And that is totally happening.

813
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And so,

814
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
yeah,

815
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I think we could probably easily predict that there will be handheld devices.

816
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Um,

817
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
the first versions of course will be cell phones that have MP3 capability.

818
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And they're going to turn it around.

819
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And there will be boxes that don't even have a phone built into it.

820
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But we'll have high, high bandwidth connectivity to the network.

821
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And then be able to access,

822
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
you know, your,

823
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
your,

824
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
your stored stuff somewhere and whether it's stored on your own server or your own space or someone else is,

825
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
you'll just be able to access it.

826
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And it really will be the,

827
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I truly believe that that,

828
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
that that will happen and that we won't have a need for,

829
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
um,

830
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
creating copies of all of this stuff before we can,

831
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and then before we can play it.

832
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So that's just my feedback on comment number one.

833
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Comment number two,

834
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
uh,

835
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I've been blocking about this whole notion of podfading and about burnout both on the side of production,

836
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
as well as consumption.

837
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And I actually went and created the term in wiki pedia.

838
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But for some reason,

839
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
the term was challenged as self-professed,

840
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
near,

841
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
near,

842
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
nearology,

843
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
near,

844
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
whatever.

845
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And, uh,

846
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and it was actually deleted and I just wanted what you thought about that,

847
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
why that would have been called self-professed,

848
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
nearology.

849
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
To me.

850
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What?

851
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That just seemed very, very suspect,

852
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and I wonder who had a problem with that term being coined.

853
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So that's statement number two.

854
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Dude,

855
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
you're asking me about wiki pedia.

856
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm not the right guy to ask.

857
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I can't,

858
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
you know,

859
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I was editing stuff that was getting deleted as I was writing it.

860
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But anyway,

861
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
if you look at podcasting now,

862
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
wiki pedia,

863
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
it turns out Tristan Lewis has discovered all this stuff.

864
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He's the first name that pops up at the top.

865
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'd never heard of Tristan Lewis in my life.

866
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Here's a question for you.

867
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I think you know what I'm going to say.

868
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Cast Blaster and Skype.

869
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
How long before we see some kind of integration and capability and all patch,

870
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
because I think that when you do that,

871
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
we're going to have a phenomenal product that ultimately

872
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
becomes the gold standard.

873
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
At least from a PC standpoint,

874
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
in terms of facilitating and enabling any pod costs

875
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
that has a dialogue going in terms of an interview or co-host type format.

876
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So anyway,

877
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
those are the two statements and questions.

878
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Thanks so much.

879
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Keep up the good works,

880
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and I will see you across the sound.

881
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
All right, buddy.

882
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah, this is,

883
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
so there's an issue there,

884
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
is that it really has to come from Skype's end,

885
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
because we have to be able to split the,

886
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm just using layman's term here.

887
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
We have to be able to split the internal audio stream.

888
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So these are the streams that run through the CPU

889
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and the digital sound processor,

890
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
whatever,

891
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to be able to do that,

892
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
so you don't get this horrible echo and feedback stuff

893
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
to be able to integrate it with Cast Blaster.

894
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Now there are other applications and other vendors of applications

895
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that we've been talking to,

896
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
who will essentially allow the same thing,

897
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and who will work with us on opening up the streams

898
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
into Cast Blaster,

899
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and they will have dialogue,

900
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
like a Skype out functionality,

901
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
but it's not Skype.

902
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So, you know,

903
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
the part of the beautiful thing of Skype is,

904
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
it's Skype, you know,

905
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and you can just,

906
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
everyone has Skype or most people have Skype

907
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and it's kind of become a podcaster thing.

908
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So these other clients,

909
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
it will be the same thing,

910
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
it will be free and you'll be able to download it

911
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and you know,

912
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm trying to,

913
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
it will be great to have something integrated into Cast Blaster.

914
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And maybe that's,

915
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
maybe that's the answer,

916
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
you know,

917
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
to have some of these other clients integrated into Cast Blaster,

918
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
but it is a problem.

919
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Now the way I've solved it,

920
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and I haven't actually used that,

921
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
but I will in a show in the near future,

922
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
you know,

923
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I have this laptop and I have two sound cards.

924
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Now if you have two sound cards,

925
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
then you can always route Skype

926
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and separate sound card.

927
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And of course I also use an external mixer,

928
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
then you can kind of all patch it together,

929
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
but not internally in Cast Blaster right now,

930
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and that's really just a matter of,

931
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
you know,

932
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
not that Skype didn't want to do it.

933
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
In fact,

934
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Skype was,

935
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
we talked to the Cast Blaster,

936
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Mike and I talked to some of the dev guys

937
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and were the hell were they in,

938
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
not least the way any.

939
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Was it Lithuania?

940
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
A lot of you.

941
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Shoot, I can't remember.

942
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Now but then the whole eBay purchase

943
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
came down and everyone,

944
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
it all kind of like fell apart.

945
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So that's kind of unfortunate.

946
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
We'll try and start that up again,

947
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
but I don't know if everything's kind of shaken

948
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
out over there yet.

949
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
All right.

950
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
One more comment,

951
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
then a piece from a podcast,

952
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I want you to hear,

953
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I love this podcast so much,

954
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and then one more podcast,

955
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
safe song,

956
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and then a matter here,

957
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
because work to do,

958
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
work to do.

959
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Hey,

960
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
this is the podcast I'm from Zilkost.

961
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And Megan from the Sheep to your podcast.

962
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And we've got some ideas for you, Adam.

963
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Firstly,

964
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I think that we should forget all the vlogging,

965
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
the video podcasting,

966
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and only have a silly names,

967
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and come up with one.

968
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Recasting.

969
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And I think on the podcast,

970
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
music network,

971
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
there should be a remember me button under the login spot,

972
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
because sometimes I'll just get logged out randomly,

973
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and if we ever return to the homepage,

974
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
we get logged out.

975
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So I find a song that I like,

976
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
but then I'm not logged in,

977
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
so I can't add it to my playlist.

978
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
These are our ideas.

979
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Our websites are Zolv.com,

980
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and Sheep to you.blogspot.com,

981
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
spelled SHEP,

982
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
the number two EWE.blogspot.com.

983
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Thanks, Adam.

984
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
All right, guys.

985
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
All right, bye.

986
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Thank you very much.

987
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Okay, so,

988
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
V casting.

989
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, maybe.

990
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't know.

991
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I just like to take a video podcast,

992
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
that just kind of works better for me.

993
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Now, about the remember me button,

994
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
you are so right about that,

995
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
that bites so much ass.

996
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yes.

997
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That was number one on the list of things.

998
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And you're going to see lots of changes coming

999
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
with the pod save music network.

1000
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
One of them will be that your login

1001
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
at the pod save music network

1002
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
will stay persistent,

1003
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
so you don't have to keep logging in.

1004
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You can, you do the whole remember me thing,

1005
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
that'll work for purchases,

1006
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
as well on the pod save music network.

1007
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And we're also merging it.

1008
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So, you'll have one sign on it,

1009
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
pod cast alley,

1010
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
same thing for pod show plus,

1011
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
same thing for the pod cast delivery network.

1012
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So, yeah,

1013
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that's just a little bit of program,

1014
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
well, not a little bit of programming.

1015
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So, major programming that had to take place

1016
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to kind of integrate all those pieces.

1017
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But that will be part of one of the many,

1018
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
many things that we've been working on.

1019
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Now, I don't know if you heard the latest pod finder.

1020
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh, it actually, yeah,

1021
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
you can find that in the iTunes pod cast directory.

1022
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And we feature a pod cast on it

1023
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that I thought was just so funny.

1024
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I love this pod cast,

1025
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
that I wanted to play the same clip for you.

1026
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's just two minutes.

1027
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's all about customer service.

1028
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And, you know, you've heard the stories,

1029
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
you've heard the,

1030
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm sure you've heard recordings before

1031
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
of wacky customer service.

1032
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But to hear this on the podcast,

1033
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and service,

1034
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but to hear this on a serialized basis,

1035
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and hear it all the time,

1036
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
it just makes you feel so good about,

1037
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
you know,

1038
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
not being the only one that has to go through this crap.

1039
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
My PC freezes up,

1040
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
so let's give our buddies over to Delicol

1041
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and see what we can find out.

1042
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
What the,

1043
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
what the numbers are.

1044
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Anyway, let's see what we get.

1045
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Welcome to Delicol.

1046
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Here we go.

1047
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Here we go.

1048
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Here we go.

1049
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And please press one.

1050
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
To make a purchase,

get pricing information,

1052
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
or complete an online order.

1053
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
No, I just want to do money.

1054
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
For technical support,

1055
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
or for software and technical questions,

1056
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
press three.

1057
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
For all other issues related to a purchase,

1058
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
already made.

1059
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Press four.

1060
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Let's try three.

1061
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Technical support.

1062
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Let me ask you a few questions,

1063
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
so I can get you to the right technical support

1064
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
represented.

1065
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
All right.

1066
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
This new system,

1067
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
you can use your voice to respond

1068
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
rather than pressing buttons on your phone.

1069
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Feel free to interrupt me at any time

1070
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
when you know what to say.

1071
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Okay.

1072
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And if you ever get stuck,

1073
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
just say help or repeat that.

1074
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Okay?

1075
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Let's get started.

1076
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Okay.

1077
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Are you calling to check

1078
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
on the status of a service request?

1079
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Please say yes or no.

1080
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
No.

1081
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Sorry,

1082
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I didn't hear you.

1083
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
No.

1084
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
If you've made a service request,

1085
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and you're calling to find out

1086
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
when the status.

1087
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
All right.

1088
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Are you calling about a product

1089
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
that has the Del logo on it?

1090
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yes.

1091
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Please say or enter

or say, help me find it.

1094
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Help me find it.

1095
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Sure.

1096
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
First tell me what product you're calling about.

1097
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You can say the Del product name like Dimension,

1098
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
or something general such as Desktop or Printer.

1099
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Okay?

1100
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Go ahead.

1101
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
PC.

1102
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Sorry.

1103
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I didn't understand.

1104
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
PC.

1105
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
A DVD drive.

1106
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Is that correct?

1107
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
No.

1108
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Talk about service.

1109
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Talk about service is the name of the podcast.

1110
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's full of gems like that.

1111
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You know, the world that we live in.

1112
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
This could be.

1113
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It could be goes so far beyond customer service.

1114
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I mean, just the automated.

1115
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Messed up world we live in.

1116
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It just fits.

1117
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's beautiful.

1118
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Okay.

1119
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Last piece of pod save music.

1120
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
For my buddy Chris Rockwell,

1121
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
who's been been working so hard on getting the pod save music network ready to.

1122
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
To launch with with our sales and my gosh.

1123
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I mean, he's not the only one.

1124
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But I just wanted to highlight Chris because.

1125
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Well, shoot.

1126
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I got a song for him.

1127
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So here's a stucky and Murray.

1128
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm feel free to sing along.

1129
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Some people go on smoke breaks.

1130
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Others serve the web.

1131
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Some people get up and grab a coffee.

1132
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But I'm not one of them.

1133
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't like being a net.

1134
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
All I smoke is grass.

1135
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I prefer to spend my time sitting on my skinny white ass.

1136
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I've been some life's all around the room.

1137
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Just right before I start.

1138
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Sometimes I'm in there for 30 minutes.

1139
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And all I do is fart.

1140
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So if the facts machines on the fritz.

1141
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And that'll cop here's going berserk.

1142
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Don't ask me to play Mr. Repairman.

1143
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
When I'm taking a dump at work.

1144
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Or I'm taking a dump.

1145
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm taking a dump.

1146
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm taking a dump at work.

1147
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But don't bother me.

1148
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You can't just see him.

1149
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Just a taking a dump at work.

1150
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I go in and ride 11 o'clock.

1151
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I go back in after lunch.

1152
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Every time it comes out right on the dime.

1153
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And it looks like a nestly crunch.

1154
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And I'm afraid to use the journey.

1155
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But that's all in my floor.

1156
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
There'll be a 10 minute layover.

1157
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Before I really want you to open the door.

1158
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I've been he's been taking a dump.

1159
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'm taking a dump.

1160
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm taking a dump at work.

1161
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But don't bother me.

1162
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You can't just see him.

1163
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Just a taking a dump at work.

1164
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And if I'm not at my disc.

1165
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And I'll be on the porcelain throne.

1166
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'll waste my day on the crapper.

1167
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Until it's time to go home.

1168
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I don't talk to me through the storm.

1169
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And you break my concentration.

1170
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The last thing that I need right now is a case of constipation.

1171
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And I'm a fan of the courtesy flush.

1172
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I like my ass tape of three-plot thick.

1173
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You know I sat on the shit of this afternoon.

1174
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And red male bills won't be dick.

1175
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Twice.

1176
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So you can call me Ishmael bitch when I'm taking a dump.

1177
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But taking a dump.

1178
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But taking a dump at work.

1179
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I don't bother me.

1180
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You can't just see him.

1181
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Just a taking a dump at work.

1182
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I don't care if the boss is looking.

1183
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I don't care if the phone is ringing.

1184
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I'll be in here dropping the news.

1185
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And you'll probably hear me singing.

1186
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Then I'll take a dump.

1187
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But taking a dump.

1188
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But taking a dump at work.

You can't just see him.
