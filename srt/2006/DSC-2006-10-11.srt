00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
For the first time ever, the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in one action-packed DVD collection,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You've flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,320
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,360
Available now on DVD.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,400
Delta Sierra Charlie 476, scruncher!

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,880
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,000
30 minutes?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,720
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,560
We don't need not sticking 30 minutes.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,160
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,560
Oh, I guessed it, it's an angry curry.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,960
It's like I picked the wrong week when I'm fed of each.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,080
Welliffu!

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Every one's in my room...

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,880
...legshirt, Laink, and so the boys.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,200
And everybody with sameake still isn't right.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,080
As the customers are down above.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,000
How I know what to be Vocalist now.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,160
Bye, colos, tutorial!

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Hey, you don't tell me if it's your size

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,160
I'm just too old around

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
I'm just too old around

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm just too lazy to take your side

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm just too old around

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm just too old around

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:11,160
Every one said I'm just too old

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
It's just too old just in time

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm just too old around

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,160
I'm just too old around

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Every one said I'm just too old

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,160
It's just too old just in time

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm just too old around

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,160
I'm just too old around

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Every one said I'm just too old around

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm just too old around

39
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,160
I'm just too old around

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
I'm just too old around

41
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm just too old around

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
I'm just too old around

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm just too old around

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm just too old around

45
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:46,120
This song is exactly how my head feels right now.

46
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:55,320
The other side, hey you kicking off episode number 476 of the daily source code coming

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,480
you from Northern California from Curricondo.

48
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,520
It is the Chacha, hey everybody, how are you doing?

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,880
As you can hear, I've got more equipment here.

50
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,120
You hear a little bit of it, I don't want to reduce that reverb just a little bit.

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,360
Yeah, yeah, I found a mixer at Pod Show HQ, audio mixer, and so I stole that.

52
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,600
It's not that nice sound, well actually, I don't think anything can really help the way

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,880
I sound because this is the way I sound.

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,160
Yeah, I've been snorting this blend of people.

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
Oh man, did I really get hit by some kind of bug really, really bad?

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
And of course it came at, you know, the perfect timing is when we had all that crap going on

57
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,160
for the past, was it 36 hours of PodShow.com being down and then the site's being up

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
and the media files not being delivered.

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
There's really only one thing I can say about it.

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,800
There are three people responsible for this mess, which is now as far as I can tell.

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
And so right now we're Wednesday, we're hump day.

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,320
It's not even 6 a.m. and I'm cracking it here at the condo.

63
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,520
It's still dark outside.

64
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm at the Baker's Rack Studio.

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,200
Now there's really only three people who are responsible.

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Ron Bloom, Adam Curry, and Bart Parsons, the CEO of GoDaddy,

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
because there's no one specific reason why this went wrong.

68
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,400
We have a partnership with GoDaddy as we do with the limelight network.

69
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,880
It's all part of the podcast delivery network and we ported hundreds of domains over from

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
other places like network solutions and just all the stuff that we had registered all over to GoDaddy.

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,920
And until we're really big account and GoDaddy's aware of it and of course we know how to

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
set an auto and renew option.

73
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,920
You know, we're not totally stupid, but we have a specialist account and things just went wrong.

74
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:52,080
And of course there's no reason for us to let GoDaddy to let that happen to one of their

75
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,360
bigger clients.

76
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:01,120
So shame on all of us and on behalf of the three of us and certainly on my path, I apologize.

77
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,160
Really, really apologize to our thousands of podcast delivery network users.

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,320
And of course, to the millions of listeners who use Pod Show.

79
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,360
So hopefully, hopefully this won't happen again, oh man, that was so painful.

80
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,080
And then I got hit with this, and I'm sure it has something to do with it.

81
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
I got hit with this bug, man.

82
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,680
It's just, you know, my nose has just been like Niagara Falls.

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,320
I was up at four this morning, because my body was telling me, hey, you got to take care of some business.

84
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,120
So I have a nice cup of Earl Grey tea here, huh?

85
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,800
Earl Grey, of course, you only want that with lemon, not with any milk, because that really tastes like crap.

86
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,320
And luckily, you guys are going to pull me through this today, because you've been sending me all kinds of

87
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,760
really cool stuff to talk about and to play. So let's get things underway here.

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,680
Hey Adam, this is John. I just want to thank you for turning over me on to Dave Appalito,

89
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,960
and that guitarman.com, room of girls, Angie Gay, and all that stuff, but especially that guitarman.com.

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,600
It's, uh, it's just great, and uh, keep up your good work, and enjoy your show everyday.

91
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,000
I listen to you and, uh, David, um, religiously, almost, um, like get very depressed when you

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
win the guys on honor, don't get a show on her, that's problem. So keep getting those shows out.

93
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,160
Thank you very much, and, of course, I'm a folder with a little scrunch tendency. All right,

94
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,960
you take care, man, and have a great week. All right, bye.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
All right, dude, thank you. Yeah, I think, uh, I think we got David on the network now.

96
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm, it's all this crap that was going on. It was kind of hard to keep track of a lot of things,

97
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,960
because email, of course, also broke. And now, what is this with, with, um, with, is everyone

98
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,240
getting these mortgage company and loan things, uh, on email? It seems rampant all of a sudden.

99
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,120
I would just get, you know, and, and they have an old New York address, and they use that in the

100
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,640
subject line, and, and then it's like, you know, uh, your shit's being repossessed. It's just a lot of

101
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,080
that spam coming in. I can't seem to get rid of it. Some about that scruncher of folder thing, though.

102
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,800
I've noticed that, of course, I am a world renowned folder, but when I blow my nose,

103
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,920
and, and, and it's, I've noticed this several times over the past, uh, you know, 24 hours,

104
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm a scruncher. I do not, I, I just grab the paper and I just scrunched around my shnaz and I blow.

105
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,880
And I'm wondering, why is that? Why don't I fold? It's, um, I mean, obviously it's a very different type of

106
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,320
crap us that were, uh, that were taken care of here, but, um, I just thought I'd point that out.

107
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
And, of course, it gives me another reason to play this.

108
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Hey Adam, it's Karla from theroomagirls.com. Um, just responding to last Friday show when you said

109
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,960
that you bet that I was a scruncher. And you're right, I am. Um, and Karen was a folder and she claims to be a

110
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,040
folder. But one night, as girls often do, we went to the ladies room together at our local pub.

111
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,040
Wait a minute, I just want to get a visual. Don't go too fast with the story.

112
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,040
Okay, Carolyn Carla and the ladies room together. As girls often do, um, reliably informed.

113
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,240
And I found out that she is by, all right, we're sisters, get your mind out of the gutter.

114
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Anyway, yeah, she claims to be the perfect girl next door folder, but he really is by.

115
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,080
She does it both. Anyway, it had a blast at the ex-girls. Thanks for all the parts your swag.

116
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:49,120
Cheers, bye. Yeah, thanks, girls. She is the, uh, all-American girl next door.

117
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,440
They both are. And it's nice to have a combo, you know, to have a scruncher and a folder in the, in the,

118
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,680
in the mixed, that's cool. And lots of people on vacation, still calling it into the Charlie.

119
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,080
Hi Adam, this is Franco from Roca hospital. Did you ever receive a voice message from the

120
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,200
multiviland? Well, here it is. I'm here doing a great vacation at both trip and the

121
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,480
multis. Doing some great surf, just relaxing, eating fish, drinking beer and listening to the Charlie.

122
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,280
What a great, great trip. Take care and say a lot to all Charlie listeners. Bye.

123
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,240
Hi, Franco. Thank you, dude. Calling in from the Maldives. No, have not had a call from the Maldives,

124
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,880
yeah, Franco from Roca, Stitalia. Of course, amidst all of this crap, which seemed very significant

125
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,920
to us and to others, you know, there's a lot going on in the world. Pretty amazing that North Korea

126
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,600
claims to have set off a new, underground, new thing. And I have had my eye on the TV quite a bit

127
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,760
and, and on different websites, obviously, trying to get some more information on the news. And

128
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,240
when I'm waiting for is this size, the size of a graphic results, you know, that actually,

129
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,440
because North Korea says, we fired up a new, underground, okay, but are there ways to measure that?

130
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,240
Maybe I've missed it, but it's certainly what, you know, all I saw is like both CNN and Fox News,

131
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,440
this sense sale moment brought to you by Splenda. Mix the two together for a great new high.

132
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:29,200
You know, both CNN and Fox News, you know, were reporting on the news and what they kept

133
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,400
showing was, you know, like missiles going off, you know, just a continuous loop of missiles firing

134
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,240
into the air. Dude, it was an underground explosion. It was a totally blown out of proportion

135
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,520
image for what took place. He's, he's no notice of default for 11 West 42nd Street. That's

136
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,400
shit, just keeps him in. That's my old address. That's from, what does it, 14 years ago?

137
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,480
Anyway, so if anyone has has a pointer or a web link where there's some actual size,

138
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,680
a graphic, is that the word size, a graphic results or tests or graphs that we can see that they

139
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,720
actually did fire up a new guy, I'd love to see that, just to know for sure. And, you know,

140
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,320
as fate would have it, of course, I've been promising you an Uncle Don conversation,

141
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,720
my Uncle Don who worked with a Bush senior as his personal advisor. I think our security advisor

142
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:30,400
worked at the CIA. I mean, he's a lifetime career politician, does not like the current

143
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,840
administration at all. And although he is, as far as I know, he's still a Republican. And he was also

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,120
ambassador, South Korea. So as fate would have it, he and his lovely wife, Meg, Aunt Meg,

145
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,200
are traveling in Europe. And they're actually going to be, they are leaving, they're circling

146
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,520
around and leaving for, couldn't you? They wanted to see my sister. They're leaving from Amsterdam

147
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,920
on, I think, the 22nd. And I actually arrive in the UK on the 22nd. So I was like, oh, I'm going

148
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,160
to be in New York next week for some, for some meetings. And it would have been perfect to go and

149
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,520
hang out with them. So I just don't want to do it on the phone. You know, I just really,

150
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,720
I really like to do it face to face to, you know, to get a really good long sit down session with them.

151
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,200
So if the world doesn't blow up, hopefully I'll be able to do it in about five weeks or so

152
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,960
when I get back. People are definitely listening to the Charlie. And when their name is called,

153
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:33,280
they do respond. The view outside my window is of a clear blue sky and a deep blue ocean.

154
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,360
But it's not the view from my office in Abu Dhabi where I remain a regular listener of the Charlie.

155
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,920
Instead of be a radiant ghost, I have before me the Mediterranean,

156
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,480
seen from my hotel room in Can, on the front of the era. Twice a year, my job requires me to attend

157
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,320
the International Television Program Market to acquire content for the TV channel we operate in the Middle

158
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,760
East. But I wonder how many of the media professionals here in Can this week

159
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,240
fully devised as I do. But very soon, even television people will be shouting,

160
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,880
we don't need no fucking transmitters. I thought for the day from Malcolm soon back home again

161
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,920
in Abu Dhabi. Thank you very much Malcolm from Abu Dhabi. In Con France,

162
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,360
living up the high life, is that the, uh, medium? Uh, that is that? Yeah, it's the big, big, big

163
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,920
conference. Malcolm, I really appreciate you calling in and just letting us know that you're okay.

164
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,320
Your voice, man, you know, you could call me all day. I could listen to that. It's so beautiful.

165
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,120
Really, really is safe travels back to Abu Dhabi. And keep us, uh, keep us updated on what's going on.

166
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,360
I'd love to, you know, hear what you really, you know, what the vibe was in, in Con at the, uh,

167
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,360
at the festival. Well, it's not really festival. It's where all the deals are done. It's where

168
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,800
all of the people who make television programming go to sell their shit and they sell it to

169
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,680
as many channels as they can and big deals are done and it's champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

170
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,720
Malcolm, let us know. And of course, lots of blow and hookers, right?

171
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,200
Adam A, man, it's Jay Mac again from putite.com. Hey, I wanted to, uh, drive you quick message,

172
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,240
Howard Stern was talking about to this morning, man. He was saying, um, he listened to Jay

173
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,840
Thomas on, on serious stars. And he also listens to that to that iPod guy, the old NTV DJ is what he said.

174
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,280
So hey, man, we should know Howard's to it. So there you go, man. That's it. Um,

175
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,960
Dr. Waiter, man. Dude, Jim Mac, thank you so much, dude. That really makes my day.

176
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:49,520
Yeah, you have no idea. Yeah, um, I have, there's two, um, two heroes of wrong word, but there's

177
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,600
two guys in radio that I have, that have influenced me tremendously. The first, uh, from like 1980,

178
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,680
81 was Scott Shannon, uh, who was in New York and, um, took Z100, W HTZ from, uh, worst to first

179
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,760
in the market. And it was, and I was doing radio at the time in Holland, and it was so new,

180
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,960
so different what he was doing. He was really directing this morning show with multiple personalities

181
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,360
and pre-produced bits. And it's something that had never been done before. And it was just fantastic.

182
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,240
You know, even though we laugh about it now, shit, who's calling me this early? Go away.

183
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,120
You know, we laugh about all the rim shots and the cowbell stuff now. Uh, of course,

184
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,400
you know, I still use the cowbell, but he was a tremendous influence. And, um, and I was fortunate

185
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,280
to work with him, um, in the, uh, in the late 80s, just as, you know, the whole format of like a

186
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,080
morning zoo was starting to become very stale and, and just lame. Um, and we still, uh, email with each

187
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:57,040
other. Uh, and he's, uh, still, um, running WPLG, not PLJ, 95.5 in, uh, in New York. And so around, uh,

188
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,200
the time when I actually came to New York in 87. And, uh, and, uh, and I was still very high on, uh,

189
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,440
on what Scott Shannon was doing, you know, Howard Stern had just kind of risen to the top and was

190
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,000
kicking everyone's ass in the ratings. And, what Howard Stern was doing, it just blew me away.

191
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm like, I can't listen. This is fantastic. This guy is just talking, just speaking his mind. He's not

192
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,440
rushing. You know, it's, uh, sometimes he has a band that he plays some music, but you know,

193
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,800
miss it. It's just, it's open and honest. And I loved it so much. And I so desperately wanted to

194
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,800
emulate what he was doing, um, no way you can do that on Z100. Although I tried to do it a little bit,

195
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,360
you know, I did the morning show for a couple of months, but the format, even the processing,

196
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,520
the sound of that station doesn't really allow for the room to breathe and for you just to talk

197
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,240
slowly and calmly and have some fun and let the room breathe is really what I'm talking about.

198
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,760
It was just something Scott Shannon used to say as well. Um, and an MTV, you know, I really,

199
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,320
I, I love trying to just be honest and and say the stuff that I felt. And because it wasn't live,

200
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,640
you know, all that good shit, I told you all the good shit on MTV never made it to the air.

201
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,920
And I was like, well, you can't say that because that might offend someone or, you know,

202
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,560
that person won't come on the video, music awards was so fucking political. So, um, how it was

203
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,360
a tremendous influence on me, um, and, and totally drove me, I think, to creating the type of show

204
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,240
that I'm creating today, uh, just by listening to and enjoying what he's been doing. So the hat,

205
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,200
to know that he's actually listening, even if it calls me the Big Hared Fag X MTV VGA iPod guy,

206
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,840
I'll take it. I really will. I'm very, very happy. No shit.

207
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,440
No, let me do one of these. Hi, this is Brent with Potts Show Radio. 7, 14, 81,

208
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:57,280
2, 63, 99, 348, 769. Now, what was the third number I named off?

209
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
You don't remember, do you? I do. That's kind of like what it's like being an artist thrown

210
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,480
in with a lot of other artists on the show. By the time the show is over, chances are,

211
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,640
you don't remember who they are. Here on Potts Show Radio, we featured the hottest potstate

212
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,720
bands on the planet. In each week, we dedicated an entire podcast. There's just one artist.

213
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,160
So when you're done with the show, you will know more about them than they know about themselves.

214
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:38,240
Give us a try. PottsShowRadio.com. 81. I'll just save you the trouble of rewinding. It was 81

215
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,600
was the third number. I got to think about numbers. I'm really good at remembering those.

216
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,280
PottsShowRadio.com. See, what do we have here? I got the satellite window closing and just a little bit.

217
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:58,000
A lot of people called in about, about what I was talking about, B.T. PottsShow and PottsShow

218
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,840
in the UK and what PottsShow would be doing in Ireland. And I did make a rather large snafu

219
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,920
by basically something like an American idiot saying that the Ireland is a part of the UK.

220
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,040
What I meant really is that Ireland is a part of B.T.s market. Now, let me just,

221
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
let me just go back and say, when we fully launch, which is coming up in,

222
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
what is it? Less than three weeks now.

223
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,640
We fully launch B.T. PottsShow in the UK. It'll be available worldwide. I mean, you can go to

224
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,240
B.T. PottsShow.com from Japan, you know, not a problem. But obviously, what we have on the home page

225
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,960
will be surfacing there, the top results in search. It'll be UK centric. That's the whole point.

226
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:50,480
It's like going to google.co.uk. Excuse me. I'm not, I'm not going to say it.

227
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,800
Now, the part of the deal with B.T. PottsShow is that, you know, we're going to use their marketing

228
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,080
muscle. You can imagine if you just look at the television in the UK, how much money B.T. spends

229
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:11,280
on advertising, on print advertising, television advertising, radio advertising, advertising in the

230
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,640
tube, advertising on the ceiling. They advertise everywhere. So, you know, one of the big reasons for

231
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,400
this partnership is, you know, to take advantage of that. And so, we will be wherever B.T.

232
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,320
Markets, wherever that. Fuck is that. Someone call me and let's go away.

233
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,960
Crap, how many of you freaked out when you heard that, huh? Go on. Oh, shit. My Skype is ringing.

234
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,880
Sorry about that. So, anywhere that B.T. has marketing, B.T. PottsShow.com will be marketed there as

235
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,960
well. And as far as I know, Ireland is a part of the mix. Hi, Adam. This is Gabriel here. I'm from

236
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,880
Dublin, Ireland. And I was just thinking to D.S.C. 474, where you had to call from Tanya there,

237
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,600
asking whether B.T. PottsShow was going to be willing at services in Ireland. And I noticed that you

238
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:11,840
got a little confused with the why she saw this B.T. wouldn't be involved in bringing

239
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,520
pod shows, Ireland. And I wasn't quite sure why you were confused about that. And so,

240
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,000
I looked at your website and I see how you've got an a little line there explaining how

241
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:36,960
you're explaining that B.T. PottsShow is in the UK. All of the UK. Just to explain,

242
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,040
I understand that you haven't been in the UK for a long time. Just to explain, the

243
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,320
public environment isn't actually in the UK. It's a totally separate independent country.

244
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,960
Gernsey, like you mentioned there, is a dependency of the Arctic Kingdom, but there are public

245
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,920
environment isn't. B.T. is only been in Ireland since about the 90s when it took over some

246
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,840
Irish telecom companies. But it's not actually the Irish division is quite separate. So,

247
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,400
I don't know, there's a fair point there. Just so, you know, folder.

248
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,360
Thank you. I would have picked you as a scruncher, actually, but I appreciate you coming clean

249
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,720
on being a folder. Okay, you know what? I'm even more confused now after listening to that, but

250
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,600
yes, B.T. PottsShow will also have a marketing presence in Ireland. That's because, you know,

251
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,200
they're there. So, it's all a part of their bigger vision, which literally is called B.T. Vision

252
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,960
interestingly enough. I do not want to forget to thank all an engineering and actually,

253
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,280
just about everyone at Pod Show for the past two days. You know, we had some crap come down.

254
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:01,920
It affected everyone. You can imagine if we're not serving shows, besides listeners, producers,

255
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,240
podcasters, there's advertisers. There's so many different things that come into play.

256
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
And it was a great fire drill. And it was nice to see, you know, the team really pulled together.

257
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,040
Everyone work on this. I think Richard Brueher, hey, and Joe Carpenter called hundreds of people

258
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,080
sent out emails, really did everything we could. And that's about the best we can do.

259
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,680
But really, really appreciate everyone's pulling together and making it. It's just nice,

260
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,400
man. It's nice to see. We've got a fucking team and a family who give a shit.

261
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,720
All right. So, the satellite window is closing. Oh, you know, I'll do this real quick for those

262
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,600
you listening to series.

263
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,360
All right. Keep those phone calls coming. Those of you on series stars 102, talk to you tomorrow.

264
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,120
Those of you still hanging out with me. You're going to love this. So it was only two days ago when I

265
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,000
did my roast recent show. I don't think I haven't looked at stats actually, but and those are fixed

266
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,320
too, by the way, the stats. So I'm reliably informed. I haven't checked them myself. And I mentioned

267
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,800
that we had a new sponsor, Splenda, which is, it's a sugar substitute, but it comes in flavors.

268
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,160
And it's in the yellow packets if you've ever seen them in the sugar at the beverage center,

269
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,560
at your office, or wherever. And so we've had that at the office now for a while and

270
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,440
and I have been kind of mixing and matching it. Obviously, I knew that they were going to be a

271
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,120
sponsor and it's cool that we closed the deal. But what really blows me away is the amount of people

272
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:48,000
who responded to that. Oh, no, second. I'll just, I got like a couple emails here. Let me just see.

273
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm using that Google notebook. Have you used that? We just copy stuff from the web and then

274
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,320
and then you can put it right into a notebook on the browser. It's pretty interesting. All right.

275
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,920
So here's a sparkle. Hi Adam. You have discovered the ultimate and coffee flavors. The thing

276
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,040
you really have to do is mixing. Make a big cup of coffee. Let's say a double sense sale at French

277
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,160
vanilla and hazelnut. Too bad it's not available in the UK over here. You can only get their normal

278
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,960
stuff. Oh, I wonder what they're going to be rolling out to the flavors, the flavors to the UK.

279
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,360
Can you bring some over when you come back from the USA? I'd love to have some in sunny Bristol.

280
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,080
Yeah, I think that's a really good idea. I should take powdery substances with me on the airplane.

281
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,480
Yeah, they really love me. Andres from Germany says, can't get any here.

282
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,280
Love to have some. That's cool. And it went even further. I actually got,

283
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,640
uh, hold on a second. I actually got a really beautiful audio comment about it. Yeah. What's

284
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,480
this? Hey Adam. This is Ron from zips71101.pocho.com. I just found out about a week ago that I'm,

285
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:05,760
I'm diabetic. And of course, that means no sugar, no candy, nothing like that. Zilch, zero,

286
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,120
gone. You can forget about it. It's not going to happen. I was really bummed out because I really do like

287
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,800
Coca-Cola. And so, um, a friend told me about, uh, diet Coke with Splenda. You know,

288
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,520
I kind of turned my nose up and I said, I don't drink diet drinks. And I'm not going to start

289
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,120
doing that. I'll just do without drink water. She said, no, you really should try it. So I said,

290
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:36,240
okay, so my wife went off to the store, picked up a pack of diet Coke with Splenda. And I'm hooked.

291
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,920
Man, it tastes great. It is really good. And there's no bad after taste. It's wonderful.

292
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:49,200
I've also tried Splenda in coffee and tea. And who knows, maybe in the morning, I'll try with

293
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,320
some kind of cereal. You know, it might, it might be a great thing for me to have for breakfast,

294
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,880
because as a diabetic, you have to have breakfast. Well, um, also, my wife picked up some sugar-free

295
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:09,200
candy made by a wrestle stover. And it was, uh, let's see, these are, um, caramel, mandallians.

296
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,440
Man, they taste like the real deal. They have Splenda in them. And they won the best taste award

297
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:24,240
and it shifts best, dot org for 2006. It's just unbelievable to taste that this candy has.

298
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,640
And it's all because of Splenda. My wife just told me that she made some homemade soup.

299
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,640
Vegetable soup. And of course, it has tomatoes. And it has a little bitter taste. So to get the

300
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,760
bitterness out, she usually has just a little touch of sugar. Well, she told me that she used Splenda.

301
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,760
I said, well, let me try it. So she had just got it off the stove and, uh, it was still hot.

302
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,160
And so I went and got me a spoon and took a little dip. Delicious. Unbelievable.

303
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:06,160
I can't detect any change in the way she cooked it. It still had that same great taste.

304
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,480
And now I found out that we have flavor blends with all the different flavors of coffee.

305
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,280
And I'm not a big coffee drinker, but you know what? I don't mind the blends.

306
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,760
So if you want to bait a tester coffee, flavor blend drinker, sign me up, because I'm going to try these things.

307
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,840
By the way, Adam, don't worry about messing up the domain name. I've even done that myself. Who hasn't?

308
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Uh-huh. So, uh, don't feel bad at all. By the way, folder. I'm not going to tell you if I have

309
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,160
folder on scruncher. You'll just have to tune in to the next podcast. Find out.

310
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,240
That's a zip seven one one zero one dot pot show dot com. Sheo, dude. Thank you so much.

311
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,440
And that you can't write that shit. And now I'm actually intrigued. You know, I'm thinking, I've never been

312
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,960
anyone to take a sugar substitute because I'm, you know, I'm like, that's it. If you're fat.

313
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,680
And, uh, maybe I should get a little better education on what sugar can do. I do, I do take sugar

314
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,960
and my coffee and my tea, yeah, sugar in the morning and sugar in the evening, sugar in the summer

315
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,320
time. Maybe I should be, uh, maybe I should be doing maybe I should have this blend on my

316
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,040
wheaties. I don't know. Definitely love to hear from you about that. And once again,

317
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:30,000
welcome to blend as a sponsor of the pod show, uh, network. All right, I got one more song before I go,

318
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,800
uh, actually it was a recommendation from a listener. Hey Adam, uh, Kevin from first person show

319
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,200
with another song for you and the Charlie listeners. This is a song that I found out about from Shelley

320
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,880
from Shelley's podcast today. It's a group called The Famous and The Song is Midway.

321
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,640
Some describe it as a bit of a country punk song. I don't really hear that. I don't hear that

322
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,760
country, but it's a great song. Rocks and it's got really hilarious lyrics if you listen to the

323
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,160
words. So I'll be like it and take care. Bye then. Scruncher folder. Oh yeah, folder. Mm-hmm. Okay.

324
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,320
Yeah, actually, I've played the song before on this very podcast, The Daily Source Code and I do

325
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:20,000
love the lyrics because I too before I die will have wanted to have seen the world's smallest horse.

326
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:50,640
On the other side of the plywood counter, with all the advantages. It's okay.

327
00:31:52,800 --> 00:32:03,600
It's now magic. It's just a few left of the food there. The developer here is just a ring toss away.

328
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:27,440
Fill off the ride on the midway. Fill off the ride on the midway.

329
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:39,680
One more time of the last time. Get to see the world's smallest horse. What a pity thing for a

330
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:54,320
rattlesnake or a seasy-top kitchen. And if you take me home before 10 o'clock, I will wash my face on

331
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,960
every day. My homework can't even call this a fair part. But it's not so fair to me.

332
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:11,520
I was in lost. I met you at the boots just like you said to do. Big Texas like what?

333
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,960
Seven stories tall. What did you expect?

334
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:32,480
Fill off the ride on the midway. Fill off the ride on the midway.

335
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:47,440
Who I nearly died on the midway. Fill off the ride on the midway.

336
00:33:47,760 --> 00:34:09,200
I actually had one of those. The seasy-top kitchen.

337
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:16,320
Given to me, buy the guys in the seasy-top. When I interviewed them in 1983, I think.

338
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,080
So all I need now is to see the fucking little pony thing and then I can kick the bucket, right?

339
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,800
