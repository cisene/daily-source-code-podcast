Our Delta Sierra Charlie 4663, it'd be national talk like a pirate day.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,440
The Pimmer 19th, 2006, so have asked you lad and lovers, hoist the main sale.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,640
This is the Daily Source Code.

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,720
The $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,360
content in my ears.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,320
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
On casting, he's Adam Curry.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,320
He has the $14.60 for it.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,320
You can take your speed all the time.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:12,320
I am resigned to hang around on your front porch and outside your dark.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,320
I rack my brain to let you know.

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,320
You're my only smile today, don't you ever go away?

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,320
You're my only smile today, don't you ever go away?

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,320
When you're not home, I lose my brain.

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I sing this song.

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,320
This song that takes me to your front porch and outside your dark.

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,320
I rack my brain, I tend to go.

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,320
You're my only smile today, don't you ever go away?

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,320
You're my only smile today, don't you ever go away?

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Isn't that just a happy song?

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
You're my only smile today, the jelly breaks from the pot set of music.

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Now work, hey everyone!

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Are you doing?

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
It's the Daily Source Code episode.

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,320
We're at the $463 now coming to you.

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,320
From Curry Cottage, in the afternoon, suburb of Suri known as Gilford.

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
It's another beautiful day.

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
We're looking at 20 degrees Celsius.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,320
So it is kind of an Indian summer.

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Apologies for yesterday.

34
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,320
We had a flash visit to Amsterdam Sunday.

35
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
So we went off Sunday.

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Actually, we had a very important engagement on Sunday.

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,320
The entire family at the hairdresser in Rotterdam.

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
This is the guy that we've been using for years.

39
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,320
He's an artist, Peter the hairdresser.

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
He is so incredibly good.

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
I mean, for me it's easy, but for Patricia and Christina.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,320
You know, a lot of stuff's got to get done for their hair.

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,320
So we took the Delta Sierra.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,320
And Captain Dan went with us, of course, and flew over.

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
There was a pretty misty actually.

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,320
We landed at Rotterdam.

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
And we were full man.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
We had full fuel.

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
We had baggage in the back.

50
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I love this aircraft.

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
It is so the right plane for me.

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
I mean, still a nice 175 knots.

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Flying along, getting from A to B.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
And like an hour and 20 minutes.

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
I love that.

56
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
And just, you know, anyway.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
So it had a great time.

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
And we had a nice dinner.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,320
And then we went to Amsterdam State at the wonderful Amsterdam Hotel.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Christina had her own sweet.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,320
There was no other room available.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
So I went for what I could get.

63
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,320
And she was totally Paris Hilton.

64
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
And Patricia and I had her own room.

65
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
It was nice.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,320
And we had to get it pretty early to go to the British embassy the next morning.

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,320
First we had to get pass photos, passport pictures taken.

68
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
And then off to the embassy.

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,320
And that was actually very nice and easy.

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Patricia couldn't come into the embassy because the point was only for Christina and myself to get our E.A. visas, which is kind of the equivalent of getting a green card because you've married in American in the States.

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
So now the roles are reversed.

72
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
And we're official and legal and happy about it.

73
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
So now stuff to do.

74
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
That's a stuff to do.

75
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
We still got a, you know, close on the house.

76
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,320
And I got to get back to San Francisco.

77
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,320
And there's important questions in life to be answered.

78
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Crap.

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Before only it worked.

80
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Hold on a second.

81
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
That's such a great lead up to that.

82
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
What the hell is going on?

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Hold on.

84
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
I hate it when this happens.

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Why am I not to, don't tell me that this is, this is really weird.

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Okay.

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I have my voice mail comments.

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,320
I cue them up in quick time.

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Because whenever I, I transpose the, the A-I-F-F from this, this protocol that my,

90
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Oh, this sucks man.

91
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Oh, I love, this is what I love about cast blasters.

92
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
It actually keeps working.

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Everything else is broken.

94
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Let me see if I can, well, that's really weird.

95
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Maybe it will work now.

96
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Hold on. Let's say let's check this.

97
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
No.

98
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
No.

99
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
It's definitely crashing and hanging.

100
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Oh, crap.

101
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Let me restart to, let me restart quick time here for a second.

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Okay.

103
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
All right.

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Now back to the important questions in life.

105
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Hey Adam.

106
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
This is Andy and Frank from Germany.

107
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
We have a question.

108
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,320
You may support us to solve.

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,320
We just wonder about if, if you've got a switch.

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
And you want to get some cool beer.

111
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Is it better to put it in the upper layers of the switch or better on a lower side of the

112
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
switch?

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,320
We're wondering what it is.

114
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,320
And maybe you can help us.

115
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Yeah.

116
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Where is it colder on a lower side or the upper side?

117
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,320
To talk about the profiles.

118
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,320
We're both quite young around the 20s.

119
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,320
And having some 45 o'clock in the morning, six o'clock already.

120
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,320
And we're listening to your show.

121
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
See you, uh, a folder.

122
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Bye.

123
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
You know, I really don't know where it's colder.

124
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Yeah.

125
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,920
Of course you don't want to make the mistake of putting it into the spot that's too cold

126
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,120
and then it starts to freeze over.

127
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,320
But I think it depends upon the equipment they use in my friends.

128
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
It really does.

129
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Now what?

130
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Now this thing won't work all of a sudden.

131
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Hey, what it is.

132
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,320
The sun will settle into the heights of the show.

133
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
The show will be gone.

134
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
So we can do some dumb and high fever.

135
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
First episode is not for next week.

136
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
So as the attendal tell your friends.

137
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Yeah, I mean.

138
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
See you next week.

139
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
See you next week.

140
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Hey.

141
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
All right.

142
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
That's the high fee show.

143
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,320
You'll see, uh, you can actually, you can, I think we have a video promo rolling

144
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
on the home page at podshow.com.

145
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Kevin F's.

146
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Phil make award-winning filmmaker from San Francisco.

147
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Now creating a, uh, by weekly show called the high fee show.

148
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,320
All about the high fee movement in San Francisco.

149
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Oakland.

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
And far beyond.

151
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
High fee dot podshow.com.

152
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,320
It's the X versus the Brits.

153
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,320
We'll drive each other crazy.

154
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,320
But everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

155
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
They're just like you and me.

156
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
It's the X and the Brits.

157
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
At that end.

158
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,320
The X versus the Brits.

159
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Mind the gap.

160
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
You know, I got a lot of problems going on, right?

161
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Totally.

162
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Yeah, Adam.

163
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
It's Ray Anthony from the radio guide.com podcast.

164
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
How you do it, everybody?

165
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Um, this might be something for your Yanks versus the Brits segment.

166
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Not really sure that I understand that mind.

167
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
The gap thing.

168
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
By the way, I was hoping you could help me out.

169
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I really, really need to make a men's here.

170
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
A few months back, I was doing a vanity search online.

171
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,320
And I came across something pretty interesting.

172
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,320
A podcast, not mine called the radio guide podcast.

173
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
The UK radio guide podcast.

174
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Now, I live in New York City.

175
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
He's in London.

176
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm a former sometimes radio guide currently working in information technology

177
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,320
as is he, both of our wives contribute to our shows.

178
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
My shows at radioguide.com.

179
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,320
His is at radioguide.co.uk.

180
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,320
So I had actually found my internet double ganger.

181
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,320
My evil podcast twin, as it were, or maybe I'm his evil twin.

182
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Actually, we're probably both evil.

183
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
But I listened to his show and I loved it contacted him.

184
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
John Newton.

185
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
He's a great guy.

186
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
We decided to swap promos.

187
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,320
And he played mine promptly on his next podcast.

188
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,320
And me being a lazy bastard and pretty busy and having released episodes

189
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
pretty infrequently.

190
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I forgot to play his promo on my next show, which was a few months later.

191
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
So here's where you come in.

192
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Would you please, pod, father?

193
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Please help me make this wrong, right, and play his promo for me on your show.

194
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
It would do him worlds of good because you have such an awesome audience and he has such a great podcast.

195
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Thanks, Adam.

196
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Here it is.

197
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Short and sweet.

198
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Recorded in the UK.

199
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Listen to all over the world.

200
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Downloaded onto multiple hard drives.

201
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320

www.radioguide.co.uk

203
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,320
The podcast from the radio guide.

204
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
I love it.

205
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Hands across the border.

206
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,320
The yanks and the brits coming together in loving harmony.

207
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Love it.

208
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Excellent.

209
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Thank you.

210
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
St. Clair sent me a note.

211
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Willie Nelson's been busted again for pot.

212
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
This is really a very funny story.

213
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Let me know.

214
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Of course I'll put the link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

215
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
It's like one of these.

216
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Uh-huh.

217
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Willie Nelson for their members.

218
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,320
For others were issued misdemeanor citations for possession of narcotic mushrooms.

219
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,320
And marijuana after traffic stop Monday morning on a Louisiana highway.

220
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Uh-huh.

221
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
This is the best.

222
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
When the door was opened and the trooper began to speak to the driver.

223
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
He smelled the strong odor of marijuana.

224
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
The renews release said.

225
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Duh.

226
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
It's a tour bus.

227
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
A search of the bus produced.

228
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
One and a half pounds of marijuana and zero point two pounds of narcotic mushrooms

229
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
according to state police.

230
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
They were all released after being issued a citation.

231
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Uh-huh.

232
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Uh-huh.

233
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Gee.

234
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,320
You think that would happen if you stopped Willie Nelson's bus?

235
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Let's see.

236
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Jeff Reed says congratulations on inking the British telecom deal.

237
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Great news.

238
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
I want to let you know.

239
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I'm experiencing issues with my phone service.

240
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,320
For some reason, I can't accept incoming calls.

241
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
It gives me.

242
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,320
It gives me a kind of information that the region.

243
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Dude.

244
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
We have a very proud of our partnership with British telecom.

245
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,320
But I do draw the line somewhere, okay?

246
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,320
And Joe from a podshow.

247
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Uh-huh.

248
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,320
And that's not a podcaster, Joe, but podshow.

249
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Uh-huh.

250
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Jersey, Joe.

251
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
We call him.

252
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Uh, who works on the servers and lives in Jersey.

253
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Because he's right in the middle of all the time zones.

254
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Uh, sent me this interesting link.

255
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,320
And this is very appropriate because I will be flying.

256
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Either Monday or Sunday.

257
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
This coming Sunday or a week later.

258
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
I'm going to go to San Francisco.

259
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
It is time.

260
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,320
And now that I can re-enter the UK legally without coming up with some story,

261
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
uh, it seems appropriate.

262
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I miss a slew of incidents involving exploding Sony batteries.

263
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Virgin Atlantic.

264
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
That's my airline.

265
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Announce that it will not allow passengers to carry any Apple or Dell laptops onto the flights.

266
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
They announced yesterday the passengers any Dell Apple laptops not be allowed to use a battery wall on flight.

267
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
The announcement posted on Virgin's website.

268
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Uh, said that passengers may carry on the laptop itself.

269
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,320
But batteries must be, quote, properly wrapped and stowed away and carry on for the duration of the flight.

270
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Uh, but the airline will provide, uh, power.

271
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
So you can still use your laptop without without the battery.

272
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Oh, man.

273
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
What's the world coming to?

274
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
And says nothing to do with terrorists.

275
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
It just has to do with exploding batteries.

276
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,320
And of course, it's not all Apple laptops that, uh, that have potentially exploding batteries.

277
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
It's not all Dell laptops.

278
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,320
In fact, it's interesting because I have a Sony bio.

279
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,320
And apparently, you know, and of course, the Sony bio has, uh,

280
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Guess what?

281
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Sony batteries.

282
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,320
So I'm allowed to take that on though.

283
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Very interesting.

284
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm going to call the, uh, you know,

285
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
We'll do that.

286
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
When I, when I make my reservation this time around, I'll record the conversation.

287
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,320
And I'll ask the, uh, I'll ask the reservation, uh, assistance.

288
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
You know, because I have the gold card stuff.

289
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
My special number.

290
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
I'll get into a conversation with him.

291
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
See if anything fun comes out of it.

292
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
I had him.

293
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
It's, um, who, long time.

294
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Charlie, listen up.

295
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm fritting and losing air forward.

296
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
At the moment, reading wide magazine.

297
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
And you made.

298
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Why has made.

299
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Page 55 of wide magazine.

300
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Um, it's got you under the, uh, the September calendar for your birthday.

301
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
So you might want to check that out.

302
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Um, not going to show.

303
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Keep it up.

304
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Hold up.

305
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Excellent.

306
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I made it in wide magazine.

307
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
All I had to do was exist.

308
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Thank you.

309
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Hey, I'm Mike Wilson.

310
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
We've been podcast here.

311
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Um, let you know by now I'm sure that I tune seven as out.

312
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,320
And, uh, there's a firmware update 1.2 for the, at least for the five, the five G.

313
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Uh, video iPods.

314
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,320
However, there's been tons and tons and tons of problems, which I hope you are aware of as well.

315
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Yeah, you know, actually I have been receiving a lot of emails about problems with

316
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
students seven about the updateer.

317
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
And I've read a lot of reports of it actually,

318
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Trashing all of your existing purchases from the iTunes music store.

319
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
And if you have podcasts that you've been saving in your iTunes directory,

320
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,320
it sometimes or maybe always deletes the episodes that are out of certain dates.

321
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
I mean, it definitely feels like we've got.

322
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,320
We have to wait for like a installer or upgraded 1.3.

323
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,320
And you may want to stay away from 1.2 as you'll go on to explain.

324
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,320
In my particular case, it makes my computer dog slow whenever it is downloading podcasts or

325
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
whenever I am thinking of my iPod.

326
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Yeah, that's right.

327
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
It's another new thing is that it takes up a lot of sits.

328
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,320
It's what we call in the software business, a memory hog.

329
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,320
The thing of iPod slow is I want care about as much.

330
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:44,320
If it's been it takes 45 minutes to an hour to sync up and add two podcasts to my iPod.

331
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:53,320
It's annoying to hell out of me and I'm about ready to do something that would be very expensive.

332
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,320
But anyway, I thought I heard at one point you had contact with an Apple.

333
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
He found out what the hell is going on.

334
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:09,320
And when they're going to get this freaking thing fixed before there's going to be some severe damage to their reputation.

335
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,320
There are tons and tons of people that have found out in the Apple's forum that are absolutely ticked off.

336
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Now obviously, though the people who are having problems that was at a vocal,

337
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:28,320
but in some of these sort of 100 or 100 comments I'm already in none of them are,

338
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
oh yeah, mine works fine.

339
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I didn't have any problems.

340
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
So give a big show.

341
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Thank you.

342
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Yeah, that's how Apple is.

343
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,320
They don't typically respond to stuff like that unless they have a fix ready to go.

344
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,320
And usually they get stuff fixed pretty quickly,

345
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
but this is really wise which to win those is because whenever there's something new,

346
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
I'd like to have it.

347
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I like to get it.

348
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I get totally caught up in the whole Apple vibe.

349
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
I love the way the products feel the way they operate,

350
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,320
but the hardware has been failing.

351
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
And now it seems like with the iPod.

352
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I still have, I guess, a fourth gen iPod, which I really,

353
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,320
I have to admit is being replaced now by the Nokia N91.

354
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
I'm going to get the,

355
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
there, what is it, the Blackberry Killer,

356
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,320
but they talk about is that the N92, I believe.

357
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm going to try that one out because it's,

358
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
well, we'll just see.

359
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I mean, there's a lot about the Blackberry I really love.

360
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
You know, the thumb wheel is a big part of it,

361
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
but I think for podcasting,

362
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
particularly with the Wi-Fi built in,

363
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,320
really liking that capability.

364
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
So I haven't been using my iPod as much,

365
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
but Apple will fix it.

366
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
They always do.

367
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
And when something's really fucked up,

368
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
they eventually come round.

369
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
You know, they've given rebates on batteries and stuff.

370
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,320
And, you know, I kind of understand where they're coming from.

371
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
And, you know,

372
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
what the folks at Apple listen,

373
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
they listen to this show.

374
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
And I'm sure they're aware of it.

375
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
And they'll get on it.

376
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
I can't defend them for it.

377
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I'm just, I'm actually no longer a user of the product.

378
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I have to say.

379
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,320
If you got something to say in your wondering,

380
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
how you can get a hold of this program,

381
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
this podcast,

382
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
well, there's some numbers you can dial.

383
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Dr. H. Adam in America.

384
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
dial.

385
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
plus 1,

386
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
2, 0, 1,

387
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5,

388
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:16,720
7,

389
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,320
plus 1, 2, 0, 1,

390
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
6, 2, 5, 6,

391
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
5, 6, 3, 5, 7,

392
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
again.

393
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,320
For Adam in Great Britain,

394
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
dial.

395
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
4, 2, 0, 7,

396
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
6, 8, 1, 3,

397
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
7, 5, 3,

398
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,320
plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7,

399
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,320
6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3,

400
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Thanks for going on the daily source code.

401
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Goodbye.

402
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
You know what I love?

403
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Hold it as concha.

404
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
You know what I love so much about that?

405
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
It's just nothing about the tune

406
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,320
that is catchy enough to help me remember the actual number.

407
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I still do not know these numbers by heart.

408
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,320
You can always find them on in the show notes at daily source code.com.

409
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Plus 1, 2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6,

410
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
6, 3, 5, 7,

411
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
or plus 4, 4,

412
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
and London,

413
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3,

414
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
7, 5, 3.

415
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Still awaiting the Earthlink ad challenge winner.

416
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,320
I know we have finalists who are winners,

417
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,320
but it's something's got to go in rotation pretty soon.

418
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
So be on the lookout for that.

419
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
And there's more voice mail.

420
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Hi Adam. I've been holding out to give you a call

421
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
about a number of subjects.

422
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,320
First of all, Peter.

423
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
That mess he left away.

424
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
He goes his friend.

425
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Oh man, I want all the pee stands for a Peter.

426
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
You know what I'm saying?

427
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
But I love the I am.

428
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
I will forever be a fan of his.

429
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
I thought that was one of the he best.

430
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
You know, that was the best audio comment.

431
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Anyone has ever left?

432
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Okay.

433
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
So secondly, scrunch it.

434
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Why the hell would anyone scrunch?

435
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Seriously.

436
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
You get shit all over your hand.

437
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
I tried it the other day just to experiment.

438
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
It's horrible.

439
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
The other thing is maybe I'm just cack handed full.

440
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,320
The other thing is, it's BT, wireless broadband,

441
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
TV stuff.

442
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Okay, you're chatting away about that.

443
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Whatever, you know, if things will happen,

444
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
that's going to be all good.

445
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
You get in that first.

446
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Make sure it's done properly.

447
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
That's nice.

448
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,320
But I have to say, you were talking about free view

449
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
and you say it's super quality.

450
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
You know what?

451
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Digital TV in my opinion.

452
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
This is a bit of a tin for hot moment.

453
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
It's rubbish.

454
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
What did you say there?

455
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Hold on a second.

456
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Hold on.

457
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
I'm sorry.

458
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
What did you say there?

459
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
It's a bit of a tin for hot moment indeed.

460
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
tin for hot moment.

461
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
It's rubbish.

462
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Seriously rubbish.

463
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
The amount of bands that they have.

464
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,320
You would think they'd be able to wrap the quality.

465
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
But you can see the compression.

466
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
There's all this banding and blockiness.

467
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
You watch any dissolve or mix.

468
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,320
You know, anything that involves high amounts of solid colour.

469
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
You can feel the blockiness or crowd shots.

470
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Okay.

471
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
I'm a television professional.

472
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Media wankers and other words saying it.

473
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
But media one.

474
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Oh, God, it winds me up.

475
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,320
There's the audio quality and the picture quality of an analog signal.

476
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
It's fast to period.

477
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
It's fast to period.

478
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Once it's been snapped up to space and back down again.

479
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Oh, all right.

480
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Ran over.

481
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Peace.

482
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Bravo.

483
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
You know, of course.

484
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
When you guys are streaming stuff and why have you.

485
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Hopefully you'll have enough bandwidth to make it all look nice.

486
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Like really nice.

487
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Maybe even HD TV nice, which I have to say.

488
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
I've always wanted to.

489
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,320
I've always shoot a shoot thing on film whenever I can.

490
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,320
I have to say when HD HD is a list properly.

491
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
My jar.

492
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
It looks amazing.

493
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
It really does.

494
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
I'm so surprised.

495
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,320
I haven't even bought myself a digital still camera because I'm a bit old like that.

496
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Anyway, um,

497
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
God, what a boring message.

498
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
My name's Charles.

499
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Uh, and actually I live in London.

500
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Bye.

501
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Alright, Charles.

502
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,320
I really do appreciate it.

503
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Oh, man.

504
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Tim for a little bit.

505
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
At the free you stop as great, man.

506
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,320
I think it just depends on, you know, you still have to have good reception.

507
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
If you don't have good reception because it comes in through the air.

508
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,320
You know, you'll have to re-jigger your antenna.

509
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
But once you've got good reception, it works.

510
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
I don't know.

511
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
I'm not seeing the same things you have.

512
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
And I'm getting it right off the antenna on the roof.

513
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
So it works fine over here, my brother.

514
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
She's pretty. She's got a beautiful voice.

515
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
She's a nice person.

516
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,320
And a great addition to the quality of music we have to work.

517
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,320
And she just 50% of our current students by switching to guy go.

518
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Well, the last one isn't true.

519
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
With all the other ones around.

520
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Fitoia Khan.

521
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,320
In episode 97 of The Pot Show, you will hear the Fitoia behind the music.

522
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Fifties center and white planes.

523
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
And I performed near or there.

524
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Back in August and big crowd.

525
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
I was very nervous.

526
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,320
But I ended up getting a standing ovation.

527
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,320
I look into my mirror.

528
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
I came here to know my mind.

529
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,320
Everything you always wanted to know about Fitoia Khan.

530
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,320
In episode 97 of Mike's Pot Show, check it out at www.markbars.com.

531
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,320
That's m-a-r-k-b-a-r-s.com.

532
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
What?

533
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
When you eat a hot dog.

534
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
What do you think?

535
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
A hot dog?

536
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
A hot dog?

537
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
A hot dog?

538
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
A hot dog?

539
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
A hot dog.

540
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Hey Adam, what's up?

541
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
It's Jersey Todd.

542
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Remember during the summer you played this song from the Children of Selstead primary school?

543
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Yeah, this was the school that was in danger of closing.

544
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,320
And the kids came up with the song as part of the effort to save the school and posted

545
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
the track up to the PMM.

546
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Well, I'm absolutely thrilled to say that I just got an email from the school governor

547
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,320
who wants to let everyone know that it's been determined that the school

548
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
not be closed.

549
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,320
I just wanted to thank you for helping draw attention to the issue.

550
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,320
I want to thank all the listeners who went out and purchased the copy of the song,

551
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,320
and all the other podcasts who played the song.

552
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Once again, we have yet another example of what we can do as a podcast community

553
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,320
to really help out when we pull all of our resources.

554
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,320
And frankly, I am really looking forward to being able to do something like this again.

555
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Yo, thanks, bro.

556
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,320
And hey, everyone, this song is still available for sale on their website.

557
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,320
And I'll send Adam a link and hopefully I'll put it up in the show notes.

558
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
But this is a great thing.

559
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Talk to you later.

560
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Yes.

561
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Very cool.

562
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Hey, I'm cool.

563
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
A lot of people sent me email about that.

564
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
It's excellent.

565
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,320
And I will put a link to the song and

566
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
and to the site, as Jersey Todd mentioned,

567
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
the cell-stead school.

568
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,320
And I don't know if it came through purchases of the song,

569
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
if we were able to contribute or not.

570
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,320
But I did get a message from the governor as well.

571
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,320
And this was the first audio comments.

572
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
That's really why I've only been sharing it.

573
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
Please send more audio comments.

574
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
You guys send great stuff in email.

575
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
It's called the voice mail line number or something.

576
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,320
It's much more powerful when I can play a piece of audio

577
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
relating to a topic like this.

578
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Excellent.

579
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Excellent.

580
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
I guess we just keep buying the song.

581
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Keep the money coming to this school.

582
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
Man, it can never be enough money in school.

583
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Hi, this is Lockjaw.

584
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Host of the podcast, junkie show.

585
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Now, usually I'd be using this time to promote my own podcast.

586
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
But recently, I've discovered a show that

587
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,320
well, quite frankly, has me absolutely blown away.

588
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
It's called, I love the company.

589
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Put out by David at Blito.

590
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Better known as that guitar man from Central Park.

591
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,320
You know, the guy playing guitar right here.

592
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Every day, Monday through Friday, he plays some great music.

593
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Has some great artists, including himself.

594
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,320
And Wednesday has a special show called The Wednesday Morning Wakeup Call.

595
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Now, the latest episode had me absolutely moved to tears.

596
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Find out why go to that guitar man.com.

597
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Download episode 109.

598
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Well, heck, download them all.

599
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
They're really good.

600
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
And I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

601
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,320
It's one podcast I can strongly recommend.

602
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,320
That guitar man scares me because he's so damn good.

603
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,320
You know, he's got more talent than any person

604
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,320
person should.

605
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,320
He can sing a song romantic and sweet.

606
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,320
And then you'll laugh so hard.

607
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,320
You'll fall off your seat.

608
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
He's on the PM and that's neat.

609
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Because he's not so scary.

610
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Yeah, I love that show too.

611
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
I love the company David at Blito.

612
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
He's got to go in on man.

613
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
He's just five shows a week.

614
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
And the short, you know,

615
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
they're like 20 minutes, 20 to 30 minutes.

616
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,320
And it's always filled with good fun songs.

617
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
You know, and topical songs.

618
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,320
I'm telling you, he's the Bob Dylan of our generation.

619
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
He don't want to believe it.

620
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
But he is.

621
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,320
It's given us words that have the little more meaning than.

622
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Well, fill in your favorite Jay Z track here.

623
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,320
You know, the last Charlie we did together was on Friday with Patricia.

624
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,320
And we talked about death and about my mom passing and how we felt about it.

625
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
And now the work couple months down the road.

626
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,320
And obviously a lot of feedback for that episode.

627
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
And I really appreciate it.

628
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
I'm saving the majority of it for the next show.

629
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
I do with Patricia, which may be tomorrow.

630
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,320
But I did get a lot of comments that I wanted to share in this episode.

631
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Because it's just such a deluge.

632
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,320
And people are really, really clueling into this topic.

633
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Hi, Adam.

634
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,320
This is Jason Gerrit from the Buddhist podcast.

635
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Just wanted to ask a question.

636
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
And maybe pass on a request.

637
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,320
First, thank you so much for the peer men.

638
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
We love it.

639
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,320
And we use it a lot for both of our podcasts.

640
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,320
It's opened our eyes up to so much talent.

641
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,320
And we've been able to share music with our listeners.

642
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Each time we play a track,

643
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,320
we say it's from the podcast music network at music.potshow.com.

644
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,320
The thing is, we get a lot of email from people who want to buy the tracks,

645
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,320
but the buy buttons have not yet been enabled.

646
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,320
I know you guys have been real mega busy,

647
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,320
but can you give us some insight into when these buy buttons will be enabled?

648
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Or what the time table is, so we can tell our listeners.

649
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Okay, the second thing is,

650
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Buddhism teaches that women support others,

651
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,320
and thereby cause others to support them.

652
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,320
So I think after the last show,

653
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,320
when you lost it with Patricia,

654
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,320
I will before the woman who takes such great care of you.

655
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Love the pop show, love pod show, love your honesty, happy days.

656
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Oh man, thank you.

657
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,320
I didn't lose it with Patricia.

658
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
We always talk like that.

659
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,320
And that's the beauty of the reality of the show.

660
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,320
And I bow before her, you know that.

661
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Regarding PMN sales,

662
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,320
we're going to be launching a pod safe music channel

663
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
on Podshow Plus, which is going to be,

664
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
I think you're going to like it.

665
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Really will be, you know,

666
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,320
we say we have the Podset Music Network for artists

667
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,320
and for podcasters, which was its original and its soul intent.

668
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
When I couldn't change anything with that at all,

669
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,320
we are bringing in elements to integrate the audience.

670
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,320
And of course, in part of that is the buying part.

671
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
So I believe we're doing everything in one go.

672
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,320
It's, you know, we have a number of tracks already enabled

673
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
and selling and that's working quite well.

674
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,320
And I think we're ready to scale it up and to enable the buy button.

675
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Now that, of course, depends on the artists themselves.

676
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,320
They don't have to make it available for sale.

677
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,320
So once that goes, then if you want your, you know,

678
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,320
every artist will have the opportunity to select each individual track

679
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
if they want to make it for sale or not.

680
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
It's just the beauty of what we're doing with the music industry,

681
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
completely changing it around.

682
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Wow, let's get back to death now.

683
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Hello, Adam.

684
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,320
I'm a listener from Pat Singh London and a similar age to yourself.

685
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,320
I used to live in Walkerston and another affluent suburb of Gilford.

686
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,320
I've been listening to a discussion about your mum and also to your advice

687
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,320
to a gigapodcast when you ask them to move out of their comfort zone

688
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,320
and be far more honest you and their shows.

689
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Now, at Christmas, I watched my dad die in hospital

690
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,320
and I remember at the time you talking about your own father's illnesses last year.

691
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Now, you know, you never ever mention your dad

692
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,320
and frankly, it's starting to get spooky.

693
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,320
When my father's death, it affected how I see, think and react to my mum,

694
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
my surviving parents.

695
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,320
You are the male architect type in your household

696
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,320
and there must be deeper water still that you've not died into during your podcast.

697
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,320
I want to say, as a friend to you, only via your podcast,

698
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
please talk to me about your dad.

699
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,320
Open up your own no-go areas and let me understand how you see that world.

700
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,320
By the way, our proud scruncher, who never, ever buys

701
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
colored toilet paper.

702
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,320
And quite frankly, why should you?

703
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Good challenge. I like that.

704
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,320
I think you've made a good point through all my words back in my face.

705
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Well, the truth of the matter is that I do not have a very good relationship

706
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,320
at all with my father.

707
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,320
And this is mainly by his choice.

708
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,320
My parents divorced when I was, I believe, 16 or 17.

709
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,320
And even at that point, I did have to kind of jump into what was going on there.

710
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,320
And I said, look, you know, one thing I want to make sure we do here is there's a clean break.

711
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
And apparently he'd been flandering for years.

712
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,320
He definitely has an alcohol problem which he admits to.

713
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,320
And he really wanted to reboot his life.

714
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,320
And it was with new wife and new job and new location.

715
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,320
And you know, there's always a lot of blame on his upbringing.

716
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Always, always, always, always.

717
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
In fact, that was used.

718
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,320
I think it's been used as an excuse for years.

719
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Though I had no rules when he was growing up.

720
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,320
And therefore he doesn't know how to play by the rules or something to that effect.

721
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,320
And he also, you know, wanted to new kids, I think.

722
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,320
And he, he remarried.

723
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,320
And here's the interesting.

724
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Well, man.

725
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Just like a whole, a whole novella here that I could, that I could bring up.

726
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
And maybe I should do it in parts.

727
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
But I do want to be honest about it.

728
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,320
But just to add a little bit of insult to injury.

729
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,320
The woman he wound up remarried, wound up marrying.

730
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,320
I had known.

731
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
I was just leaving it at that.

732
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,320
So that's, you know, and then they had a, had a kid.

733
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,320
And what was interesting is that my sisters and I and my mom, of course,

734
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,320
really my sisters and I, you know, and my sisters really tried a lot longer than I did.

735
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Not harder, but longer.

736
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,320
But I saw the writing on the wall very soon.

737
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
The man only has one goal.

738
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,320
And his goal is to become a multimillionaire.

739
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,320
And I've tried to help him out with that before.

740
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,320
And that has not been a very enjoyable experience in the, you know,

741
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,320
working together, uh, co-wrote a book with him.

742
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,320
And, you know, just a lot of loose ends that he doesn't tie up properly.

743
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,320
And it just all comes back to the fact that all he's interested in is doing business.

744
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,320
I probably, you know, insult the injury to him.

745
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,320
The fact that I have been successful and financially successful probably bugs the shit out of him.

746
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
So, um,

747
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,320
aside the fact for us not having contact for a number of years growing up, you know,

748
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,320
but he was very busy during my, my younger formative years and really wasn't around.

749
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
And it's because he was out partying as well.

750
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
You know, so it wasn't, it wasn't just work.

751
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,320
And he had a very important job and, and I do value his contribution for what that is.

752
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,320
But there was just never a contact, you know.

753
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,320
I, I can't, I, the times we tossed the ball around in the front or backyard,

754
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,320
I can count on one half of a hand.

755
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,320
So the contact just wasn't there and whenever I tried to re-establish it,

756
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,320
it always came back to business.

757
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
He can only talk about business.

758
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Then, you know, he went into hospital as he had a minor stroke and then,

759
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,320
uh, somewhat more severe stroke and he still been rehabilitation.

760
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,320
Um, and, you know, and he's still battling alcoholism.

761
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Uh, and he's a mess.

762
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,320
And, you know, and my sisters and I have tried.

763
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,320
And he, all he just talks about business and we say,

764
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
we just talk about normal things for a second.

765
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
You know, just forget about it.

766
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Let's talk about life and health and he can't do it.

767
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,320
And honestly, after, you know, many, many, many years of trying,

768
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,320
I kind of like said, I don't care anymore.

769
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
I give up, you know.

770
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
It's not my job.

771
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
He, he left us and wanted to try re-booting.

772
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,320
It didn't work out the way he expected it to.

773
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
You know, can't be bothered.

774
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,320
It's kind of the way it feels.

775
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,320
It's exactly the way it feels.

776
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Uh, and I may regret that.

777
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,320
I totally realize it.

778
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Um, but for now, you know, and, and this is not just me.

779
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,320
I have two sisters who agree with this and are equally as frustrated

780
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,320
and have probably equally as easily given up.

781
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,320
That's just the situation in the way it is.

782
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Uh, I'll think about it some more though because, you know,

783
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,320
just surprised me that you wanted this, uh, this honest, uh, discussion about it.

784
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
So I'll, I'll, I'll, uh,

785
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Dredge up some more.

786
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
I agree.

787
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
It's good for me and hopefully not too boring for you.

788
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,320
I had a, uh, day from South Florida here going back.

789
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Um, I just came to this revelation at the, at the share.

790
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Um, I sold my high blood yesterday, uh, in preparation of buying one of the new, uh, 80 gig

791
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
work.

792
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,320
And, um, this is the first time I've been traveling, uh, to an appointment, uh,

793
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,320
see one of my clients with out of high blood and probably five years.

794
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
I've been listening to the radio.

795
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Man, this sucks dude.

796
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Um, yeah.

797
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Anyway.

798
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
That's it.

799
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Bye.

800
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Yeah.

801
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,320
I know it does, dude.

802
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
It totally blows.

803
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Those chunks.

804
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
And I've been getting Patricia into podcasting.

805
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,320
She's been finding stuff on her own and pod show plus.

806
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
She hasn't signed up for an account yet.

807
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
She's like, why?

808
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Why should I do that?

809
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Well, because then you can listen all these things and you get the show and it's there automatically

810
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,320
for you and she hasn't quite see the benefit of it.

811
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,320
But she's been listening to stuff and she'd be listening to the Frank Truth podcast and, uh,

812
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,320
I showed her how to watch a, uh, a fashion video podcast and she liked that.

813
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,320
And then there's the, uh, the jazz, the jazz suite.

814
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
And, uh, what's the other show?

815
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,320
I like so much the, uh,

816
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
hold on a second.

817
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Let me go to my, uh,

818
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
What's the name of it?

819
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,320
I'm just going to my collection here,

820
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
a pod show plus.

821
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
And I'll tell you exactly what it is.

822
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,320
It's the, um, it's another like big band type show.

823
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Uh, I found it through Lindy Hopper Cindy who works in a finance at, at pod show.

824
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Let me see, uh,

825
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
collection, here we go.

826
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Let me see if it shows up right away.

827
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Otherwise it, otherwise I'll just put it in the show notes.

828
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,320
Um, it's under music.

829
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,320
It's already scrolled off.

830
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Damn.

831
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,320
What's the name of that show?

832
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
I love it.

833
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Okay.

834
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Tell you what.

835
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
I'll play one more song.

836
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
No.

837
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
I'll do this.

838
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
Question about my setup.

839
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Hi Adam.

840
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
This is Gary Alexander in Las Vegas.

841
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,320
And I'm listening to the, at the show from, uh,

842
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
such a brace.

843
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,320
And I just got to the part where the guy was,

844
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,320
was talking about, uh, studio equipment.

845
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
And you said that, uh,

846
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
you have the high, uh,

847
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,320
I think it's the PR 40 from the second.

848
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,320
Um, that that's about a $400 microphone.

849
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
If I'm not mistaken myself.

850
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Uh, I think that that I have,

851
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,320
I have actually tried to find out what kind of equipment you have as well.

852
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,320
And, um, I heard you say you had to help the high, uh,

853
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
microphone.

854
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,320
And I think that about a $400 microphone.

855
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,320
And your stereo, uh,

856
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,320
compressor that you have, uh,

857
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
is not, you're not going to get the same.

858
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,320
And I know you know this, but I want to mislead the

859
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
listeners the way that the show has been going, uh,

860
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
on the age here.

861
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Um,

862
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,320
the stereo compressor is better than a hundred dollars,

863
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,320
um, compressor that we may be able to afford out here.

864
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Um,

865
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,320
granted you can get better sound.

866
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
All right.

867
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Hold on a second.

868
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
First of all, the mic, I checked it online.

869
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
The mic is like,

870
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
you're right.

871
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
It's not 150 boxes like 250 bucks,

872
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
but you can get one cheaper on eBay.

873
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
And there are lots of microphones similar to the

874
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,320
HIL PR40 that'll work just as well.

875
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
But okay, you're right, but it's not 400 bucks.

876
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,320
The compressor, yeah, I'm using a nice one.

877
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
And, uh, and that's what I said.

878
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
It's the TLA 5052 stereo valve processor.

879
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
You better believe it's got a great sound.

880
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
But whenever I go on the road,

881
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,320
and I use the cheap $100 limiter compressor,

882
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,320
people sometimes even say they like that sound better.

883
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
So it's just a matter of, you know,

884
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
of adjusting all the knobs.

885
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,320
You can pretty much get this type of sound out of any setup.

886
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,320
And then if you're lucky, you can keep the setup,

887
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
which is problematic for me because I keep moving

888
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
and acoustic change and, uh,

889
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
the mixer bumps around in the,

890
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
in the suitcase and then those settings change.

891
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,320
And, you know, sometimes a little tough.

892
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,320
But in general, I get, you know,

893
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
lots of compliments about my on the road sound as well.

894
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,320
So I got to say it's not the microphone.

895
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
Uh, that is affordable,

896
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
and you really can do it with a $100 compressor.

897
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,320
But that stereo compressor is going to,

898
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,320
if you use a skewer is not on our box.

899
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
And I think that the way that you described it,

900
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
even though you're telling the truth,

901
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
is a bit misleading.

902
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
And, uh, even though you have a small,

903
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
little mixing board there,

904
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
it's 150 bucks.

905
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
Yeah, okay.

906
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Well, you probably got four EQ controls on that thing,

907
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
which is nothing.

908
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,320
But your tone is coming from that stereo compressor,

909
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,320
as well as that how you're 40.

910
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,320
And, uh, I just feel like that,

911
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,320
the listeners are being a little misled

912
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
on how you get your one tone.

913
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,320
It also helps as you have an amazing voice.

914
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Uh, and God kind of gifted you on that.

915
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
So that has nothing to do with money,

916
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,320
other than the fact that it's millions.

917
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Holder.

918
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Ha ha ha.

919
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Uh, I can turn it off.

920
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Let me see.

921
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
It's now off.

922
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Yeah, the volume is going to be a lot softer,

923
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
hold on.

924
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Maybe I can go like that.

925
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
So now this, now the process,

926
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
two, two.

927
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Yeah, processers now off.

928
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Uh, it makes a difference, but not like that.

929
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Holder.

930
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Now I got to turn it back.

931
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
Holder.

932
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Crap.

933
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
There we go.

934
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
See?

935
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
I mean, I do it.

936
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,320
Then I mess up all my settings.

937
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Ha ha.

938
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Hey, it's the name of that podcast.

939
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
I was looking for is Hay Mr. Jessie.

940
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Uh, founded my channels and my collection.

941
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,320
You can also just use the find it function on the podshow.com,

942
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,320
which I'm finding increasingly more useful.

943
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
I'd really like it.

944
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
It pulls out stuff out of episodes.

945
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
You can play it right there.

946
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
You can listen to each individual one without the page,

947
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
flopping away.

948
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
It gives you the, the album art.

949
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
It's getting pretty good.

950
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,320
And this Thursday, it happens.

951
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,320
It officially drops episode number five.

952
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Oh, fuck man.

953
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Fuck.

954
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
So much pilot error today.

955
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
It's not funny.

956
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:56,320
That would be episode number five of Shadow Falls.

957
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
Shadow Falls.

958
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
That podshow.com.

959
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,320
I'd just be good.

960
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,320
I was dead wrong.

961
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
You roasted King.

962
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,320
That swings both ways.

963
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,320
They're not asked money.

964
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,320
I am here.

965
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
I am here.

966
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
I am here.

967
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,320
I am sleeping.

968
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,320
I am late.

969
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,320
I am not here.

970
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:44,320
I am there for our breathing.

971
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Oh.

972
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,320
I whisper soft.

973
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:04,320
Now we're deflating off.

974
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Look for my sign.

975
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Let me light that shine to the shadows.

976
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,320
I am here.

977
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,320
I am here.

978
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
I am here.

979
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,320
Why are you sleeping?

980
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,320
I am late.

981
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,320
I am late.

982
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,320
I am here for our breathing.

983
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:46,320
I am here.

984
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:56,320
I am here.

985
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Monk, acoustic version of I have.

986
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Modly steam from Shadow Falls.

987
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,320
We only have one more episode to go after Thursdays episode number five before the end

988

994
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,320
As an AUAR.

995
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
Alright, shit.

996
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:47,320
