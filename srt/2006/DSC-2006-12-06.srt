And now with new minty fresh scent.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're listening to Donut, Sesame, until 5-0 minor.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
With 15 pounds of pasta, sliding down the drain.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Stainers?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And a sense sales strap to his ass.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Huh?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We don't need no stinkings.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He likes to think he's cooking in the kitchen.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Puff the casting.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's Adam Curry.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're listening to Donut's Gerrit Charlie.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Daily source code.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000

Brace yourself for the show that's got it all.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Potsay from music, the Lady Patricia, and of course, your host, Adam Curry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Come to you from the Curry Condo and San Francisco, California.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Delta, Gerrit Charlie, 5-0, 9-0.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, yeah.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, the tip of Jesus dropping in again.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm all alone out walking tonight.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I used to have a spring in my step, but now something is missing.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And I know it's not right.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Last year I was good and oh, Charlie,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Satanic was too to his word.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I was the top of the list of all those things.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was the top of the list of all those who were blessed.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But this year I don't know.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I give back those toys and gadgets and it connects.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That he left under the tree.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't need the sweater and the jacket and the egg.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No, I've had it and it's no good for me.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If it's here, I've been thinking that I don't need a thing.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You get hiding a box, it's true.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There's all I want for Christmas is some hugging,

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and it's kissing from you.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I give up my eye and watch a flow of blackberry.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't need to make any calls.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, don't need my sling box.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Maybe you could call me crazy.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't watch it at all.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The magic bullet, the toast or the thing that makes the roast beat like so on TV.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
All my brand new fender tell a caston.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It don't mean nothing to me.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No, I give back those toys and gadgets and it connects.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That he left under the tree.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't need the sweater and the jacket and the egg.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, I've had it and it's no good for me.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Or this year I've been thinking that I don't need a thing.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You get hiding a box, it's true.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But all I want for Christmas is some hugging,

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and it's the kiss in front of you.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, you know what's it to?

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So come on baby, don't leave me blue and I'll be here.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's start something new.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, I give back those toys and gadgets and it connects.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That he left under the tree.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't need the sweater and the jacket and the egg.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, I've had it and it's no good for me.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This year I've been thinking that I don't need a thing.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You get hiding a box, it's true.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There's all I want for Christmas is some hugging,

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and it's the kiss in front of you.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And it's the love and some sweet.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't have a wanted on my Christmas,

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but it was you.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, it's the encounter.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just now when the Christmas is here, baby.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Some Christmas, hugging and kissing from you.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everybody how you doing coming to you from the Curry condo

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in a very sunny Northern California and San Francisco to be exact.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It is the Daily Source Code episode 5-0-9.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And just do you hear that?

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I got a little home here.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I got a hummer.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let me check, check one, two.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, got in yesterday.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And after an uneventful flight, you know,

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Virgin VS 19, C12K, if you're looking to blow me up, that's the one.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A little disappointing that normally they change the movies.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
At the beginning of the month and I hadn't changed them yet.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't understand.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And boy, the state of movies can be so bad.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think I've seen just about every single one of the 25 movies

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that Virgin has available.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And it's...

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They're also predictable.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Anyway, it was beautiful yesterday.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Got in one straight to the office.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We have a board of directors meeting this morning.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Got this afternoon, actually.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
One o'clock.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And after that, it's like the first holiday party.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We've got like three holiday parties.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, I'm here.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So Patricia actually...

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I love her to love her to bits, man.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She put together all the different outfits.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's the cleaner Perkins thing.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You wear this one to Ray Lane's birthday.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This one to the Pod Show holiday party.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We are kind of in that festive spirit, aren't we?

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And so are the Podcasters, by the way.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Lots of promos.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hey, everyone.

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is Ed Roberts from a looking up a window music podcast.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, it's that time of the year.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Time to get ready for the Christmas season.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Time to get into some great Podsafe Christmas songs.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
2005 saw some incredible Podsafe Christmas music.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And with the growth of Pod casting over the last year,

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
2006 promises to be even better.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And that's why I've started up a brand new podcast,

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
specifically for the Christmas season.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's called Podsafe Christmas.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Every day, from now until Christmas,

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll play two or three great Podsafe Christmas songs

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
that you can take with you as you get ready for the Christmas season.

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's your daily fix of Christmas music,

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
direct from the world of Podsafe music.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Visit PodsafeChristmas.com.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You can subscribe to the feed directly from there

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
or you can listen directly from the website.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Your soundtrack for the holidays.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
PodsafeChristmas.com.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's so weird, you know, traveling between two different continents.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's hard to get into the Christmas vibe, you know.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It definitely celebrated differently in the UK.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And by the way, in the UK, the weather is kind of Christmasy.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's shit.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's completely, I left it was raining once again.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And then, you know, you get on a sheet metal tube

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and you fly for 10 hours and then you're kind of out of it.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It says difficult.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Just kind of through some stuff here,

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Ubercaster, which is, let's just call it the Cast Blaster for Mac,

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
although it isn't.

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's something completely different.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But a lot of people are using this program, Ubercaster.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And the question that came in a while ago, I think,

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
was when is this going to work with Podschio with the Pod Cast delivery network?

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Just like Cast Blaster does.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If you haven't seen Cast Blaster, Cast Blaster.com,

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
you can create a podcast on it and fill in your information,

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
your details, your username and password

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
for the Podschio Pod Cast delivery network.

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And it'll shoot up your show notes and get your feed in order

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and take all that stuff and take care of all that stuff,

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
populate your homepage, etc.

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And the question was, when is that going to work with Ubercaster?

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I saw that a new release came out of Ubercaster.

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's still a beta version.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And so I'm looking for the, you know,

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
for the compatibility, because I know that we worked pretty hard

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and to grummit work with the guys at Ubercaster.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There was something really weird in Mac,

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
in the Mac OS that didn't do XML RPC properly.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I know a little bit of tinfoil hide moment.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So I know that that got resolved.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And so I'm looking through the revision history notes.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And it's out, it was actually in there in the previous release.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Only it says,

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
oh, check this out.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This function, this functionality,

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
not available in the free beta version.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I wonder why?

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So I guess only if you pay for Ubercaster,

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
do you get that capability baked in?

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Nah, it's a shame.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But anyway, that's, you know,

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it's open for anyone.

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Anyone can go to developer.podshow.com.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Still waiting for someone to make a,

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
some kind of connection from audacity,

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
which, of course, makes so much sense.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
An open source project with an open API.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Could it be any easier than that, guys?

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Even though we're in San Fran,

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
UK listen up, pay attention now.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah, got an awesome piece of feedback about the,

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I was waiting for this to happen.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And in fact, it took a little bit longer than I anticipated it to take,

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
because we have had other things lined up.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, I'll play this for you and you'll know what I'm talking about.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There Adam, it's probably beef and punky radio here.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I've just got a brief message for you.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And this has come in from one of our listeners.

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This came through our beauty podshow page,

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
which is rather nice.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It says, the podshow stinger does suck,

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but you know, sounds like some American

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
selling me a kitchen in the 50s.

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I have to agree with them.

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The podshow stinger in my opinion is absolutely rubbish.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I've had this idea for one that I think might be a bit better.

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I will talk over the bits that are already done.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You'll see what I mean.

201
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Podshow.

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Beaty Podshow.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Podshow.

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Beaty Podshow.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sing along, too.

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's creative.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Podshow.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Beaty Podshow.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Podshow.

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Wow.

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Beaty Podshow.

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
All the way from good old blighty.

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just make it better Adam.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Just it was a favor, will you?

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah.

216
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They sent in another one.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let me see if I can find that one.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That was pretty funny, too.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, I agree.

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They sucked total ass.

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm American.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not English.

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So I'm waiting for you guys to send something in.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Make some stinger as you call them.

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Make them make me some stinger,

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
so we can put those in front of our UK podcast.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes, it's me.

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Paulie beat from punky radio here.

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hi, Adam.

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I just like to say that we've had a few comments from regular listeners

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
to punky radio since we've gone on to Beaty Podshow.

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a fabulous pleasure to be here, of course.

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But I don't have to say your stinger is rubbish.

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What an earth is going on.

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why have you got to say, oh, no.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Used to be in milk, but no.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's an incredible blaty.

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is a good opportunity anymore.

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I can't believe you're not using an English accent on there.

240
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'd like you to discuss.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'd like you to change.

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I've had enough.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And as if here's proof,

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
my co-host Tony never says beat to a ghost and Tony.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What do you think of it?

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's pants.

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's pants.

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There you go.

249
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There's your stinger.

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay.

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Another beaty, beaty Podshow podcast.

252
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's pants.

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Make some.

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Will you send them to me?

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Adam at poncho.com.

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hey.

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Stop fucking sizzling at Paul.

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It took me a second or two to understand that one.

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because, of course, the original was.

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Hey.

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't know who this is, but stop fucking calling sizzling at Paul.

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And stuff is getting out of control.

263
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Here's the edit room.

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Stop fucking sizzling at Paul.

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I haven't heard from sizzling a while.

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know who this is, but stop being calling just out.

267
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You guys are out of control.

268
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
One, two, one.

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Six, two, five.

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Six, three, five.

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Seven.

272
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
One, two, one.

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Six, two, five.

274
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Six, three, five.

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Seven.

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hello.

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Adam.

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This is Paul.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm getting calling from the UK.

280
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, you said, of course.

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I know it sounds.

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Put me this.

283
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Come in line number into your phone.

284
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And then you'll just phone it whenever something comes up.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That you want to comment on.

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And that is exactly what I've done.

287
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Put it in tonight.

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And then something came up.

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Interess in the accessibility of pod show and B.T. pod show.

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And all that good stuff.

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And so far, yet, it has been very much in access to blockchain.

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm talking as a blind person in the screen reader.

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But very excited to hear what you were saying.

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And show five, five.

295
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
About being able to make actually a lot of it.

296
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I love it.

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
My sister, the story was because of the software that you're using.

298
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Having accessibility.

299
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Controls within it.

300
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So looking forward to very much.

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Looking forward to paying loads of good music and all that the pod show has to offer.

302
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And it's a very skydiving.

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So thanks very much.

304
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And this is Paul Hopkins.

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Sign in us.

306
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And you can listen to my podcast.

307
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
www.vipodcasting.lipsing.com.

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
All right.

309
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Take care.

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh, God.

311
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
A blind folder.

312
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Mind you.

313
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yep.

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
When I walked into the office yesterday afternoon, Andrew Grummit was one of the first

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
people I saw.

316
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And he said, Oh, dude.

317
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We're about to push a whole bunch of fixes.

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Accessibility stuff.

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We've got to figure it out.

320
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So we've been working really hard.

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Apparently, it aged Q on this flash stuff.

322
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We got a great tip from a listener.

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I told us that there were all kinds of accessibility options in flash.

324
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So I think we're getting pretty close there.

325
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
To people do take this very seriously.

326
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Believe me.

327
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Believe me.

328
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
As a whole bunch of stuff that that we've been fixed.

329
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I think with every push we do now is like 50 new fixes are going up.

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's really.

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's pretty outrageous.

332
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's cool.

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Saw some interesting numbers.

334
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That was reading through just some news articles and stuff on the plane.

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The first one was this pew internet study.

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where the number of people who have heard a podcast in the past year has double

337
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
from the year before.

338
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's the great news.

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Interestingly enough, mainstream media has picked up on another piece of the report.

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That states that and this, of course, is still something we have to work on.

341
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That states that only 1% of people.

342
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I guess what they're trying to say is only 1% of people have subscribed and download a podcast every day.

343
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think it's a little unclear in in the survey itself.

344
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But mainstream publications have taken that to say.

345
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I've seen headlines like podcasting 15 minutes are up.

346
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, dream on motherfuckers.

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And another statistic that I thought was interesting.

348
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Zoom apparently took a 9% of the portable player marketplace.

349
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Since it's launch.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And that, of course, is being touted as a tremendous failure.

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I don't want to get into the pros and cons of the zoom.

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You know, the iPod has currently now has 63% of the total market in zoom has 9%.

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's just say 10%.

354
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll take 10% of any kind of market like that.

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't think that's bad at all.

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In fact, I was amazed.

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I guess we'll find out the real numbers after the holiday season.

358
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But I think this is whenever you have a market where there's a clear leader,

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
you can always take away, I mean, it's almost literally the same as podcasting.

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What is the global advertiser broadcast advertising market?

361
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What is the US broadcast advertising market?

362
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's tens of billions of dollars.

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm pretty sure.

364
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So, okay.

365
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So if we're taking, was it 12% now or listening to podcasts?

366
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I think we're starting to tap into something really big.

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It'll be quite a while before we put a dent in mainstream advertising and broadcasting.

368
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But come on.

369
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We've only been around for two years.

370
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's podcasting and already 12%.

371
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The zoom only weeks and 9%.

372
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't think that's bad at all.

373
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I had him.

374
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is the long term, long term listener of the DSC.

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Adam, I'm just going to pick you mind.

376
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Me and the good lady were off to Amsterdam on Friday to celebrate my birthday.

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And apart from the usual spots, the red light district,

378
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
one that is that you could recommend a nice place to eat or maybe somewhere to see.

379
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We're staying in a family of big boards called the BoCell,

380
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
not quite sure that's all about the serenity.

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And also as well, I'm a fly from the Newcastle upon time across to Amsterdam.

382
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm just wondering what the connections are like from the airport into the main city centre.

383
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Maybe you could tell me a little bit if you're able to.

384
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Love the show and keep smiling or by the way, the wife's culture and I'm a folder.

385
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know if you want to go to Amsterdam together then.

386
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That could cause problems.

387
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If she scrunches and you folds, you just might want to leave her there, dude.

388
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The BoCell, literally is a hotel that's a boat.

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I have never been on it.

390
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Was this a holiday package that you chose by any chance?

391
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't think you could.

392
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You shouldn't give a shit about that because it's clean and it works.

393
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And it's reasonably located for the city centre, but you are literally on a boat.

394
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But you should be having a lot of fun in the city.

395
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So obviously, the red light district isn't even what it used to be anymore.

396
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
They've closed down large sections of it because of excessive drug trafficking.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
None of the girls are Dutch anymore.

398
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And that was kind of the fun of it.

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You could walk in the red light district and you could wave high to the girls.

400
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And they would speak your language if you were Dutch that is.

401
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And it was how much more fun back in the old days.

402
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You definitely want to go to the light supply.

403
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And part of what you have to have to do as a tourist.

404
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You have to go to the Bulldog.

405
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm sure you've heard of that.

406
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ask them for the menu and have a sample from the menu.

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Although if you were to walk in the lights a strat,

408
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
which is the street right off the lights a plane.

409
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And you walk up, say, I think is it's two bridges.

410
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, if you walk up two bridges and hang a right onto a crab.

411
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I forget the name of the street.

412
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Just ask someone for global chillage.

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Global chillage.

414
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's the coffee shop you want to go to.

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And I just tell them that Adam sent you.

416
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hi Adam.

417
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
How are you doing?

418
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is Aaron from SLV podcast.

419
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I just took a question.

420
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I was only just come across your show in the past couple of weeks.

421
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
In fact, I've been listening to it for about DSC full 50 onwards.

422
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I was just kind of wondering.

423
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Is there any way to listen to all your old shows?

424
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Some of the very very similar to what Rob Goldbeard's top of the podcast has been doing

425
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
his basically just really re-releasing his old shows on the, on the almost old feed?

426
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I was just, I was only wondering purely because it will be great.

427
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think it all shows me.

428
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm chiseled again and on the phone and what I was just saying.

429
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Check out my podcast.

430
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
SLV podcast.

431
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll tell you what you say.

432
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Chiseled again Adam.

433
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Ta-da.

434
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah.

435
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Ta-da.

436
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, obviously, if you go to dataacourceco.com, you can go back in time on the calendar in the archives

437
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and you can select any day you want and see what I was talking about then.

438
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Up the, was the first two weeks of January will be moving.

439
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We'll be moving all of our, all of our stuff into the new cottage.

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And I think that I'm really just going to not work at all because I'm going to have to really

441
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
help a true show and pay a lot of attention to this move because it's been going.

442
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's been way too easy.

443
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We've got to run into some crap somewhere.

444
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So what I'll do there is I'll probably ask people to put together best of Charlie's again.

445
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And maybe we do it a little more organized fashion.

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So we don't have, you know, like five people trying to do a show for one day.

447
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But that's probably, I like that a little bit more.

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We do the best of Charlie's and we mash up bits from from previous shows.

449
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And when we were in Patricia and Christina and I were in Portugal, we had some great

450
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
best of Charlie's that people would together.

451
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It was just absolutely fantastic.

452
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So I think that that's really what I was planning on doing.

453
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But otherwise, you know, be my guest.

454
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And go through the archives.

455
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's only 500 and eight besides this one that you haven't heard, perhaps.

456
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Let's see what else did we have.

457
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Report from the sun that have very, very trustworthy publication in the UK.

458
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I might add apparently in any given 24 hour period.

459
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
20 million Brits come to orgasm.

460
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That didn't sound right.

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
20 million Brits have an orgasm within any 24 hour period.

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You guys are a bunch of horning by the fuckers.

463
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You know, there's a lot of folks out there that claims to be Christian, but they ain't.

464
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But we don't have to debate about what we should think.

465
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
If you were a chef, you wouldn't listen to what Jesus has to say.

466
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He wouldn't be in the mess here at night.

467
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
In a world of sin, a man came to save humanity.

468
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Now, after 2000 years, Jesus has some things to say.

469
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The Jesus interview.

470
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Get your feedback for Jesus.

471
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Coming soon to audioattitude.com.

472
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, glory.

473
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't wait.

474
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The man is coming to talk to us.

475
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Speaking of the man.

476
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Hey, Adam, it's CC Chapman.

477
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
How's it going, man?

478
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Great to see you in London at podcast on UK.

479
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It was cool that we got the cross paths there.

480
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Pink shirt and all.

481
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Right, man?

482
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's all good.

483
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Listen, I want to tell you about something that's pretty cool.

484
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I know you don't play in second life very often anymore, but I wanted to do something

485
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
different this holidays.

486
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I wanted it because I know last year, Potsay for Peace.

487
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Both of us were really big into getting that going and getting it up and getting it live.

488
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I know you're still a huge supporter of the song as I am.

489
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So I thought, wouldn't it be cool if we could bring Potsay for Peace to second life?

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So what I've done is I worked with Brittany Mason to get a little holiday cheer that

491
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I could spread a present that I could give to people.

492
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And what actually happens is when the person gets the present when they open it up, it gives

493
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
them a snowman.

494
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And what happens because I wanted it, you know, non-denominational.

495
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So it could work for every holiday out there.

496
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It puts a you put down a snowman.

497
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And when you click on it, it starts playing the chorus from Potsay for Peace.

498
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But it also opens up a website.

499
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Takes you to Potsay for Peace.org directly.

500
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And also gives you no card explaining what the charity is, how it worked.

501
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And encouraging people where they can go to buy the song for 99 cents and where it

502
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
how it benefits.

503
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So if you see one of these little snowman floating around second life, click on it.

504
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And support Potsay for Peace.

505
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's a great song.

506
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Slow.

507
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm still amazed at what he did with it.

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And all the artists took part in it.

509
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think it just is a testament to the power of podcasting and new marketing across the board.

510
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And I think it's great.

511
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I knew you'd be, I knew you would dig it even though you're not in second life a lot.

512
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Because we've now brought, you know, we've crossed another threshold into yet another medium

513
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
for this to get played and hopefully open it up to new people.

514
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And it gives you a perfect opportunity to play it, right?

515
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Because that's what we're all about.

516
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So I'm going to get out of here.

517
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I just wanted to let you know.

518
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Peace and be wild men and hopefully see you soon.

519
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
All right.

520
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So you see.

521
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You're a folder or scruncher.

522
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I don't think I ever ask you that.

523
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I folks listening to this on serious satellite radio stars one

524
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
to the stars channel.

525
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Go to Podsive.

526
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
PodsafeRepease.org.

527
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So you can listen to that fantastic song.

528
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Which, of course, was a collaboration that we put together last year of,

529
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
was it 30 different Podsive Music artists?

530
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
First winter snow outside my window.

531
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Feels like at that time again to be.

532
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The mistletoe.

533
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
A Christmas show.

534
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And the lighting of that famous Christmas tree.

535
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
People are shopping for their loved ones.

536
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm making plans for a Christmas tree.

537
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But it all goes by.

538
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And the wind goes by.

539
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And then we have to wait another year.

540
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What if every day?

541
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Christmas?

542
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What are one and the more?

543
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
This one tree.

544
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It will never feel blue.

545
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
We make all our dreams come true.

546
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
If Christmas were every day.

547
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

548
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I just look around now and you will see it.

549
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Everybody's nice and full of light.

550
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And they get to those who are in need.

551
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What if every day?

552
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Christmas?

553
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What are one and the more?

554
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This would be.

555
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It will never feel blue.

556
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We make all our dreams come true.

557
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
If Christmas were every day.

558
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

559
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We make all our dreams come true.

560
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It will never feel blue.

561
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We make all our dreams come true.

562
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It will never feel blue.

563
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It will never feel blue.

564
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We make all our dreams come true.

565
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
What if every day?

566
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It will never feel blue.

567
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We make all our dreams come true.

568
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
If Christmas was every day.

569
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What if every day?

570
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Christmas?

571
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What are one and the more?

572
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This would be.

573
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It will never feel blue.

574
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
We make all our dreams come true.

575
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If Christmas was every day.

576
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

577
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We make all our dreams come true.

578
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We make all our dreams come true.

579
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It will never feel blue.

580
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
We're in the sky, every day

581
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We fly, every day

582
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
We fly, every day

583
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We fly, every day

584
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We fly, every day

585
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We fly, every day

586
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We fly, every day

587
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We fly, every year

588
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Chris Morillips

589
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Chris Morillips

590
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Googling his Star

591

Chris

592

Chris Morillips

593
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,280
So chants

594
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh man, we're gonna be cool if in like, you know, I don't know, 50 years, we're all dead and

595
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,360
people still play that song. Wouldn't that be fucking cool? They could certainly happen.

596
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Pods say for peace, what if every day we're Christmas, uh, put together by, well, masterminded

597
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,200
by by slow. Uh, we had the 30 or 40 different Pods say music artists across the globe all sending

598
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,560
in their individual pieces, all put together like a big huge jigsaw puzzle, and that's the

599
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,400
result, which of course you can find on the Podsave Music Network and all the songs that we play

600
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,480
on the daily source code available in the show notes, a daily source code.com. Okay, uh, so the first holiday

602
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,280
investors in Pods show, uh, they have a lot of investments in very interesting companies, uh, so who knows

603
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,480
who will bump? They got a lot of people that hang around and, uh, like Robin Williams, Oprah,

604
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,760
Bono, uh, I hope some of these people are there. Don't tell me it's all going to be
