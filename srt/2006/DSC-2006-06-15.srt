00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Transmitters?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We don't need no sticking turns, didn't you?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Autistic, it's Adam Curry.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The car is the place that comes with a sample.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Look, you sounded about 12 years old.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You sounded like you didn't even find it all right.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But you pop a beat just because.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I didn't have a car to say to God,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
God, I didn't love my thing.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought you knew it would be this way.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I got married on my day.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Don't come up.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Instead of wanting to go,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't act my age.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We between the words,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
everything that was good.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's got to have a last day.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I didn't have a thought to say,

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
God, I didn't love my thing.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought you knew it would be this way.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I got married on my day.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But I have to want my understands.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
When it doesn't feel wrong to me.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When you're busy making other plans.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I got married on my day.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I didn't have a thought to say,

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
God, I didn't love my thing.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I didn't have a thought to say,

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
God, I didn't love my thing.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I didn't have a thought to say,

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
God, I didn't love my thing.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I thought you knew it would be this way.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I got married on my day.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I thought you knew it would be this way.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I didn't have a thought to say,

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
God, I didn't love my thing.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I thought you knew it would be this way.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I got married on my day.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I got to have to want my understands.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When it doesn't feel wrong to me.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I thought you knew it would be this way.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I got married on my day.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Gentlemen losers.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I got married on my day.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's pot safe.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's from the network.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No one has the pot safe.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Music network.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Everybody, how you doing?

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Welcome to my humble abode in Northern California.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Beautiful day today in San Francisco.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The sun is shining.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can see all the way up to the mountains.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Clear across the bay.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I got a 180 degree view in the penthouse.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Which is perfect.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I just got no chicks.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Reading from their bio.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Gentlemen losers started on a drunken weekend in 1995.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And continues to this day.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Chris Cannon and Harvey Barham.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
On the band after a four track weekend session at Cannon's apartment.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And now ten years eight albums later.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The two continues songwriting producing is the gentleman losers.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, like that.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Nice song to kind of kick everything off with.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, let me say how incredibly sorry I am.

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Then I didn't get a show out to yesterday.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It was actually quite sad.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everything all put together.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Of course Tuesday we had a show.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We had 403 and put in a full day at the office.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And Ron and Martin.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I decided to go to have some dinner.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So I driven to the office.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ron is walking these days from knob hill.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And if you know San Francisco going from knob hill to south of

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
market.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's about a 30 minute walk and going home, of course,

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
is a killer because it's all uphill.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it really is the hill.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you know what I mean.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I said, dude, you know the restaurant's near your place.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hop in Trinity, I brought her right here.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But of course, Tuesday morning, she had started up as normal.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And just made me feel so good.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So we hopped in and through our bags in the back.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And you got to know that we really appreciate engineering both of us.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We like engines and cars and just the beauty of it.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It doesn't have to be beautiful on the outside.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
As long as it's beautiful on the inside.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And we're driving up.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And this right about the top of the hill there.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There's a 45 degree angle.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't believe I'm so stupid.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We actually, we did something in aviation that calls it.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That we call inviting the boogie man in.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now he said, hey, she's running really nice, isn't she?

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, well, that was the big mistake, of course.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
At the stop sign, top the hill, 45 degree angle.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Coup.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Transmission drops out.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can't go forward.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can only go on reverse.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You can imagine that this is not good on a one way street

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in San Francisco on a 45 degree inclined.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So, you know, it kind of made it fun at the same time.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And what it was, it was messed up.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And we actually contemplated driving around reverse all the way back down to the office.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And I think if we had been younger men, we probably would have done that.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But in this case, it seemed that the tow truck was a bad idea.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So we did get Trinity back to the office.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And the doctor has already come to take a look.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And it looks like she needs a complete transmission overhaul.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Which I knew was coming because she was shifting kind of rough since the day I got her.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So, oh well, it'll all be for the better, I guess.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And of course, this will actually motivate me and others around me to get Trinity completely pumped.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Or should I say pimp?

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, let's say pimp.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Beautiful music in the background, by the way.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You may recognize back in the daily source code.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Used to play the rock mining off mix open.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And Luke Stanley sent me this version, which let me see.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What do you say here?

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's a PC chose to play with piano first, because he thought about me and the intro from back then.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And he plays it on the most recent episode of his video cast.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He plays in cello, but cello journey is name of the podcast.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
cello journey.com.

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So it's him Luke Stanley on the cello.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And in this case, pianist and friend Ross English on piano.

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I thought it really went well with the whole Trinity story.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Which, of course, doesn't end there because the woes have to continue.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, after all this, it's like 1130.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so, I get back.

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I do my show prep, because I do this early in the morning.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's just a little past 7am to hit all the satellite windows, et cetera.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go to bed.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You know, I'm up at like 530.

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
536 o'clock.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And I realize I've left the power adapter to the, to Shiba laptop,

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
which is what I'm producing the entire show on.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's say, oh, let's say a moment brought to you by accident hash.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I noticed that I've left the power adapter at the office.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So, you know, we had a meeting at 9 o'clock, so it was completely hose.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No way I was going to be able to go to the office without the car, of course.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If I had had Trinity, I would have jumped in, and what do you care?

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We got to show you on going on today.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Um, I'm, well, you know, it's not really bad news, but there's just all kinds of crappy stuff happened in success.

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And now Patricia and I, when she was here last time, just what is it two weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago,

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
we went out to buy me the furniture that we're still missing from the, from the condo,

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
which means I have a dining table chairs, discuss that with you the other day.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The chairs are nice to have, and this baker's rack, which is going to be this set up for the studio.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And they're supposed to come on Wednesday the 14th, and there's actually, you know,

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
as the documentation says, we'll call you 24 hours ahead of time to schedule within a four hour window,

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
when we're going to drop the stuff off.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And of course, they didn't call, you know, we went through this when I just got the condo,

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
all the stuff that never arrived.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So, uh, I got Rosie on the case at the office, and they said, oh, well, yeah, no, um,

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
it's not in stock, and we'll just have to delay that until June 24th.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I saw the stuff, I asked specifically, you know, you got to drive to get to Levit,

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
it's like, you know, it was like a 15 minute drive from here off the highway,

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and it was in stock, it was there in the store room.

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They promised me time and time again.

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And it's like, they don't even call, you've got to call, you've got to figure out what's going on.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, well, you know, we'll just schedule that for July the 24th.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you, and please make sure you listen to the daily source code tomorrow.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Dorks.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So they're refunding my money.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And now, of course, that doesn't do me any good, because you can't sit on bank rolls.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, I guess you could.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey Adam, this is Bridget with the D, the latest addition to your pod show team.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've been familiarizing myself with the site, and I came, uh, the pod sake music network,

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and I came across a band that Steve and I agree would be perfect for your next show.

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And this is a Steve of the Stephen Mark,

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
social scientists who we have working at the at HQ.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And Bridget and I actually have not been formally introduced.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was expecting Steve and Mark to do that yesterday,

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but I, uh, there's not, I think we're very male heavy at the office.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So having women walk around, you know, you do kind of notice.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So Bridget, uh, I hope we get to meet each other personally today.

194
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And, uh, G, you know, the mood that I mean regarding Levits?

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hmm, yeah.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I think it's time to play just 30 seconds of Big Mountain Fudge Cake.

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And God hates penguins.

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I, you may want to be careful with those bugs in your ear.

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
God hates penguins, I hate you too.

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
God hates penguins, I hate you too.

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
God hates penguins, I hate you too.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
God hates penguins, I hate you too.

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
God hates penguins, I hate you too.

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You know, we got to use that every single time I'm really pissed off about something.

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So Levits, God hates penguins, and he hates you.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hi Adam, it's Gary from New Jersey.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I've left you another message previously.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I just wanted to say that I really enjoy listening to your podcast.

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I listen to it every morning on the way to work.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I have about an hour of drive to work and it really did.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's not a pleasant drive and it really does.

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It does make the time go very, very nicely.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I especially encourage that I guess the diversity of the podcast.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I certainly enjoy the geeky stuff.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But I also enjoy the conversations between you and Patricia.

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
She sounds like a lovely woman and you both sound like you're very much a love.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's very nice.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I really enjoy the podcast and I don't have a podcast to promote.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I just enjoy listening.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Take care.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You're happy about the good work.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Gary, thank you very much from New Jersey.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I just love it when listeners call in.

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So he didn't really have much to say other than that.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He loves it, which is cool.

226
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But I just like it when listeners call.

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If you're a listener and you want to contribute because, you know,

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
most listeners don't have microphones and everything set up to send in feedback.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Not a problem.

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We've got voicemail lines for you.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And I'm just kind of talking here covering for myself as I'm trying to find the voicemail numbers.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Here we go.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We have a number in the United States and New Jersey,

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
201, 65, 65, 65, 7.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Go ahead, put that in your phone right now.

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And then as you store it, just put in the Charlie or just Charlie.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Or Adam, which would be the top of the list.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No, don't do that because I get so many butt phones.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
My name being Adam being at the top of people's list.

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't count the number of butt phone calls.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I get someone sits on their phone and then it just dials whatever is handy,

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
which is usually the top of the list, which is usually A.

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Which is usually me.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
In London, we have a phone number for you.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
O2O76813753.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Lots of stuff going on at the office as well for Pod Show UK.

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's getting so exciting.

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I guess we're going to have another whole delegation coming over in the next couple of weeks.

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And it's going to go fast.

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It really is.

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We're going to start cranking into pretty high gear pretty soon now.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And it's all of course going to come together.

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And I've told you about my stay here being really,

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
you know, the, how we're just, the final touches are being put on before we can go public data.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And it's still going to be fucked up and broken and full of wards and burps and nooks and crannies that are all wrong.

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, it's okay.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But got a lot of people really excited about it.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And that would be the people who've been working on it for 10 months at this point.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hey, last night, by the way, I had dinner with the Emily Morris.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I've talked about her before.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And in fact, it's funny. Emily is she turned down an offer from Pod Show to join the network.

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
She had a podcast called The Sex with Emily Podcast.

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I really like what she was doing.

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And I thought she really had a way of connecting with her listeners.

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I think her numbers were pretty darn good as well from what I remember telling me.

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But she, just around the time that we were talking to her about joining the network.

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
She was looking at a couple of different things that she's, I think she also an actress.

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
In fact, she is, she's in the movie. I'm a sex addict.

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You got to see that. That's pretty funny. It's getting like critical acclaim.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm a sex addict the movie.com.

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But she's now on, what is it?

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Free FM 106 here in San Francisco.

273
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's owned by Infinity CBS.

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So it's old media, right?

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And they actually provide podcast versions of her show.

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Which don't really work for me because it's a call-in show.

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And it's about sex. But wow, what I realize, listening to that.

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And I'll have to listen to her live on Saturday if I can find a radio.

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I guess I'll have to sit in the car to listen to the radio.

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If I have Trinity back by then, she actually is at a very, you know,

281
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
where this nexus of mainstream media where it's not satisfying listeners,

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
where we're completely, you know, going off in one direction.

283
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And the audience is running towards podcasting and podcasting is running towards the audience.

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
At the same time, I think that there's a very few things that we can't compete with.

285
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And when it comes to asynchronous media like podcasting, the live aspect,

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
you know, I always say if we find a song I've been loud and don't go running to your iPod

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
because you're going to be disappointed at that very moment.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The next day, you'll have all kinds of cool stuff to listen to.

289
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
When it comes to live, particularly people in cars with cell phones,

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
who just want to talk to someone, it really works.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I think that she, it's how it's strange as it sounds.

292
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think that she really is the future of terrestrial radio.

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's all this other stuff that you're hearing.

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's got to simplify.

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Radio has to really change their ways.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And it'll, you know, I'm following her.

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But anyway, I was really nice and went to a great restaurant,

298
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
which I'm finding out that, you know, around the condo,

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
there is kind of, you know, there's some nice places.

300
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What is it?

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The boulevard, which is right off, it's a mission and near-embarked arrow.

302
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Wow, great food.

303
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
She makes me, she made me laugh very much.

304
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
She's like totally out of her mind.

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So anyway.

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Soccer.

307
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's coming up.

308
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This weekend, big, big game.

309
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And I think a couple of pod showers are going to get together

310
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and watch the game.

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And if you want to know more about the world cup, as you know,

312
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't care about soccer, except one of the world cup,

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
or maybe the European championship.

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't even like the champion league.

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But I do have an update for it.

316
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Hi, I'm Mrs. Phil.

317
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And this is Tony.

318
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We're from the Soccer Show podcast available at SoccerShow.com.

319
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let's get caught up, mate.

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let's do, because we're almost at the end of the first round of group games.

321
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let's do a round of what we've seen so far.

322
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The big games and the big teams.

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What stood out for you so far?

324
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think going all the way back, I think to that very first game

325
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
to turn them at Germany against Costa Rica.

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Six goals in the open and game of a World Cup finals.

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You can't beat that.

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, I'm just going to jump in here and say, oh, yeah.

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I mean, particularly because the games are being hosted in Germany.

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I think the Germans are real happy with what's going on there.

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And then we had England on the Saturday.

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They'd be Paraguay, one nail.

334
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It wasn't a great game.

335
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It wasn't a great performance.

336
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But it was the result.

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
England needed Colin Beat, Serbian, Montenegro, one nail.

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah.

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Even though that wasn't a fantastic score,

340
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
because it, you know, I guess it's,

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
depending on how many goals you score,

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
that's how many points you get.

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I never understand any of the scoring stuff.

344
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But man, Robin, Ryan Robin, who is the Dutcher,

345
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
what does he use as a striker?

346
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is he, I think, as a striker?

347
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Wow, man.

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Guy was on fire.

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It was just, it was beautiful to watch him.

350
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And if only Ruit von Nisselroy could have jumped in,

351
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
then they would probably have scored a couple more goals.

352
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Looks like a really narrow result,

353
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
but I thought Holland would tremendous.

354
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

355
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Then we had OOCH, USA, NILL,

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Czech Republic.

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, yeah.

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's right.

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It just doesn't look good now for the USA.

361
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That gold difference could be a killer for them.

362
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I think it's still doing the game.

363
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
They could still do it.

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And Italy got the result they needed again.

365
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You know, none of the big teams

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
have really looked at dominating so far.

367
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm going to fast forward to today's game,

368
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Brazil, one nail against Croatia.

369
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Brazil didn't look that handy for me.

370
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Czech Republic, for me, has been the best team that I've seen.

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Over the next couple of days,

372
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
we're actually going to go into the,

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
the first of the second round games on

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
way to stay.

375
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We've got Germany against Poland.

376
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Which match?

377
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Absolutely huge historically.

378
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Great match.

379
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Germany's backline definitely looks dodgy.

380
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So it could be an interest in one.

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's funny.

382
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I haven't heard from comics to blogger about that game yet.

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Then Thursday,

384
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
we have England versus Trinidad and Tobago.

385
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Should be an easy one for England.

386
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It should be the game that guarantees their passage into the next round.

387
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Friday, there's a few good ones because it's our favorite group.

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I think.

389
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Group C, Argentina versus Serbia, Montenegro.

390
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And then Holland versus the Ivory Coast.

391
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So I'm really looking forward to Friday.

392
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think Friday.

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't agree.

394
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah.

395
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't agree.

396
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No secret.

397
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The fight that I'm back in Holland for this one.

398
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I want to see them soon too.

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, and hopefully see a few goals in that one.

400
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
All those games we've mentioned are on ESPN 2, by the way.

401
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The year list of them is during the week is on ESPN 2.

402
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And all the games is coming weekend or on ABC in the United States.

403
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
A side day of course.

404
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's the Italy versus the United States.

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's three o'clock Eastern time in the US.

406
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And Rudy, it's a must win.

407
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I've been trying to work out how the USA could go through with a draw.

408
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And I don't think with a goal difference they have.

409
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't think it's going to happen.

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So they really need to come out and beat Italy.

411
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then Sunday, I think the game of the day is going to be Brazil versus Australia.

412
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The two teams that win their opening matches.

413
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Okay.

414
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I think that's God's caught up.

415
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Check it out.

416
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And that is your subscription list.

417
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Wherever it's soccershout.com.

418
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
All right, guys.

419
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Thank you very much.

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I look forward to your next update.

421
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah.

422
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Saturday.

423
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So that's going to be fun.

424
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I think that the US actually, I got hope.

425
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
They got clobbered in that first game.

426
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But I really feel that the Italians are out there.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They're probably thinking how are you asking up.

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And they're going to come out with their big swing index.

429
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But do not underestimate the yank.

430
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Do not underestimate them.

431
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Some more UK feedback here.

432
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Go.

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Hey.

434
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There's a question for you from the West Coast.

435
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
One thing about England.

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I hear that you can't buy cider and beer in the same pine glass in England.

437
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Is this true?

438
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And you've said, how do you explain that?

439
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A second question on legal subjects in Holland.

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You cannot.

441
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
To a moment.

442
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So first of all, is that what's called the snake bite?

443
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know if that's illegal or not.

444
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I've had one.

445
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I've had one here in San Francisco.

446
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This by the way is a K2.

447
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's Kevin ready from pod show.

448
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's not like I didn't know he was going to call in with this question.

449
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But he said, could you ask your listeners?

450
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If snake bite is illegal in the UK, it's a dude.

451
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You've got the voicemail line.

452
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Give me a call.

453
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I hear that they're going to be following Ireland and preventing people from smoking in public places.

454
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
How will this impact copy shops?

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And if it does impact copy shops and you're forced to smoke either neat or do without.

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Would you alter your smoking habit accordingly if it's supposed to?

457
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's it.

458
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Good luck with Charlie.

459
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hope to hear it too.

460
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Bye.

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah.

462
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well, this is going to happen worldwide.

463
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And I think it's pretty much a good thing.

464
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Smoking in public places.

465
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's just doesn't work anymore.

466
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I get it.

467
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I've been a lifelong smoke, I guess.

468
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And in the States, I really enjoy it.

469
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You know, that's where there are places in California where you can't smoke on the beach.

470
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I'm all for it.

471
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And it's good, you know, don't get mad just to get even.

472
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And don't get mad just deal with it.

473
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You can do whatever you want in your own home.

474
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So now will it what'll happen in the Netherlands?

475
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Man, the coffee shops are dying breed.

476
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You can no longer sell a coffee shop.

477
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
A coffee shop, by the way, for those who don't know, is not where you buy coffee in Amsterdam or in the rest of Holland.

478
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's where you buy marijuana and it's legal or it's fuzzy.

479
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But you don't get arrested for it.

480
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
As I said, they're dying breed.

481
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You legally can now not sell a coffee shop, the someone who will then continue the coffee shop.

482
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So when all the current owners die, then it's just going to be over.

483
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And quite honestly, you know, Europe can't sell this anymore on a pan European level.

484
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They can't be the only country who is not outlawed this particular plant.

485
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So they're going to clamp down.

486
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's going to be over.

487
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It will be.

488
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But maybe in 50 years from now, people understand really what that plant does and what it can do.

489
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I'll tell you, man, my mom has me make special tea whenever I come over.

490
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
She's really starting to dig this stuff.

491
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
All right, just a couple minutes before we hit the satellite window.

492
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I wanted to play for you.

493
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Another entry for our EarthLink ad challenge.

494
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I talked about this one on Tuesday's show.

495
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Remember, this is advertising made by you, right?

496
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So no longer is EarthLink telling you how great their service is.

497
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The podcasts are not telling you how great their service is or what their service is about.

498
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But actually users are telling you about it.

499
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
My name is Rachelle Kumar and I am about to tell you the one story of how I found EarthLink service

500
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
when I was 11 years old.

501
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So here's a setting.

502
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's a year 2002.

503
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I am in the sixth grade as an 11 year old kid.

504
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, my family is looking for internet service and my dad completely gives up saying nothing's affordable and

505
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
giving you true high speed.

506
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Like, dad, that is a lie.

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I look around on slow, cruddy dial up and here it is.

508
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
EarthLink high speed internet.

509
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Back then, in 2002, 49.95 a month for three megabits per second.

510
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That was top of the line.

511
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We ordered it and we got that email client.

512
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We got anti virus.

513
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We got firewall and to spy where everything, the whole package.

514
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And I'm proud to say ever since 2002, we are proud.

515
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
EarthLink subscribers.

516
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Come on.

517
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If in 11 year old kid can make the right decision, I think you can too.

518
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Fantastic.

519
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That's great.

520
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Go to adchallenge.podshow.com and you can enter with an endorsement.

521
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You can enter with anything, really.

522
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Just whatever you think will work.

523
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But we have categories and it's what we have endorsement.

524
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
We have a commercial spot like produced and we have a song or a jingle.

525
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And PWFenton, by the way, is indeed one of the judges.

526
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I played something that hadn't actually been approved for the judges yet.

527
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And he was like, hey man, don't have people send that to you directly.

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I said, no, it was sent into the adchallenge site.

529
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I just kind of felt it out there.

530
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
If you're checking us out on serious stars 102, Pacific Coast, Hellway is next.

531
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And of course, I'll be back with you for the Friday festivities here on the Charlie,

532
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
which will be tomorrow.

533
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Take care, everybody.

534
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And for you still hanging out, I've got another one for you.

535
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is cool.

536
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The reverse engineers, you may have heard them on this show.

537
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You can find them on the Podsake Music Network.

538
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, they checked in with their own song for Earthling.

539
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I think what is it to hold on.

540
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The ID3 tags aren't showing up.

541
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Let me just see if I can find it here.

542
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Crap, hold on.

543
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
See, this is sucks.

544
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
All right.

545
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Oh, man.

546
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I have to open up in a quick time window to actually see what the ID3 tags say.

547
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That's funny.

548
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Last blast, I think, should do the bandwidth conservation society.

549
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay.

550
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That's a reverse engineers with their throw at $2,000.

551
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Ready, you want to go today.

552
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I heard my computer say everywhere.

553
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Take me there.

554
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
With every single one of you.

555
00:25:45,000 --> 00:26:06,000
There's a lot of creativity out there.

556
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I tell you, add challenge.podshow.com.

557
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Stuff really is working.

558
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's so cool to see everyone putting their ideas together.

559
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It doesn't have to be a highly technically produced piece.

560
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It can be anything at all as long as it's done like six megabytes.

561
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You should be able to do that.

562
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
There's more working and advertising.

563
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We do talk about that from time to time.

564
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
This whole GoDaddy promotion has been running across the network.

565
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We have all these codes.

566
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
If you go out and use one of those promotional codes.

567
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
For instance, you can get a domain name from GoDaddy.

568
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
If you use the code DSC3.

569
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Now the way this works is our podcasters on the network.

570
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Of course, they're compensated for doing that.

571
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We call in the advertising business for every conversion.

572
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
In other words, every single fan listener, audience member who's listening to the show,

573
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
their favorite podcasters says, yeah, I'm going to go get me a piece of the internet.

574
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And usually register something weird.

575
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Like, what was it for CC Chapman, Mark Yoshimura Nemkov,

576
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
from PCH registered corporateradiosucks.com or something like that.

577
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The code that's used actually money goes to the podcast.

578
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I found out that we've converted like 5,000 domain names.

579
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's an unbelievable.

580
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This is a runaway success.

581
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And I knew that it would work.

582
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But I had no idea that, well, I did.

583
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What's really happening is we're leaving the messaging up to the individual producer

584
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
of the individual podcast.

585
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Who knows how to talk to their audience.

586
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Screw this one spot fits all thing.

587
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And it's really working.

588
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I got to tell you.

589
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's exciting because that boads well for the future podcasting.

590
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Hi, this is Kurt Cohen from Belgium.

591
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I was catching up with a Friday show on Monday morning.

592
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
When I was traveling to the moment, man, he did some mental programming there.

593
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
As soon as I got out of the year, I started my ice,

594
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and keenly started stopping boobs.

595
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I had to put my sunglasses on to get enough to the market.

596
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I hope you caught that.

597
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I was talking about with the warm weather in London that there's just

598
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Wald.

599
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I was talking with Patricia about that.

600
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
There's just Waldowall boobs everywhere.

601
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh, man.

602
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
English women like showing them off.

603
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yep.

604
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Sunglasses are required.

605
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
The colleagues.

606
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well, female colleagues.

607
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
In case you're missing London while you're in the US.

608
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Here's a good tip.

609
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
After last year's test run, we just launched a new series of

610
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
the London-based podcast.

611
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's a podcast with loads of interesting tips for anybody

612
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
taking a break in London.

613
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The second series consists of two versions, one in Dutch,

614
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and one in French nowals.

615
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So that's brand new.

616
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
As it's a commercial initiative for one of our

617
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
customer to see your restaurant, we had a hell of a job getting

618
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
a couple of six years again to it because of the commercial

619
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
aspect even though the branding is extremely light.

620
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
We had to get sign contracts from each group member and each

621
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
record company for those who have already had one.

622
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Listen to this.

623
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This is really cool.

624
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So his client is Euro starts.

625
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The train that runs all across France and Germany and

626
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
the Netherlands and whatever.

627
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's fast train.

628
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Take your straight to Disneyland.

629
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And so they're putting together some kind of marketing materials.

630
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And he went to the Podsiff Music Network and contacted

631
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
each of the bands and the members to get permission.

632
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And I presume he played them as well to license the music to

633
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
put into their marketing.

634
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
It's great dude.

635
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I can't tell you how much I appreciate you thinking of the PMN.

636
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I thought this might just interest you.

637
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Because there is a demand on the commercial side for,

638
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
for about 16 years it could be used in,

639
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and this call it the semi commercial podcast.

640
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So anybody who understands that your French serves to

641
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
www.uristard.com slash the London dates and

642
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
subscribe to the feed.

643
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Thanks, bye.

644
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So if you're kind of new listening to podcasts and you're

645
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
wondering, well, what exactly are this?

646
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
There's only two questions I really get from people.

647
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So what does Podsiff Music and what does this

648
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and say a thing all about?

649
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
This and say a thing another time.

650
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Podsiff Music Network though.

651
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
This is me.

652
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
God.

653
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Since you.

654
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The Podsiff Music Network was devised really to create a place

655
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
where artists can come together with podcasters.

656
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's really the main.

657
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And there's a subpart to it, of course,

658
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
for listeners who want to find out more about the artist,

659
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
perhaps by an MP3, et cetera.

660
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But it's all about the licensing.

661
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And this is the thing that mainstream media and the record industry

662
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
or really the record industry has not been able to figure out

663
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
is, you know, without breaking their own rules,

664
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
how do they get this music in the hands of podcasters

665
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
because, yeah, because it's a podcasters down low,

666
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
which means people could steal it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

667
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It goes nowhere.

668
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Although there are, you know, what we're seeing now

669
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
is there are many artists who own their own stuff.

670
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You know, you have to own your own stuff.

671
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Usually if you're with a record company,

672
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
the record company owns your material.

673
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And they're the ones that make all the decisions.

674
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But if you own your own stuff, you can write a license

675
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
to anybody you want.

676
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It could be for Eurostar or could be for podcasts.

677
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
We've just made it simple where you sign up.

678
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You put your stuff up.

679
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The licenses in place and you're protected.

680
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But there is some confusion.

681
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So this guy really got it right.

682
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know, he went out and licensed everything.

683
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
This other piece of feedback I received really important

684
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
that you listen to what's going on here because it's not right.

685
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And it is in violation of the pod save music network terms.

686
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And it's good that this comes up.

687
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Because of course, there's no malice intended.

688
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But we do have to discuss this.

689
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So listen to this.

690
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
How do you add them?

691
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
This is David from the Catholic Family podcast at catholicfamilypodcast.com.

692
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And I have some questions for you today.

693
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Recently, we created a companion feed to a regular podcast that contains

694
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
all of the pod safe music that we play sorted by episode.

695
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Since we play mostly Christian rock, the theory is that this music

696
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
only feed makes downloading the songs into a playlist

697
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
convenient for our subscribers.

698
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Since we're giving attribution for the songs in the feed,

699
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
including a link to the artist.

700
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And we're using them in a non-commercial manner.

701
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I would think that this would be an acceptable use of pod safe music.

702
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Recently, I noticed that the pod safe music network that there was a message

703
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
at the bottom of my podcasting page that read,

704
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
we have removed XML feed due to abuse by some users.

705
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
We are currently working on other options.

706
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm guessing that podcasters were using this feed to point their subscribers

707
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
to pod safe music, which would mean that the subscribers were downloading

708
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
many times the number of files that would be downloaded

709
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
in the podcasters were downloading them.

710
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Now, I believe that we as podcasters should share the load.

711
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So I've made copies of all of our podcasters and put them in our server

712
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
so that I'm not taking advantage of your servers.

713
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
These are the files that our music feed references.

714
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Here are my questions.

715
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Is it becoming a common practice for podcasters to create

716
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
companion feeds for this purpose?

717
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Do you think it is a legitimate use of pod safe music to provide this?

718
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And if so, should podcasters share the load,

719
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
especially considering the imminent launch of the PDN,

720
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
or is this something that you will support?

721
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Bye for now.

722
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
All right, so let's step back.

723
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
No, not okay, not legal use of the material.

724
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
My microphone should.

725
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay, so essentially, if I understand correctly what you're doing

726
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
is you're using music in the show and then as a service to your listeners,

727
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
you've created a companion feed, which if you subscribe to it,

728
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
then those songs, the actual MP3s will drop into your podcatcher.

729
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You know, it'll come into your iTunes or whatever.

730
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
No, not allowed, go reread the terms and conditions.

731
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You're only allowed to use these songs in a new form.

732
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And the legalese is, it's not even that legal actually when you read it,

733
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
but it can only be in a new form of work.

734
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So you can't actually take the file itself and in fact it says,

735
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
you may not redistribute these that way.

736
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You can't just take the file and give it away again.

737
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's completely wrong.

738
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And if you think about it, use some common sense.

739
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
No, you cannot do that.

740
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I think about the XML link, which was actually was quite nice,

741
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
because I used that a lot.

742
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
If you add something to your playlist as a producer, as a podcaster,

743
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
then that would become automatically part of a feed.

744
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And so I could then have all the songs that I've played come into my computer

745
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
automatically, so it have the nicely organized et cetera.

746
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And of course, what people were either doing or finding out is they were

747
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
figuring out where these feeds were and they just subscribed to them.

748
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And you just get free music all day.

749
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So no, you cannot do that.

750
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Please remove the companion feed.

751
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm happy you asked.

752
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But as nothing to do with servers or bandwidth,

753
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
it's just, it's not what the license says.

754
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's not what the agreement is.

755
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Okay.

756
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So the whole point of the podsaid music network or the way it's

757
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
supposed to function is when you play a song.

758
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You report that to the network so the artist knows that he was played

759
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
or the band was played.

760
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And you put a link in your show notes so that listeners can go over

761
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
find out about the artist, listen to other songs.

762
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And if they want, they can actually purchase the MP3.

763
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So I think you know that if you have purchasing there and you're giving away

764
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
away, that's not those two things don't go together.

765
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So please don't be giving away the music in that manner.

766
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It is not yours to give away.

767
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It is yours to use within a new piece of work,

768
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
which would be a podcast or a video podcast.

769
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Almost anything else you can think of,

770
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
but not as individual original files.

771
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Thank you.

772
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Hey y'all, you podcast fans out there.

773
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
This is Michael O'D.

774
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Of most people are D days.

775
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But do you know that this week's episode of most people are D days?

776
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
We'll be my 50th episode.

777
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And I'll be celebrating it by giving you

778
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
a special extended mix by yours truly.

779
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So check it out on Monday,

780
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
June 19th at www.mostpeplodejays.com

781
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
where everyone is a critic and most people are D days.

782
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Especially Michael O'D.

783
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Hey y'all, I don't get you out from what's outside of you

784
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and the podcast and both the name and second life

785
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and also the data cast.

786
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Hey look, good to see you in second life this afternoon at the brothel.

787
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Riding the ball, I'm still cleaning bull poop off my shoes,

788
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but a little virtual bull poop off my virtual shoes.

789
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But anyway, I think last time I saw you with that

790
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
the Potio Palace opening, which by the way,

791
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
episode 87 of Love House Radio,

792
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I did do my sound scene tour of the opening.

793
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Nothing exciting, but kind of neat to play with.

794
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
While the window is the palace,

795
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
when we were going to see some performances,

796
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
maybe some pot-tap artists or something

797
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
that nature just kind of curious.

798
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I felt like a exciting concept to get like a

799
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
adjustment in their play and or something like that.

800
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Didn't know if I was off the mailing list or if I was still in the works,

801
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
but just wanted to check in with you.

802
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Again, good seeing you.

803
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And we'll talk to you soon.

804
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yeah, PD, thank you man.

805
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
He's really been very helpful with the stuff

806
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
that I've been thinking about doing in second life.

807
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This is my wife makes me say this every single time.

808
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's the virtual world second life.

809
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's a game, but then it's not really

810
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and then it is again kind of it's a chat environment.

811
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's a place where people get together.

812
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
There's so many technical and technological limitations

813
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
to this that, you know,

814
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm still trying to figure out what exactly to do.

815
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I have come up with a plan with the,

816
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
well, most of you who are in second life

817
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
have probably seen Brittany Mason.

818
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So Brittany and I've come up with a plan

819
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and we're working with a couple of people on,

820
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
on making something happen that I think will facilitate all this.

821
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You know, we had the palace idea.

822
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But the technical limitations, oh sorry.

823
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The technical limitations just really don't make it possible.

824
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
More than like 30 people hanging around at one time.

825
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So this is some stuff that we're doing to up that number

826
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and to really make a community place

827
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
where we have a lot more control over what's happening

828
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
because I get so sick and tired of, you know,

829
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
shit appearing and stuff blowing up

830
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and they're definitely, you know,

831
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
my castle has been destroyed several times.

832
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like, no one knows mysteriously how it happened.

833
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So I just had no patience for that.

834
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm all for trying to make something happen there,

835
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
but not if all this crap goes down

836
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and if it just doesn't work right.

837
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So I'll keep you up to speed on that,

838
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
but it'll probably be,

839
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it'll probably be another week or two before anything

840
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
really worth mentioning is,

841
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
it's going to take place.

842
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And of course, as always, when it rains,

843
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
it pours, it all comes together because

844
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
the Podgeau Plus, Podsafe,

845
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
the Podcast delivery network,

846
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
everything coming together.

847
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
The nexus are intertwining.

848
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Hey Adam, this is Tom from the Buckeye Drive Time Podcast.

849
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Since you have some audio comments,

850
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
you've played me a couple times on the air.

851
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I appreciate that.

852
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And I have sent you a ton of mail

853
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and have just begged until I can beg no more.

854
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Oh, dude.

855
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I ignore all that shit for a Podgeau contract.

856
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm coming up on 100 shows.

857
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm getting ready to record.

858
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

859
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
What is that?

860
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Begging for a Podgeau contract?

861
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Oh, no.

862
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Let me just put that piece again.

863
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm coming up on 100 shows.

864
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm getting ready to record show number 80.

865
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And have just begged until I can beg no more

866
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
for a Podgeau contract.

867
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm coming up on 100 shows.

868
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm getting ready to record show number 80.

869
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And it would be great to have this done before I hit my centennial.

870
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That will mean that I have spun over 3,000 songs

871
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
from the Podsafe music network

872
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and played over 3,000 promos for other podcasts.

873
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
One of the things that's kind of

874
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
concerning is how many of the podcasts that I have spun

875
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the first promo for on Buckeye Drive Time

876
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and they've going on to have Podgeau contracts.

877
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
What do I have to do here?

878
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Let me know.

879
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I definitely would like to see if being on Podgeau

880
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
can up the listenership.

881
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Thanks, talk to you later.

882
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Well, I should certainly hope so.

883
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Well, there's a couple of things we can do.

884
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The first of all, just I think I should reiterate

885
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
when we launch very soon.

886
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's going to be free for any podcast.

887
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Anyone who wants to do any type of podcast

888
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and you'll be able to use the infrastructure,

889
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
the network, the delivery network.

890
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We've got fantastic place for your audience members

891
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
to interact with you, interact with each other,

892
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
connect, share, a lot of the aisle, the stuff.

893
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It's a social media network.

894
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And you'll be able to use all that for free.

895
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Maybe you want to check that out first

896
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and see, because it's like, yeah,

897
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I just want to get the contract done real quick.

898
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It doesn't work that way.

899
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Everyone always has questions and it's a process.

900
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And the process is ongoing.

901
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Your name of course has been submitted

902
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
to the official submission committee

903
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
who his name is Richard.

904
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I did that probably a couple of weeks ago.

905
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Yeah, man.

906
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I like what you're doing.

907
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Definitely.

908
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Okay, I'm going to wind it up.

909
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I've got to head off to the office.

910
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Lots of stuff still to do.

911
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's going to be another fun day.

912
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Breaking some technology,

913
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
dreaming, coming up with cool stuff.

914
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And as always around the four or five PM,

915
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
we all break out our laptops and

916
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
speakers and start cranking up music

917
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
because we're all just so giddy and stupid by that time.

918
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The Adams is at Roberts,

919
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
from the looking out the window podcast

920
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and the Kansas City Weather Podcast.

921
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I was just wondering if you have gotten a chance

922
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
to hear more of a class brand new song.

923
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You just put it out on the podcast music network.

924
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
A few days ago,

925
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I don't know, maybe in the weeks ago.

926
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I heard C.C. Chapman talking about

927
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
he couldn't play it because of computer problems and stuff.

928
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's called not for me,

929
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
just absolutely made tender,

930
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
emotionally gripping,

931
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
you know,

932
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
it really showcases your voice.

933
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It's going to lead you crazy for more at the end.

934
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And I think you'll just be horrible.

935
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
If you didn't get a chance to at least hear it

936
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
or even play it on the B.S.C.

937
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Saturday, email,

938
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
we're going to be interviewing here

939
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
for looking out the window.

940
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You're probably this week.

941
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't know if it would be good

942
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
in this week's show or not,

943
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
but we'll get the story behind what that song is all about.

944
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm looking out the window.

945
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And you're listening,

946
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
there's that would be a very cool thing to hear.

947
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I want to be sure to be able to hook up

948
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and do the interview.

949
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And keep it going.

950
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm going to have you back in the stage, bro.

951
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Bye.

952
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Shouldn't life be easy now.

953
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Now I'm over you.

954
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But why do I care?

955
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And why can't I laugh?

956
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And why do I fall to pieces?

957
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Every time I see your photograph,

958
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
is it because

959
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
it's because

960
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
it's because

961
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
it's because

962
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
it's because

963
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
it's because

964
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
it's because

965
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
it's because

966
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
it's because

967
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
it's because

968
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
it's because

969
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
it's because

970
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
it's because

971
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
it's because

972
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
you're older because

973
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
you're younger.

974
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
you're older.

975
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
it's because

976
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
you're older.

977
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
it's because

978
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
you're older.

979
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You're older

980
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
you're older.

981
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
you're older.

982
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
you're older.

983
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Too high, but it hurts so much in sight

984
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And I know, I know, you're not for me

985
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I know, you're not for me

986
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I tried to tell you

987
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Time and time again

988
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But love is blind and you decided not to see

989
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What I told you, what I needed

990
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And I know, it's not for me

991
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But I can't be there

992
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So I tried to hide

993
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
But it hurts so much in sight

994
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And I know, I know, you're not for me

995
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I know, you're not for me

996
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Shouldn't life be easy now

997
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Now that I'm over you

998
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Wow, is that prettier?

999
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Laura Clap, not for me

1000
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I totally agree, it does leave you

1001
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Just wanting for more at the end of that

1002
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It is chilling

1003
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And you can find Laura Clap on the Podsake Music Network

1004
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You know, it's really nice

1005
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You know, all the Podsake Music

1006
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You can really get involved in an artist's career

1007
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
What they're doing

1008
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Because it's all still so small

1009
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I guess it's very much reminiscent of the 60s

1010
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And coffee houses and stuff like that

1011
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And the FM radio in the early early early days

1012
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And what's so nice is that

1013
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And so often when I play a song

1014
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
The artist will send me an email

1015
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Because when you report that into the network

1016
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Automatically notification is sent to the artist

1017
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And they'll send me an email

1018
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Thanking me

1019
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Oh, terrible

1020
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Excuse me

1021
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Damn, sorry

1022
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But they'll do it every single time

1023
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And my response is almost automatic now

1024
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Please don't thank me

1025
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I thank you so much for putting your music up there

1026
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
For taking a risk and hopefully it's paying off for every single artist who is

1027
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Joining up with PMN

1028
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And also when we come out with Podsco plus in the PDM

1029
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
There's all kinds of stuff for artists there as well

1030
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I mean it's like

1031
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I wish I had a hundred more people

1032
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So we'd go a hundred times faster

1033
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It's just it's so much work and so much to be done

1034
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But it's it's going to be great

1035
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
