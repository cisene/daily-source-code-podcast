1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 347.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey Craig, what's up?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I wonder what it would be like if Technorama was picked up by Pod Show.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hmm, I wonder.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Corporate accounts payable means speaking just a moment.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Corporate accounts payable means speaking just a moment.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And internet error occurred.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What the fuck does that mean?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't know Craig.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's Craig.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Not Craig.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Not Craig.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's Craig with a K.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's not that difficult.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, at least your name is in George Michael.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There is nothing wrong with that name.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There wasn't until that no talent asked clown started getting arrested everywhere.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Uh-oh, here comes Curry.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I need to get back to work.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I just know I had him curry's gonna make me come in on Saturday and do a podcast.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I'll do it because I'm a big was.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It sounds like somebody's got a curse for the more news.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You are not a worse and well, I too am not a worse.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello, Chuck Craig.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hi, it's Adam.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How's it going?

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Uh, did you guys get the memo about putting cover tags on your podcast?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, I got the memo right.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you could do that, that would be great.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, and I'm going to need you to do a podcast on Saturday.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That would be great.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Uh, that was a little weird.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, but you're still a woodman.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We don't need no sticky drinks, man.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Fantastic.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's Adam Curry.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello, Adam.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is the new love of your life, Laura Clav.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Come and do your life from Kansas City's Barnetasha.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wish you were here.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Switching.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey, the morning vanity.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come over half the sleep.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just sent a bad decision.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Come home.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Quick to anticipate.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Which part of our jeans?

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
While she puts the fake eyelashes on.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Every morning same reaction.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Have some room Saturday's fashion.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hey, hey, sister, you can let your head down.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You ain't done nothing bad and nothing up to feel so good.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She's under self attack.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Can't do this, can't do that.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Or she might lose her precious hands.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Watch your figure, watch your weight.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Clean out that empty blade.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Throw you know that ain't no way to live.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Time for social intervention.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Listen girl, pay close attention.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hey, hey, sister, you can let your head down.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You ain't done nothing bad and nothing up to feel so good.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You ain't done nothing bad and nothing up to feel so good.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're just the pilot of the world and the rush.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're this crazy life we live in is all a part of the world.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Or a clap.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, no, no.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey, hey sister, everybody.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How you doing?

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It is Monday.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Here at Curricanage, a beautiful day.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Blue skies.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No wind.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
About four or five degrees centigrade.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It is just fantastic.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And of course, I spent the weekend here at home.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It was really, really nice.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But if I had a choice and I wasn't at home,

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that doesn't mean I'd choose it over here.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If I wasn't San Francisco in the other home,

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think I would have been in Kansas City.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hey, Adam.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is at Roberts from the Kansas City weather podcast.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hey brother, I was driving home from the Matthew evil Laura Clapshow here in Kansas City on Friday night.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Actually turned on a daily source code right after that, which I was halfway through.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And heard the announcement about the show.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And the fact that you said if you were in the States, you would have come and mad.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Brother, you missed a show.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Holy smokes.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Now, because of his popularity, you probably would have thought that Matthew evil would have

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
gone ahead and closed out the show and Laura would have opened for him.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, I was not the case.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And, you know, Matthew evil isn't absolutely phenomenal guy and phenomenal artist.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But Laura, holy smokes, dude.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You have got to wonder why some big,

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
recording label hasn't picked her up.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, no.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's the quote of the night.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We're sitting at the table talking to Matthew evil.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
One of the girls were sitting with leans over and says, you know,

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
she would be a perfect open for Cheryl Crow.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Matthew evil turns around and says,

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No, she could close for Cheryl Crow.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I couldn't agree more.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Sorry, you couldn't be there, brother.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I know they're going to be doing some more stuff in Nashville.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So if you go to Kansas, go see him there.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And Laura is actually originally from Kansas City.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And Matthew evil sounded like he was all for coming back to town and playing at this place.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So if you get a chance when they're over here or over there, whatever,

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you got to check him out.

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In any case, have a great weekend at him and we'll talk to you later.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So that came, you know, like in the middle of the weekend.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I was like, I really wish I could have been there.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But it was nice being home.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let me make that very, very clear.

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, man.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was expecting some more pot-sake music videos to pop up,

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
particularly after that show.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's someone must have videotaped it.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I guess not.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Got a couple cool pictures.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And it looks like that was a great, great show.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Congratulations to Laura and to Matthew evil.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And yeah, what a nice guy, Matthew.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You need to say something like that.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
By the way, let me just say, I would really be sad

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
if a major record label picked her up.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I've been talking a couple of pot-sake music artists

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
over the past week or so.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know, some email conversations.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And, you know, many of them have been very, very close to being signed by a major.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You know, only to be dropped later on or the timing was wrong.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's like, it's crap.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can be putting out tons of stuff.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can put out a new song every single day if you want.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Every single day.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Another thing that doesn't quite work yet is being able to get your music into a purchasing situation,

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
such as, well, such as iTunes.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You know, it takes many weeks.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In some cases, many, many months.

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In fact, I think that's actually what this price-fixing thing is about.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You know, they're looking at price-fixing within the music business for online downloads.

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think that part of the issue here is that independent labels don't get the same courtesy

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that the three or four majors do in getting their stuff up in a timely fashion,

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
which I think still is either, you know, every Tuesday, I think is a possibility.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That makes sense.

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So once a week.

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But really, if you want to get up there, I think it takes at least six weeks if you're independent.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, along with the pot-sake music network.

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We're just waiting for our, was it sure mail?

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Subscription.

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Lots of people sent in comments about that, about the whitelist.

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Sorry.

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The blackberry.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I kind of remember to do that before the show.

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The whitelist, blacklist, stuff.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We'll be talking a bit about that later on today.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, regarding, uh, pot-sake music videos.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hmm.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, boy.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I keep following her show.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
She had it.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm talking about Calli.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Calli Lewis of Geek Brief TV.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
God damn it.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Calli Lewis of Geek Brief TV.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Our fearless leader.

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She had the sexiest t-shirt on and it was a Geek Brief six.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think or something like that.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I can't remember which one it was.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Now, can't be six.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Must be more than that.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Um, it was like nerds or hot or something like that.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was like, yeah.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, yeah, baby.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey, Adam.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Calli Lewis from Geek Brief TV.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hmm.

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So, I'm sitting here watching the Academy Awards.

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And all I can think about is your first video podcast.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Really?

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come here on the Jeff Smith video.

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So, so cute.

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It was adorable.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But you.

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're holding back on us.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I'm very upset at you.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're lips.

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hot.

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
sexy.

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But you have more to offer than that.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I'm not asking you for a glimpse behind the Terry Cloth.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I already googled that.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But just show us the whole face next time.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay.

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now, on to the next thing after my rant.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't worry about the production time.

227
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're busy, man.

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Send it to me and we'll take care of everything else for you.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay.

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ah, that's really sweet, Calli.

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's very, very sweet.

232
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You know, I chose specifically for that format.

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And I'm going to do another one this week.

234
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm just waiting for the right video to come along.

235
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Which is always the hardest thing.

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If I'm going to do this.

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Show of.

238
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Podsake music videos.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Then I want to make sure that I've got the, you know, got something that's good.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You know, it can't be just a song.

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
In fact, I was looking at a couple of music video channels over the weekend.

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And, you know, it really does make a difference.

243
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What the video, what's in the video.

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's a whole other piece of art, which doesn't necessarily have to come from the artists themselves.

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You know, so I think there's enough creative people that we're going to, I'm going to try and help connect.

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
To see if we can come up with some, you know, cool new ways to promote pod safe music and pod safe music artists.

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What else?

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, the reason why I chose that format of just the mouth is, you know, I started thinking,

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you know, I travel a lot.

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I can do my podcast basically from wherever I am, even if I'm on an airplane and I've done that several times.

251
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In the car, wherever, you know, it's pretty simple.

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Cast Blaster Travels now on the lightest notebook I've ever owned, the, the, the Shiba Porter J.

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In a pinch, I can just pop in the, the wireless mic and that's it.

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know, I'm good to go.

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But I don't always have the hair, you know, and this is, and we've talked about this.

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know, it gives me great confidence to have good hair, but I can do it.

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm very, I'm very, I'm very poor at getting my hair cropped.

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, it's almost a metro sexual moment.

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So I figured, you know, what is the one thing I can show at all times, which, you know, will be worth watching.

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And I figured, that's just about the only piece of me that can, you know, make pieces of me the counts.

261
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This podcasting thing, if you're listening to us on serious satellite stars, stars on the satellite.

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This podcasting thing is really happening.

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You know, who else has an iPod and is listening to podcasts, not just music.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
In fact, probably not even any music off the iTunes music store, but solely listening to podcasts.

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, yes, it's holiness.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The Pope.

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And here's Father Roderick.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Tell us all about it.

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Father Roderick here from the daily breakfast that daily breakfast.com.

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Remember, I went to Vatican Radio almost exactly a year ago to tell them about podcasting.

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, they immediately understood the importance of this new medium.

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And in two days time, they had started to podcast themselves.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, check this out.

275
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This weekend, the Pope himself has started to listen to podcasts.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When Pope Benedict XVI visited the headquarters of Vatican Radio last Friday for their 75th birthday,

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the people that work over there offered him an iPod Nano, preloaded with podcasts and music.

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The back was engraved through the words to his holiness Benedict XVI in Italian.

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Since Vatican Radio offers podcasts in eight different languages,

280
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the Pope now has the technological capability himself to plug in and listen to these podcasts.

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But what is the Pope has finished listening to the two gigabyte of audio on his iPod Nano?

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Since he's a pretty busy guy, he perhaps could use some suggestions about what to listen to next.

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So this week at the daily breakfast, I'm launching a contest.

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
In order to find the most original, most interesting,

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
funniest or most surprising top three of podcast or pot-save music for the Pope to listen to.

286
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The winner will receive a special gift from Vatican City.

287
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So visit dailyBrexas.com and mail me an audio clip with your favorite political top three

288
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
to dailyBrexas at sqpn.com.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's help Pope Benedict discover this great world of podcasts and pot-save music.

290
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes, you're holding this, this is podcasting.

291
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, Roder, great idea.

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And if anyone can get podcasts onto the Pope's iPod, you know what's going to be?

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Father Roderick, you know, he can do that.

294
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Dude, that would be so cool. There's lots of inspirational podcasts that we're qualified.

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's for sure.

296
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But, you know, if you really want to show the Pope what's going on, you've got to slip a little yeast radio on there.

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, man.

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I wonder if he would declare this podcasting, the devil's work or not.

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Ah, very cool.

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, that's nice.

301
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And he's definitely keeping up with the times.

302
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Our Pope.

303
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But of course, you know, what I'd really like is for him to go through the whole experience

304
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
of subscribing to podcasts through the iTunes Music Store

305
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and see if he can bless that somehow I doubt it.

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Lots of, actually, you know, today is going to be a mix of feedback

307
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
in audio form and email form.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Dave Christensen says, Adam, on Friday show you mentioned that you believe your case

309
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
against MTV was important and could have set precedent.

310
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I quickly took a break from studying to run a citation check on your case.

311
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It turns out that the MTV V curry case is referenced by a number of courts

312
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and all the opinions are positive, meaning that they do not overrule any points in the opinion written for your case.

313
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Specifically, MTV versus Curry mentioned 34 court opinions three of which discuss my case.

314
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Specifically, MTV versus Curry is mentioned inside it in 58 law review articles.

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, then Dave says these aren't huge numbers.

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But it isn't really bad considering its opinion from a district court case.

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's right, the pellet court case provides more presidential weights and therefore

318
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
are cited more often.

319
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
See, I told you, I told you that it was a precedent setting.

320
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I guess that's what you're trying to tell me.

321
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Michael Barry says, Adam, I think you're missing a big reason why the Iraq war

322
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
doesn't draw the same attention or protest as the Vietnam war.

323
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Now, I said that this is because the mainstream media has done something very different

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
than the Vietnam war where we saw actual news reels.

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And there were reels that was filmed, I think, at the time, mostly film.

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Of dead American boys, well, predominantly American boys, you know, being brought home

327
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and on the battlefield.

328
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And what Michael says is the real reason that there's not that much attention is the lack of a draft.

329
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A mix as I do not, Michael is making them.

330
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I do not support a draft, but if there ever was one, the shit would hit the fan.

331
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Self-interest is one of the biggest factors driving the protests against the Vietnam war.

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ooh, I don't know about that.

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm not old enough to know.

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But, oh, man, can you imagine a draft being instituted?

335
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, you're right.

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It definitely would stir up some majors.

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hey, I didn't want you here.

338
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Actually, you know, I hope you win your court case and everything goes well for you.

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I know that there's such that if they don't understand the meaning of the English word, public,

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
then they shouldn't be using an English website now, should they?

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah, right.

342
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
For example, the public part, just because it's called public.

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It doesn't mean I'm allowed to go there and pick flowers or follicles again.

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't think they're going to like the stand-on in court.

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And I think you'll do just fine, I always do.

346
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So just this said, all folks says on the internet.

347
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Just the adventures.com's going to have to read some of my French three dollars.

348
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So, bye for now, and may the win be with you.

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So, that's right, Roger.

350
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Just because the park says it's a public park does not mean you're allowed to pick flowers.

351
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There are follicles around, like goodness.

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So Roger and I are definitely going to try and meet.

353
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But it's not going to be at the Guardian Conference.

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There's something about, you know, a little confused about all the different words.

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You know, whereas when I talk about a lawyer here in the UK,

356
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
that's known as a solicitor.

357
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And he has some other word, which to me sounded a lot like parole.

358
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm not going to share what that was, off the look of the email.

359
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So that was not a day that he was free to travel.

360
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But we are definitely working on the hookup.

361
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Lots of controversy on the curry.com message boards.

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Comic strip blogger is all over the place.

363
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And he keeps saying kind of the same things.

364
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And, you know, I asked him if he would just do me a favor

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and participate in the show and not just ramble on the comments

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and really give me something that I can work for.

367
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Comic strip.

368
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So it is time.

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
To hear.

370
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Comic strip.

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
From our favorite poster.

372
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Comic strip.

373
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Jeff, you're not to come.

374
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Comic strip.

375
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay, here we come.

376
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This comic strip blogger.

377
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I just wanted to comment about all this stupid lawsuit

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
against the poor Dutch journalist.

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So Adam Curry.

380
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Stop kidding us.

381
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You started this whole fucking lawsuit against the Dutch employee

382
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
just to get publicity for yourself.

383
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I am sorry, but I am not digging this whole

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
defending my family, my copyrighted photos, staff.

385
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Which people like you, with middle life crisis,

386
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
have such late life hobbies where they pretend

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to fight good causes, but in your reality.

388
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It is just subconscious need from a publicity.

389
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And why the fuck you care at all about

390
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Netherlands and about what Dutch press rights.

391
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Do you have Dutch citizenship?

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
For fuck's sake.

393
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I ask you this stuff for many, many times.

394
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Many times it didn't answer.

395
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So, fuck you.

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's sort of a disclaimer that the comic strip blogger

397
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
is in no way family's safe.

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You know, I actually worked on a whole ran to whole

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
replied to comic strip blogger.

400
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
With Christine, a listener who said,

401
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
let me help you work on some long ass rants.

402
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And we came up with something that was pretty good,

403
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but I'm actually going to go hold that back if you don't mind.

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Because this Thursday is when the judge will

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
give the verdict and tell us all what the decision is.

406
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And that will really answer a lot of your questions there

407
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
or a comic strip blogger.

408
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And of course, I do care.

409
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You know, if you look at the Netherlands,

410
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
look at their track record for wealthy people

411
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
who have been killed famous or wealthy people

412
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
in the last five years, several of whom I know

413
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and have known personally.

414
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So, the protection of my child goes above all.

415
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And then, secondarily, in this comes back to the MTV vs. Curry suit,

416
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I believe that this is important for creative commons.

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And when a mainstream publication says that the value

418
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
of something on the internet is nihil as in zero

419
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
because it's out there and it's published.

420
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You know, I think that that's a travesty

421
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
if they would get away with that.

422
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And it basically breaks creative commons.

423
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And so, all I want is some sort of precedent,

424
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
some sort of signal from the judge that will say this is not okay

425
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and we're not just going to let you pay someone off with a fee

426
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and go and do it again the next time.

427
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's really what that's what all it comes down to.

428
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So, any rants on that, I reserve until hopefully Thursday show,

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
hopefully I'll know before you guys get up in the US.

430
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Excuse me.

431
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh, my goodness.

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hold on, maybe I should play this.

433
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Hey, happy, what's up?

434
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, the world seemed to be better again.

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I know change is inevitable.

436
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And you know, I've tried hard to stay up with the times.

437
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I even call the Daily Source Code the Charlie.

438
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But Adam is up to his old tricks again.

439
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Just listen to Daily Source Code 342.

440
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Excuse me, since I'm drinking one right now.

441
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So good to be drinking one.

442
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The burp is back and things seem right in the world.

443
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And then this happened on Daily Source Code 344.

444
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Did you just burp?

445
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No.

446
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
On this show, you know what happens.

447
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What do you have to say?

448
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Did I burp?

449
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, what do you have to say?

450
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What do you have to say?

451
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Excuse me?

452
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
No.

453
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Since I owe.

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh, since I owe.

455
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thanks for listening.

456
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, for the past year and a half.

457
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh, I'm confused.

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Not even Patricia knows what to do.

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And I'm trying to figure things out.

460
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We may not even have birth, wanker, trinity, or even...

461
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I got to get that.

462
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Hey, Roger.

463
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah, Roger.

464
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You can find bedtime stories.

465
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
My kids love at www.psml.com.

466
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah, I know that comic-strik blogger is a pain.

467
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hey, Roger.

468
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Let me turn up the boom box so you can hear the cool mash-up.

469
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Happy pulled from the pod safe music network.

470
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

471
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What?

472
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

473
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

474
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What?

475
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

476
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

477
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What?

478
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

479
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What?

480
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

481
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What?

482
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What?

483
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What?

484
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

485
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

486
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What?

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What?

488
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

489
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What?

490
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What are you talking about?

491
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Lucky luck.

492
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Lucky luck.

493
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Lucky luck.

494
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Lucky luck.

495
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You're pointing out me is freaking me out.

496
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's go for his or on crack, man.

497
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
To wind that up a comic-strik blogger, I have the US nationality.

498
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I have a permanent work permit and if I wish to use it residency permit for the

499
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Netherlands have had that for many, many years.

500
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I work in the United States.

501
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I pay federal taxes in the United States.

502
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I pay local and council taxes here in the UK.

503
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah.

504
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Is there a problem with that?

505
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Actually, there is a problem.

506
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,600
It sounds to me like you're upset CSB that you don't have the opportunity to go to the United

507
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,000
States, which of course is a shame because it is rather difficult.

508
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But I have to say you might need a serious attitude adjustment if you want the US to let you in.

509
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But really, I'd like to delve into your history.

510
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I know lots of people that I shouldn't spend any time at all on a comic-strik blogger.

511
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But as you read around, I believe that comic-strik blogger is really Jacek Routowski.

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And you're a Nokia, a former Nokia employee who got fired and was so pissed off that you started to promote

513
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
very heavily and very aggressively the competition, which would be Microsoft.

514
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'd be really bummed out if I were listening to this story on serious stars because you're about to hit

515
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
a specific host Hellway East Radio, Donna Drew, Gilmore Daily, DVD Weekly and CC Chapman.

516
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Talk to you tomorrow.

517
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So we'll just continue here.

518
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Peter, thanks by the way for finally sending you a printable rundown and yelling at me.

519
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So now I know exactly what's going on serious.

520
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So if you're really that pissed off at Nokia, tell us about it.

521
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What happened?

522
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Why did you get fired?

523
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Give me some details on that.

524
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We could have a very interesting conversation.

525
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
The way you've carried on about MS mobiles and have put up your own money to, in fact,

526
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the comic-strik blogger was one of the first people advertising on podcasts by sponsoring

527
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
the Donna Drew Show even before they were at Pod Show.

528
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And I just want to know more about you.

529
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So please feel free to send in some more background on yourself, CSP.

530
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Hey, Adam.

531
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's Dan Schmidt from the Kidcast podcasting in the classroom show.

532
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And we are educational podcast that's focused on teachers and students and how to integrate

533
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
podcasting into an educational space, how to manage it, how to be creative about how

534
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
you integrated into the curriculum.

535
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We play lots of examples.

536
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Give lots of tips and we sponsor a contest.

537
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And this month's contest is pretty exciting.

538
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
What we're giving away an iPod shovel, a hundred dollar gift certificate to FTC publishing.

539
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And we're giving away five copies of my book, Kidcast podcasting in the classroom.

540
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So that's pretty cool.

541
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But here's the deal.

542
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We're focusing on podcast dramas.

543
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So if you think back to the goal-nage of radio and all the theater of sound and theater of the

544
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
mind stuff, it was really powerful stuff.

545
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And we want to use that medium for learning.

546
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So we're challenging teachers to, and students to create their own podcast dramas or

547
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
skids and share them with us.

548
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So they just need to write an original skit that contains at least two characters.

549
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And it needs to be educationally appropriate.

550
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And they should try to teach the listener something new, preferably in the curriculum within

551
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
their storyline.

552
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And we're looking for things that are short.

553
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Maybe three to four minutes.

554
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
They just have to record and edit their skit.

555
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Add some cool sound effects and maybe some music.

556
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And then put it up on their server as an MP3 and then just send us the link.

557
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Then they can find out more information by going to my website at Intelligenic.com slash

558
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
KidCast.

559
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Or they can find us in the iTunes podcast directory or in podcast alley.

560
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Just look for KidCast podcasting in the classroom.

561
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Thanks Adam.

562
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Stay creative and keep mom learning.

563
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The voting is now open on slam idle contest number nine.

564
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
The contestants are Cynthia French.

565
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I could kiss you in public.

566
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Like the fluency and the jacuzzi was removed.

567
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Like finding your favorite part of a really bad gift.

568
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
A Rachel can.

569
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Whether you are here as a queen or a whore.

570
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
When you think things can't get any worse.

571
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And it seems like you're coming apart at the seams.

572
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Just remember that you're the one who scheme these schemes.

573
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Patricia Evah.

574
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You know, as I do, we sing the same tune.

575
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Why couldn't I stay and share the mood?

576
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Seems Stuart.

577
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
As a cell for moon rises.

578
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Growing taller over.

579
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Over.

580
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The song and trees that have grown in the fields that.

581
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
G-S-Bast.

582
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And I paint you new cities where walls are clean with people are there.

583
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And welcome you in.

584
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
No, it's not like that.

585
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
But take one step.

586
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It can be.

587
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Maybe.

588
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And Andrew Taylor.

589
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Do you still feel shy around women?

590
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And don't know what to say.

591
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Do you get on nervous and clammy and just wish it would go away?

592
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
To cast your vote.

593
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000

594
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Hey Adam.

595
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Marcus Couch here.

596
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And I'm here to remind everyone of a few things.

597
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
First and foremost, the new episode of Pod Show Music Rewind is out.

598
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's episode 23.

599
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And you can find the show at podshowmusicrewind.com.

600
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Now this week we've got Pod Show Music Podcast, like the Rock and Roll geek indie cast,

601
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
accident, hash, mad pod, and the scenes scene.

602
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But in addition, we'll head over to the UK and check in with Evan Crawford and the reaching

603
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
for lucidity podcast.

604
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We'll get jacked with Jack Elias on the get jacked podcast from Washington D.C.

605
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We also check in with Rich Palmer and the Miami Valley music cast.

606
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And I'm excited to announce our first Japanese based podcast into Rewind.

607
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
What's happening in Tokyo hosted by Tokyo Dan?

608
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So what did all these music podcasts have to do to get on Pod Show Music Rewind?

609
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And ultimately be heard on serious stars?

610
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Well, it doesn't take special VIP status selling your soul or

611
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
mounds of cash.

612
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
All you have to do is edit a song.

613
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And then you click of your music podcast that features a song from the pod

614
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
safe music network.

615
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And then email that clip to me at podshowmusicrewind at gmail.com.

616
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's it.

617
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's really just that easy.

618
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Thanks everyone and be sure to check out the new episode at podshowmusicrewind.com.

619
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This is Marcus Couch.

620
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Take care everybody.

621
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
All right, everybody.

622
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I think a little monkey markers.

623
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's funny.

624
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
How people want to be on the serious satellite.

625
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But it is actually, see, when does it put on?

626
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's on Tuesdays between nine and 10 Eastern time is when the podshow music

627
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
rewind airs and its entirety and it's been opened up to, as you heard,

628
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
anyone who has a pod save music podcast wants to send, you know,

629
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
just caught up a little segment of it where you play a song.

630
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Send it off to Marcus.

631
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
He'll take care of you.

632
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister was on television.

633
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think it was Friday night, I believe.

634
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
On this talk show called Parkinson.

635
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Now Parkinson is, is really, it's not just a talk show.

636
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Parkinson or Pauki.

637
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
As you know, and here is an institution, really.

638
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But, you know, to have the Prime Minister come on and sit down and just chat

639
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and his, you know, Parkinson's format is, you know, himself, two chairs,

640
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and a backdrop and an audience.

641
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And that's it.

642
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It was really nice.

643
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It was, you know, he came across very personal, personal,

644
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and very personal as well.

645
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I didn't think he answered every question, you know,

646
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
to the best of his ability.

647
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But he did have a couple of really funny stories.

648
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And one that I like the most.

649
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He was talking about after his marriage to Shari Blair.

650
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And he hadn't really met, well, he had met his father-in-law,

651
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
her dad.

652
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Well, they hadn't really had any serious conversation.

653
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So after the wedding, everyone goes back to the house,

654
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and they're in the, I guess, the drawing room,

655
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
or the sitting room.

656
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And, you know, Tony's like, well,

657
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and I'm going to really have a chat with this guy.

658
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And he says, well, have a chat.

659
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And Tony says, sure.

660
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And he says, do you mind if I light a split first?

661
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Oh, I think he said joint.

662
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And then Tony went, yeah, okay, no problem.

663
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I was like, wow, that's pretty heavy.

664
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's much better than I didn't inhale stuff.

665
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It was just really nice.

666
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I wonder what would be like if George Bush would go on Oprah,

667
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
something like that.

668
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Well, maybe not Oprah.

669
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I guess, I didn't, didn't just recently do like a walk.

670
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean, I don't like the walking tour stuff.

671
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't like the edited stuff.

672
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Just do a sit down, don't edit conversation.

673
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You know, that would be, that would be good.

674
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Let people see who you are.

675
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You know, if there's anything wrong with this president

676
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
and there's a hell of a lot wrong.

677
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's this PR, man.

678
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Stupid.

679
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's just an idiot when it comes to PR.

680
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Does everything exactly their wrong way?

681
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Speaking of wanting to be on serious satellite.

682
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Hey, Adam, this is Tyler Jersey,

683
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Todd Show, great talk with you on Friday.

684
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You know, I was all psyched up when I saw on the show notes that

685
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
we're going to play my comment.

686
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I was just about to run out to best buy it to buy a serious satellite receiver

687
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
when I realized something.

688
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You see, there's developing case law here at the Delhi source code.

689
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Two wits, sir.

690
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The landmark holding in the recent case of quasi-toli

691
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
V. Curry stands for the proposition that a guest of the

692
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Delhi source code is not required to buy a satellite receiver

693
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
if their prom was played after the satellite window expires.

694
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This is exactly what happened to me.

695
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Of course, the remedy is for you to let me tell people

696
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to check out the Jersey Todd Show at www.jurzytodshow.com.

697
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There you go.

698
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
After they're done listening to the Chacha.

699
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So let's be a big man.

700
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Nice try.

701
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Or off the best buy.

702
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Ah, shoot dude.

703
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I missed it again.

704
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'll have to remember to do better next time.

706
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
All right.

707
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
In this portion of the source code,

708
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
we're going to be talking about a whole bunch of different things

709
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
that are definitely related to podcasting, internet,

710
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
freedom in general.

711
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You know, all the stuff that we want to keep off of the satellite.

712
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
One other thing that this conversation keeps going on.

713
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Thank you all very much for sending in so many different ideas about being

714
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
blacklisted at ISPs.

715
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
For those of you who are just tuning into the Charlie,

716
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
this is about large ISPs.

717
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And the biggest defender is Microsoft with Hotmail and MSN,

718
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
who will flag different types of email is spam.

719
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And the whole issue is you have to go to these intermediaries

720
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
to have it solve.

721
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You know, if you go as an individual or even as a company and go to Hotmail

722
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
or Microsoft and say, hey, can you take me off your blacklist

723
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
put me on the whitelist?

724
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
They basically say, you go talk to those guys.

725
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And those guys happen to charge money.

726
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So lots of comments come in about running my own mail servers.

727
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And there's a whole bunch of things that can be done.

728
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But I'm quite sure at the end of the day,

729
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
we've done some cost analysis.

730
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's much, much cheaper to have an intermediary do it.

731
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
At the same time, by the way, I have to say in that $80,000 fee,

732
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
there's also hardware that can really handle strong email by itself

733
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
has become such a science.

734
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You know, you have engineers who are dedicated specifically

735
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to fine tuning email delivery performance.

736
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Well, I guess the spam guy is really fine tune that stuff.

737
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But in general, I think it's just the bad thing.

738
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's part of this, we're seeing AT&T now saying that they want to charge

739
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
people who are providing content.

740
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So they kind of make money on both ends of the stick.

741
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And we'll talk about that in a bit.

742
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Also, lots of talk about the music industry.

743
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But first, this blacklist is...

744
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Hey Adam, it's Matt Snydgrass.

745
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And as you know, our company and your company

746
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
have been doing a lot of business lately.

747
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And the communications of which has been the email.

748
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But just last week, an email that I think came from Ron

749
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
to me that you and Greg and Chris were copied on.

750
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Got blocked in our company, spam filter through Lotus Notes,

751
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
which troubles me because we've since successfully been able

752
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
to email each other.

753
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But just this email got put in a possible blacklist section.

754
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So in a world that two businesses are trying to conduct business,

755
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
this blacklist problem could hurt business, literally.

756
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So I just wanted to let you know that that problem

757
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and throw that onto the fire as well.

758
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Take care, buddy.

759
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Thanks, Matt.

760
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
God, this is me off.

761
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
See, this is exactly what happens.

762
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You have a company.

763
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And then you start to say any emails.

764
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And Matt, of course, works for some offshore gambling company.

765
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Just kidding, dude.

766
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I don't know if you want me to mention who you work for.

767
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But I check that you guys have four email servers.

768
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And it's very possible that either one of them somehow automatically

769
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
flagged.

770
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
In fact, you have two email servers in San Francisco.

771
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So it could have been, which are third and fourth in the list.

772
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So the first, you have a main email server, which doesn't appear to be in San Francisco.

773
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'm sorry.

774
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I want to San Francisco.

775
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I want to San Jose.

776
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
There you go.

777
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Or at least I can make that up by the naming convention.

778
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So if the first two ones are busy, then it'll fall over to the third of the fourth one.

779
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And now the discouraging thing here is that it's very possible.

780
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And also highly likely that your notes installation,

781
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
check some kind of database somewhere periodically to see if there's any spam,

782
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
addresses that should be added to it.

783
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And it wouldn't surprise me if they got this from,

784
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
like the short mail people, you know?

785
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Or maybe someone else.

786
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't know.

787
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Gabrielle Lowe says,

788
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
if it's so hard to get email through hotmail without being white listed,

789
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
why do I receive five times as much spam in my hotmail inbox

790
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
than any other web mail system?

791
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Well Gabrielle, because this is not about spam.

792
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's being sold as an anti spam issue, but it's not.

793
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And in fact, what's happening is people, the companies that are sending you that spam,

794
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
in likelihood, may even be paying to have a delivered.

795
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You know, this is, AOL is not saying they're going to trap spam.

796
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
They're saying they're going to charge people for it.

797
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That's, that's a very, that's something very different.

798
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So, you know, you're only seen as legitimate if you can come with this huge

799
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
water of cash.

800
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
This is very bad.

801
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Believe me.

802
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
If you ever think of starting, you know, your own business on the internet.

803
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You're going to run into this problem and it really does suck.

804
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
There's also a clearing house.

805
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Someone, a couple of people sent me email about about a clearing house,

806
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
where you can basically have them deliver your email,

807
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but it's very hard then to have your, you know,

808
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
any identifying marks of your own company in there.

809
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It just sucks all wrong.

810
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's bad.

811
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's really bad for the internet.

812
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Let's talk about AOL for a second.

813
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Now, I mentioned that I haven't done it yet, a while back,

814
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
was it last week.

815
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I listened to this session, the artist's round table at podcast hotel.

816
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And I'm really sorry I wasn't there.

817
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And it was just impossible for me to make it.

818
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's coming to San Francisco.

819
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So I do plan on attending there because I think we have a lot

820
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
of confusing issues.

821
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And what I had suggested is I would comment on that session

822
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and re-record it.

823
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
But okay, you know, that would be like three hours long.

824
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So I just want to address some issues here.

825
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Because now, also after, you know, after having listened to it,

826
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
there were two people talking.

827
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
One was, I think Tim is his name.

828
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm not sure who was, who was the representative for Iota.

829
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And Iota, maybe I should take a look and see what they call themselves

830
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
exactly as far as I understand it.

831
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
They are an organization of independent record labels.

832
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Let me see.

833
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I owed, which would be dot com.

834
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I hope not dot org.

835
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I wouldn't make any sense.

836
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Well, that's Iota national international training and consultancy.

837
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So maybe it is dot org.

838
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's interesting.

839
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Welcome to Iota.

840
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
No, that's a shoot.

841
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I can't even find Iota.

842
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Let me just punch in Iota.

843
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Let me see what comes up and trust the old Google tracks and relevance

844
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
for me people.

845
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Iota on low.

846
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's the independent online distribution alliance.

847
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Ah, okay.

848
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Let me just read with their charter is so I don't miss quote anything.

849
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Iota alliance dot com.

850
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
There you go.

851
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Iota is the industry leading digital distribution company for the global independent

852
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
music community run by an experienced team of digital music experts with a passion for independent music.

853
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Iota distributes thousands of releases from independent labels to digital music outlets around the world.

854
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay.

855
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Now, they are a service essentially.

856
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So they sell their service to I presume to independent record companies not directly to artists.

857
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll just look into the clients tab here.

858
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Let me see.

859
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Find labels.

860
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, they do artists as well.

861
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Okay.

862
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So they've got.

863
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, they've got tons of them tons of them.

864
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
All right.

865
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So as I was listening, I kept hearing the guy from myota say things.

866
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You know, like, oh, it's the same podcasting is the same old thing.

867
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It's promotion from music.

868
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I was a woman.

869
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I think Jennifer was a name who was both a podcaster and a musician.

870
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And she really wanted payment from podcasters if they make money.

871
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And if they use music in their podcast.

872
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Now, this, of course, is not what the podcast music network does.

873
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And I'll just explain that briefly because most of you probably understand.

874
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The podcast music network is a very small and very simple license, which basically says

875
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
any tracks and artists makes available here on the podcast music network can be used by podcasters under the following conditions.

876
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Well, there's actually a couple of conditions there that have to do with collective works, etc.

877
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And so there are limitations to what you can do with it commercially.

878
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But you can pretty much, you know, just use it on your podcast as long as you attribute it.

879
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I put a link in your show notes and report it back to the network.

880
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That's really the biggest piece.

881
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And we're doing our best to automate that part, actually.

882
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And that's pretty much it. And this is part of our unlabel concept.

883
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And the unlabel concept really means that every independent artist is their own company.

884
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Is their own record label.

885
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And it's, you know, the record labels essentially have been disintermediated out of the equation.

886
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You don't need tons of money to record something.

887
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You don't need tons of money to create a video.

888
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And you can market very well online, particularly working with podcasters.

889
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And, you know, here, here am I, here am I.

890
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm a old DJ, ex-Broadcaster, my partner, Ron Bloom, together we conceive the pod save music network.

891
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He's a musician of blues guitars from Atlanta.

892
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So, you know, it kind of worked out.

893
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And we had some real discussion about this, you know, about how to make money.

894
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And there was also something else interesting that came up in the artist's roundtable.

895
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You almost unanimously, what I heard was, you know, don't give anything to the performing rights organizations.

896
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That money doesn't get to us anyway.

897
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Oh boy, I just have to say very briefly.

898
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Oh shit, I'll say that for tomorrow.

899
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So, so all of that didn't quite sit well with me.

900
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And that's why I really wish I had been there.

901
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And that actually asked me to send off a, you know, a quote or something in audio.

902
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And I'm glad I didn't do that because it would have been completely out of context for the conversation.

903
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But over the weekend, maybe it was Friday.

904
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
A news release came out.

905
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I think I saw it on podcast or new, no podcastingnews.com.

906
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And now everything has started to fall into place.

907
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And now I'm starting to understand what I owe to is trying to do.

908
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So, I'll just read this release to you.

909
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Tower records to start free download service from music mashups within podcasts.

910
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Actually, the story comes via a tector.

911
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Talk about reinventing tower records, which is in the throes of offline troubles.

912
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's trying to do something new online.

913
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It plans to open a new online service this summer called Tower pod.

914
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
God.

915
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That lets consumers create their own podcasts using a catalog of some 6,000 songs, which tower will provide free.

916
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
None of the major labels want to be part of this, mainly because of copyright concerns.

917
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But Tower has signed up independent online distribution alliance and indie music trade group and distributor.

918
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It's in the IODA, acts in the IODA, include hip hop group, black allicious, and rock flashback Peter Frampton.

919
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Tower intends to generate revenue from the podcast by selling ads on the most popular ones.

920
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Any money generated will be split up amongst a large group that includes the user who created the podcast, the artist, the label, and the publishers who created or own the music as well as tower itself.

921
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So now I get it. Now I understand why that conversation was driving the way it was.

922
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:09,000
The thought here is to make a pool of music available where I presume podcasters will be able to go to.

923
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,000
They say consumers, I guess maybe they're going to allow consumers to create playlists of stuff or something like that.

924
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But let's just take, let's just assume that any podcaster can go in there and use that music.

925
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And then I don't know if there's, you know, what the real terms of the license are.

926
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So sometimes there's, I've heard different things like, well, maybe you have to talk over the intro.

927
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We're basically all the stuff we went through radio.

928
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But they're going to be selling ads.

929
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And then that's the way that the money is going to be, I presume they're also going to be selling tracks.

930
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I mean, that's probably why you have tower records involved for Tower pod.

931
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But I think there's a, there's a thought mistake here.

932
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
First of all, you're divving up the money amongst, was it five parties?

933
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That doesn't make a lot of sense.

934
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Particularly, and look, you guys probably know music better than I do.

935
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But when it comes to advertising on podcast, I think we have some experience.

936
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And I don't know how many podcasters are going to want to take a small portion.

937
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
At the end of the day, let's just fast forward five years.

938
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Let's say that prices for advertising on podcast have been set and recognized.

939
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You're still going to be chopping it up into more pieces with your proposal than any other one.

940
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So, you know, that feels to me like there's just too many hands in the pot there.

941
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And then, you know, and who determines what music can be sold there.

942
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And, you know, let's just say advertisers don't want, you know, some rock song with the word fuck in it.

943
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And does that mean that song is excluded?

944
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I think there's just too many questions that have to be addressed.

945
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And obviously, I wish them luck.

946
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
No doubt about that.

947
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I mean, we're not competing with any store or any store-type format.

948
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
The sales and the pod sake music network are there just, you know, as an almost, as a service.

949
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You know, if you want to, you don't have to.

950
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You don't have to be listed on PMN only.

951
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
If you want to sell, you don't have to make anything available.

952
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You can take stuff off, you know, it's very, very flexible.

953
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
But I'm keeping a close eye on this one.

954
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And I guess they'll be announcing that all the plans hopefully will be able to see some of the terms.

955
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But it just seems like, you know, just seems like that might be a tough nut to crack.

956
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And if anyone from Iota has any thoughts about it and would like to spin it back, please record a comment and let me know.

957
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm very, very curious.

958
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It was listening to hood hype, hood hype.com.

959
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Jay Mac over the weekend.

960
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And boy, that blew me away there with those guys who were talking.

961
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I can't forget who we had on.

962
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I think it's one of his guys from New York.

963
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And they were talking about payola in the music business and how it's still rampant.

964
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And there's some DJ.

965
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think at Hot 97 in New York City, who's been accused of accepting $1,500.

966
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You listen to the latest hood hype, the podcast to get all the details.

967
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But he was accused of taking $1,500 for playing a record.

968
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And I thought to myself, man, just look at what's happening on hip hop.

969
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And look how many stations are playing hip hop.

970
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And look how many video music channels are playing hip hop.

971
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And then look at the currency that hip hop deals with.

972
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You know, lots and lots of bling, lots and lots of cash.

973
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You know, it seems like the artist.

974
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And even if you listen to how artists and DJs, you know,

975
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
there's a lot of respect going on and everyone loves everybody.

976
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh, maybe because they're all on the take.

977
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You know, I've never been offered money ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

978
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
In fact, when I was on the radio, my boss Lex Harding would tell me,

979
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
he said, you know, if someone from the record industry ever wants to buy you a drink

980
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
or takes you out for dinner, you can go ahead and accept.

981
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
But you must buy them the next round or buy or pay for the dinner.

982
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And you can always submit the bill to me, which never happened

983
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
because I was never offered that interestingly enough.

984
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I think it happens probably with with the DJs or kind of like, you know,

985
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
the not the morning or afternoon drive, you know, it's probably somewhere in hours

986
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
that still still count for BDS, you know, for the tracking system.

987
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So it counts plays, maybe maybe the midday person or something like that.

988
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's going to be someone who's not a high profile, not a high profile person

989
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
on the station.

990
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
But apparently it's just, it's completely rampant.

991
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So, you know, the music business is really falling apart at the seams here.

992
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And now all this talk about, you know,

993
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
anti-competition that the pay, all the scandals,

994
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
spitsers doing a pretty interesting job.

995
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And we'll pay attention to him.

996
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Nick.

997
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Guitietta's, I think, one ear,

998
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
thought I had of ladies in the way in which the unlabel is forming in a very,

999
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
in a way very similar to that of political revolution.

1000
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Theoretically, the transition from a dictatorship to a demographic,

1001
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
democratic or Republic style of governance happens when one,

1002
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
the central government loses exclusive control of information,

1003
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
meaning the ability to control distribution and thus the ideas of the public.

1004
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Ooh, that's definitely up there.

1005
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And two, the middle class begins to emerge and turn against

1006
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
said central government.

1007
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Very astute there, Nick.

1008
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I think you're on to something.

1009
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Definitely do.

1010
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Uh, what the hell was this?

1011
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
This was an audio comment.

1012
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't remember why I wanted to play.

1013
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Sure, mech sense of second.

1014
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Hey, I'm, my name is Byron Barman.

1015
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I was just listening to the Charlie number 346,

1016
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and Stewart Devonport seems to have a problem with some missing files from the iTunes

1017
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
music store.

1018
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
All right.

1019
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
About a year ago, I also lost quite a few downloaded songs,

1020
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
but after a quick email to the iTunes music store.

1021
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Dude, you're freaking me out with a left-to-right thing.

1022
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The port, I was able to read download everything.

1023
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
No extra money, no extra hassle, no problems.

1024
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
All I have to say, to Stewart is try emailing tech support before you

1025
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
publish on somebody else's show.

1026
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Adam, thanks for the show.

1027
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I look forward to it every day.

1028
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I don't have my own show yet, but you can check out my website at www.busticated.net.

1029
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Also, be sure to check out my little brother's music on the pod save music network.

1030
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You can search for him under Andrew Bowerman.

1031
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Thanks a lot.

1032
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Thanks a lot.

1033
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
All right, okay.

1034
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Now, I just want to make sure you heard that because of opposing views.

1035
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Uh, I just have to wonder, I have a feeling that more people have been told

1036
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
sorry you're out of luck than not.

1037
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So, you know, I haven't been able to find any type of policy that says you can get your music back.

1038
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And of course, with the sales on the unlabel, you have a little cubby hole area

1039
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
through PMN where you can always go and read download your stuff,

1040
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
so you can play it wherever you are.

1041
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Let's see, just a couple things, yeah.

1042
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I wanted to mention this thing about, where is it now?

1043
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
About this congressman.

1044
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I think he's a congressman.

1045
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Let me just double check.

1046
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It's a good, uh, this is about that AT&T trying to own the net, uh,

1047
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Preston Garala posted this on, uh, I think on the curry.com comments.

1048
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
AT&T Verizon and other telcos have been warning that they're going to demand money from Google

1049
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
and other sites if those sites want adequate bandwidth.

1050
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
But now a senator is proposing that to ban the practice and is standing up to the telcos

1051
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
who are acting more like a cyber mafia than legitimate businesses.

1052
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ron Wyden of Oregon today introduced legislation that would

1053
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
ban network operators from charging sites for extra bandwidth.

1054
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
The law would also ban the practice of favoring some content providers over others.

1055
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I think that's more important, actually, that according to the New York Times.

1056
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Other congressmen are, uh, uh, co-tiling to the telcos because the telcos are big campaign contributors.

1057
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
They'd let the telcos do what they want and turn the internet into their own private network.

1058
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Okay, uh, the widen bill called the internet non-dense discrimination act of 2006.

1059
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Not a sexy name, but the Inda.

1060
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
The Inda, everybody.

1061
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
They, they, the faces tough sledding money talks and the telcos are doing a lot of talking.

1062
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Again, these are all comments from curry.com.

1063
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
In addition, the FCC has made it clear, they won't take any action on the matter,

1064
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
so we can look, we can't look to them for help.

1065
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So I say, um, could somebody please, you know, point out a link, you know,

1066
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
how do you, how do you support this bill? Is that by, uh, emailing your congressmen or, uh, or emailing, uh,

1067
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Ron Wyden, what, what is the, what is the, what is the correct action?

1068
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And maybe collectively, if we all, uh, hand over some money is,

1069
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
let's just, let's just fight money with funny, with funny with money.

1070
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Money with funny, baby, honey.

1071
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Let's just, uh, you know, collectively send a whole bunch of money to this guy, so we, you know,

1072
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and, and to other, uh, other people who support the bill, so they won't have to take money from the telcos.

1073
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And let, let your voices be heard. Let's see if, uh, this stuff actually works.

1074
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Now that we have voices, not just written voices, but real voices that can be heard.

1075
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Uh, thanks, uh, to everyone for all the vacation suggestions.

1076
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I guess you guys think I should take off, huh?

1077
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And I shouldn't podcast that all, I don't know if I can do that.

1078
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Uh, I definitely need, you know, internet wherever I am, just to keep up.

1079
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I had to empty out my Gmail inbox once in a while, so, you know, email doesn't start bouncing.

1080
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Um, but we're really going to go somewhere where virgin flies, and I think it's going to be either Antigua or Barbados.

1081
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So, uh, I'll, uh, let you know, but it is going to be the first week of April.

1082
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That's for sure, Patricia's birthday. It's going to be nice, Christina has vacation, very much looking forward to it.

1083
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Ken Wells has Adam your observation about stone people not getting arrested on cops was interesting.

1084
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I have noticed that the typical guy arrested on cops is not wearing a shirt.

1085
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
In fact, in my home, as soon as the police interact with the guy with no shirt, we all say, he's going to jail.

1086
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That is kind of interesting.

1087
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
No shirts. No shirt was definitely a way to get your ass lung in jail if you appear on cops.

1088
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
All right, um, that's it. There's nothing really.

1089
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I can save all this stuff for more, more pots and music network stuff.

1090
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
All right. Let's see. We did about 53 minutes, uh, overwhelmingly 99% of, uh, of all comments that came in said that, uh, you guys like the longer podcasts.

1091
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
So, uh, there you go. 54 minutes today.

1092
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Tomorrow, we'll be back, uh, it's going to be a week home at the cottage on Friday evening.

1093
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
We're going to go, uh, uh, on a little trip. I'll talk more about that later this week.

1094
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It's going to be the three of us. And, uh, oh, cheese. I can't believe I forgot the most important thing.

1095
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I wanted it. Well, not the most important. I forgot something really important today.

1096
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Shit. I want to do that at the beginning of the show. Well, this will show how many people listen to the whole thing.

1097
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:38,000
On Monday, um, the wind commander and I are flying back with a Delta Sierra, which has been completely refurbished, is completely ready, completely done and ready to rock.

1098
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And this will be its final fairy flight, which means it's going to be, uh, stationed at Ferrox Echo Golf Tango Fox Trot here, uh, in the UK, not far from the house.

1099
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And, um, I'm going to need a safety pilot while the plane is here. And a safety pilot is someone who's an experienced pilot, um, who flies with you.

1100
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Um, you know, sometimes we'll take over part of the duties, but it's just kind of theirs and extra set of hands ears and predominantly eyes.

1101
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
While I build up my, uh, my hours in, uh, you know, really someone who also knows the landscape knows the airways, everything.

1102
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And it just has some local knowledge of where I'll be doing most of my flying.

1103
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Um, so I'm looking for a safety pilot. And I thought, you know, there's so many people who are wishing me tailwinds has gone to be someone who knows somebody,

1104
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:37,000
or maybe someone who's actually listening to this podcast directly, who, um, has the time available and, uh, obviously you're going to be a pilot.

1105
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I, you're going to have, uh, experience, um, it will be great if you had experience in the Cessna 182 RG, um, but it is, you know, complex aircraft.

1106
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It'll be great if you're a flight instructor and it'll be great if you have no job and are retired and just want to fly a lot and make some extra money on the side.

1107
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Uh, so, uh, send off, uh, and, you know, any contacts or anything, uh, or anybody you would know to animecurry.com.

1108
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Uh, and I, you know, I'd love to start on Monday if you're available.

1109
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So, uh, Monday or we could possibly make a Tuesday, but there's gotta be some pilot around here who was just, you know, just loves to fly.

1110
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And, uh, and has the time, you know, I'm pretty flexible. There'll be some overnight stays.

1111
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Basically, we would take everything, we'd pay some money, um, and, uh, and we'd have some fun as well. So, looking for the safety pilot.

1112
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Pass it on, everybody.

1113
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Goodbye, everybody. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1114
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Another pod show pod guest. Stick it in your ear.
