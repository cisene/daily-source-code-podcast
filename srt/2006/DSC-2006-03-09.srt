It's the fair thing to do.

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's the fair thing to do.

It's the fair thing to do.

It's the fair thing to do.

It's the fair thing to do.

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's the fair thing to do.

191
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's the fair thing to do.

192
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's the fair thing to do.

193
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's the fair thing to do.

194
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's the fair thing to do.

It's the fair thing to do.

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's the fair thing to do.

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's the fair thing to do.

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's the fair thing to do.

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's the fair thing to do.

207
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's the fair thing to do.

208
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's the fair thing to do.

209
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's the fair thing to do.

210
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's the fair thing to do.

211
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's the fair thing to do.

212
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's the fair thing to do.

213
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's the fair thing to do.

214
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's the fair thing to do.

215
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's the fair thing to do.

216
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's the fair thing to do.

217
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's the fair thing to do.

218
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's the fair thing to do.

219
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's the fair thing to do.

220
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's the fair thing to do.

221
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's the fair thing to do.

222
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Perfect.

223
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,000
Is.

224
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:18,000
...

225
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And then then only then will I know and I had to hit the satellite window so I really had to get going on the show.

226
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
For those of you who are listening to this on serious satellite and stars, it's the stars cast everybody.

227
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is the daily source code is just the start of our four hour block of time that we've got here.

228
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We're all not some awesome podcasts after this show.

229
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You will hear Pacific Coast, Hellway.

230
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
After that Madge Weinstein with East Radio, Dawn and Drew.

231
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Steve Gilmore checks and I think he's at the E-Tech Conference with the Gilmore Daily.

232
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then digital flotsome, I believe a new episode today as a PW has been threatening.

233
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And we wind up between, was at 930 in 10 o'clock Eastern Time tonight with Michael Butler with a rock and roll geek show.

234
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't know if it's the indie cast or probably the straight up rock and roll geek show.

235
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So you can stay tuned for all of that.

236
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Gosh, man, it's so weird, you know, just not having people are calling the whole day.

237
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Have you heard anything? Have you heard anything? I haven't heard anything.

238
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't know. I don't know what to say.

239
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But this morning, I woke up and it was the first thing on my mind to have to say.

240
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So, hey, some, some other, oh, it's okay. So here's the real bummer news.

241
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The real bummer news about today's show.

242
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No audio feedback from comic strip blogger.

243
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Damn, that bums me.

244
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I wish I wish.

245
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He says he's not going to send me any for a while. That's a bummer, man.

246
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I love you. People are finally getting into your CSB seriously.

247
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
People want to hear your opinion in that, in that different voice that you have and your accent.

248
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And there's, in general, most people like it.

249
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And then another bummer, I just follow bummers today.

250
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The vacation isn't parallel, my friends.

251
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So there's a half-term vacation period, which really we didn't know about.

252
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is the first full year that Christina's in school because we, actually, I guess we did know it last year.

253
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But I don't know, maybe we, who knows what happened.

254
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Last year was so close to us moving in that we didn't really pay attention to it.

255
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But it seems like all of Europe has hit the lottery and is traveling to every destination,

256
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Virgin Airlines flies.

257
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can't buy a ticket, not even to New York, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles,

258
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Barbados, Antigua, Dubai.

259
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I mean, God, we've been there and didn't like it very much.

260
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But we just want some sun.

261
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Forget about it.

262
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And then hotel rooms.

263
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, sure, Mr. Curry, we found something in Antigua.

264
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The only availability left for two hotel rooms.

265
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Only $5,000 a night.

266
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And of course, I said, does that include a brojo?

267
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Jesus Christ.

268
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So that sucks.

269
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So now we're kind of looking at what we can do in Europe.

270
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Maybe Portugal, maybe, see what else is there.

271
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Portugal is probably the best bet we have.

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But still, it's very, very difficult just to find a place to stay at all.

273
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I said, how is this possible?

274
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And so first of all, I guess this is the British.

275
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The UK has their half-term all at the same time.

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
In other countries, by the way, they kind of stagger that, which is interesting.

277
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So all of the UK is just flying out.

278
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
They're just leaving the island like a mass exodus.

279
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So that's one problem.

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But the hotels.

281
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Now, this is very interesting.

282
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So this is what the prices are now for two hotel rooms.

283
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
$5,000 a night.

284
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And that's just regular.

285
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's not a suite.

286
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's just two hotel rooms.

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There are hotel rooms that are going for about $17 or $18,000 a night.

288
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And they're fully booked.

289
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And so I started online, of course.

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And I got so frustrated.

291
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I called Carl.

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I told you my girl who fixed everything for me and has done many vacations for us.

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And she says, well, what's happened is you have mainly Russians.

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
She said, there's just so many incredibly rich people coming out of the East block.

295
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And of course, you have to wonder how they became rich.

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And they don't give a shit.

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They're just buying up everything, taking their whole family.

298
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So it's really, it's a capacity problem if you can believe it.

299
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Just unbelievable to me.

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So don't know what we're going to do.

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think Patricia, the world record company boss.

302
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't want to say he's old, but he's a, he's a X record.

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Well, I guess still currently.

304
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
She's never really signed with any other record company.

305
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If you don't from co to he owns some hotels in Portugal.

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And she's going to give him a call and see if he can fix anything out.

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Because I can get a flight arranged down there.

308
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We can work that out.

309
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And even if we, if we had to go, economy class is not all that far.

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So it's not such a big deal.

311
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I think I could probably get an aircraft worked out for us to take down and back up again.

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now some good news.

313
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Although it doesn't work here in the UK yet.

314
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Ryan sent me an email.

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There is now a Google chat or Google.

316
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What do they call it?

317
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Is it, let me just see how to take my blackberry out of my pocket.

318
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Actually, it's Google talk, but it's the same thing as a Google chat.

319
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There's an application for the blackberry.

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So that you can actually maintain your, your Google chats on your blackberry.

321
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm very excited about it.

322
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Unfortunately, it doesn't work on non-US networks.

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's to be either a US or a Canadian network.

324
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I'll have to try that next week when I'm in San Francisco.

325
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Looks like I'm going out on Tuesday.

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And we'll be there for, let's see, a good work week.

327
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So about 10 days, that'll be out on the west coast.

328
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And we've, of course, we've got lots of cool things planned.

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Cali's coming out.

330
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Cali's coming out to Cali.

331
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We're going to do something together.

332
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, I was just listening to the penis episode 349.

333
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, excuse me, I mean the Charlie episode 349.

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I just want to have one comment.

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
As far as I'm concerned, you could call it what my mother called my penis,

336
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
which was the jingle bell.

337
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is Mike signing off from Oakland, California.

338
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hey, parents, please tell your kids what it's called, okay?

339
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is ridiculous.

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is really stupid.

341
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What's wrong with the actual words, huh?

342
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The actual name of the pieces of the anatomy, penis, vagina, breasts, nipple.

343
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, in other words, you can hardly say on television in the US.

344
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yesterday, one of my ego filters trapped a posting from a reporter

345
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
from the OC, the Orange County Register, who had heard rumors that I would be

346
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
showing up at the meetup last night.

347
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The Orange County podcast is meetup.

348
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And, yeah, I was like, whoa, so I posted a comment on the web

349
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
log and said, hey, I don't know where you're getting the information

350
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
from, but I'm in the UK, and I'm definitely not showing up.

351
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And it was very confusing.

352
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And finally, we boil it all down, we figured it out,

353
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
how the information stream got mangled onto the web,

354
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and I got some feedback about it today.

355
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hey, Adam, Corey, scriptener here from the buddy group

356
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and the Orange County podcasters meetup group.

357
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And just wanted to say thank you for being understanding, patient,

358
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and responding to the Orange County Register reporter

359
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
that contacted you regarding the claims they made

360
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
that you were coming here, even though you're in the UK,

361
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
to the United States meeting.

362
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's, we learned a valuable lesson tonight.

363
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What we learned was that no matter what you say about

364
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Pod Show, and then a lot of other things that you talk about

365
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that are great that are happening in the world,

366
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the only thing they hear is Pod Show.

367
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Adam, Corey, big hair, blonde, flowing locks.

368
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So anyhow, thanks for being cool.

369
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And of course, you're always welcome at the Orange County podcasters

370
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
meetup group if you're ever in the area.

371
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Make sure you bring Mark, your Shemotor Nemkov down to

372
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
because he's a cool dude, and we'd like to see him here.

373
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's a dead man.

374
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Keep up the good work.

375
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We'll talk to you later.

376
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He's a dick.

377
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I got to bring Mark, your Shemotor Nemkov.

378
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He's a guy who's trying to set up Pod Show LA.

379
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He's got like some, you know, he has some cockamamey plan

380
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
about setting up some kind of production thing

381
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
in Los Angeles.

382
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He's got a shack on Venice Beach and, you know,

383
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
in a laptop.

384
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And he's playing Mr. Big Shot.

385
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He's got a three series BMW.

386
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But no problem buddy about the rumor mill.

387
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's alright.

388
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm happy to help.

389
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I just didn't want people to think I was a dick

390
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
for not showing up.

391
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's all.

392
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And believe me, that happens a lot.

393
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Aloha.

394
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Aloha.

395
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If you remember, I left you a comment.

396
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
First comment.

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Show it in fact.

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
On episode 348 of the Charlie.

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And after my friends hearing it,

400
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
they were a bit surprised.

401
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And some of them, one of them,

402
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
instead of congratulating me on, you know,

403
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
going forward and being individual,

404
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
one of the rest of it independent.

405
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I could say was, I can't believe you said

406
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that's hard at the end.

407
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Which was a bit deflating.

408
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I thought, what can you do?

409
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Anyway, the news story.

410
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I submitted it on Newsvine.

411
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And it's also mean first of us on another day

412
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and delicious.

413
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And it's nice and healthy.

414
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So, it's great.

415
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Timberd.org is great.

416
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And also, I suggest everyone goes on

417
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
www.tibberd.org.

418
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And, you know, come on.

419
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Get to the point dude.

420
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Which is that there's a link.

421
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay.

422
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
To the point.

423
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Anyway.

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I wasn't actually going to be talking about my post.

425
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was going to be talking about them.

426
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
A guy a few comments after mine.

427
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Talked about something about being superior.

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And, you know, knowing how to podcast,

429
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
because he's a podcaster.

430
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And, as a regular listen,

431
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
also to Twitter, this week in tech,

432
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm Leo Leport,

433
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
also said a few tweets back.

434
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That podcast,

435
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and podcast listeners.

436
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There's always a one-to-one ratio.

437
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And, you, as the pod father,

438
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I could understand why you're a bit confused about that.

439
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why is it the mainstream,

440
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
or maybe the Wikipedia show?

441
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why is it the mainstream audience listening to podcasts?

442
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, before you go on,

443
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
let me say, have you looked at iTunes recently?

444
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Have you seen what's being promoted?

445
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Have you looked at Yahoo?

446
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Seeing what's being promoted?

447
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Please.

448
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's pretty obvious.

449
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You know, we're being shoved down.

450
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But this has been happening for a long, long time.

451
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So, that's one of the reasons.

452
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You see,

453
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I, as someone who likes to introduce people

454
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to new things, such as video gaming,

455
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and, you know, blogging,

456
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and read all web 2.0 services,

457
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
like flicker, and rapper,

458
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and or blogger, and so on and so forth.

459
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I like to introduce people to podcasts,

460
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
as well.

461
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What I found is that podcasting

462
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
is kind of like a evolution from blogging.

463
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Therefore, for people for some people

464
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to be able to understand what podcasting is,

465
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
they need to be able to understand what blogging is.

466
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I find that I need to explain to them

467
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
what blogging is before I can explain

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
to them what podcasting is.

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And this is generally a problem.

470
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And so, as you can probably see,

471
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that's why,

472
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
because of all the RSS fees and XML fees,

473
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
that there's usually one to one ratio

474
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
of podcasts and podcasts.

475
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This is, obviously, very simple,

476
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
but, to the mainstream audience,

477
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
it just looks too difficult to be able to access.

478
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And that's why I'm about to say,

479
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and by the time you've played this,

480
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you probably know what results

481
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
to your core case.

482
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And that's what I have of course.

483
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What results your core case is,

484
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and hope is a good one.

485
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, yes, one more thing.

486
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I was just thinking,

487
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
because podcasts are so addictive,

488
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and so great.

489
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I was just thinking that,

490
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
maybe once people listen to podcasts,

491
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I know for myself,

492
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
this definitely is my case.

493
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
In my case.

494
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, it's a lifting list in two podcasts.

495
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They'll start podcasting themselves,

496
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
which is why there is a one to one ratio.

497
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But anyway, it is very complicated,

498
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
especially for people that are slightly less literate

499
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
in a computer-wise.

500
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So that's why I have to say,

501
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
add a goodbye.

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Not to tell this side, but goodbye.

503
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay, not to talk.

504
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
All right.

505
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
To the people, chap.

506
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay.

507
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't think it's a one to one ratio.

508
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That makes no sense.

509
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There's plenty of reports that say,

510
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
there's millions of listeners,

511
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and we have our own reports.

512
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think that there's definitely

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
between 10 and 15 million listeners out there,

514
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
a worldwide mind,

515
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
which is a very, very small percentage.

516
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So two things I think that you're doing the right thing,

517
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
if you're enjoying it,

518
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
then you want to turn other people on to it.

519
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The easiest way is probably just send them a link and say,

520
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
click on the frickin' link and listen.

521
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Now, what you send them is of great importance.

522
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This is another thing.

523
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You know, people,

524
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
this is the sending thing that happened with weblogs.

525
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Now, weblogs for years were seen as,

526
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
oh, well, that's just someone writing about their cats

527
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
or sitting in their pajamas, kids.

528
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You've heard all the bullshit about it.

529
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So it'll take a while.

530
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It may even take as much as four more years.

531
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Maybe three years.

532
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've been out for almost two years,

533
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
so I always go in five of your cycles.

534
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So it could easily take three more years

535
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
before it really, really is widely known what podcasts are.

536
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So I definitely want to put some of the burden

537
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
on the promotional activities there on the listeners.

538
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And when you get your pod show plus,

539
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
it'll be much easier.

540
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Much easier to just enjoy pod casting.

541
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Whether you want to subscribe or not,

542
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and we make that very easy as well.

543
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So look for that to come out.

544
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I think yesterday,

545
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
they showed up just about everything.

546
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I've been following along.

547
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm now running everything on the podcast delivery network.

548
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I'm subscribed through everything on my pod show plus.

549
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And there's a pretty cool player.

550
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's really nice.

551
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So you can, you can,

552
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
you can compile your own playlist of your favorite podcast.

553
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So let's just call those a subscription.

554
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But in the player, you pop open the player.

555
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And it's, it's its own window.

556
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And you can select.

557
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can really do drill down and move back and forth

558
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
between what you're subscribed to.

559
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So you can say, alright,

560
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I have a list of stuff that I,

561
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that I want to listen to in the morning.

562
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If there's new podcasts,

563
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I pop up the player,

564
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
select the playlist that I want to hear.

565
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Immediately it shows you all the new episodes.

566
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Audio, video, AVI,

567
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Windows, media,

568
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
doesn't matter what it is at all plays.

569
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's very cool.

570
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I think that will probably make a big difference.

571
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Also, it does show notes.

572
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And oh, this is very cool.

573
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It does enhance podcasts.

574
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So it understands how to play those and give you the pictures

575
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and the links that are associated with it.

576
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So yeah, you're going to look out.

577
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They're coming very, very soon.

578
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Lots of people sent me the link to spamcube.com.

579
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Talking about yesterday's,

580
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
or the ongoing talk about the email tax.

581
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That AOL amongst others are threatening,

582
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
or I guess they're already planning to put into place.

583
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And I said, wouldn't it be great if you had a device

584
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
that you just jacked into your modem

585
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and it kind of took care of everything?

586
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So spamcube.com, there you go.

587
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The world's first anti-spam gadget for your home.

588
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
All you do is, let me see,

589
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
let me see if they have the tell you how it does it.

590
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, say hi to spamcube.

591
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Just plug this plug in this powerful little tool

592
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and you'll completely protect up to four computers

593
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
in your home from spam.

594
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Typical marketing.

595
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Makes no sense to technical people.

596
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Our proprietary built-in anti-spam technology

597
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
stops spam, so there's no subscription fee

598
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and it's easy to install.

599
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Also works with all operating systems

600
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and virtually every email program.

601
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So I guess what these guys do is they have a service

602
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
where your email, you'll see your DSL was down.

603
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And this is how email was meant to work by the way.

604
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's say your server at home is down.

605
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You won't lose your email.

606
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It'll just be stored on their service.

607
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And when your connection comes back up,

608
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
the email will be delivered.

609
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And you just get it from your spamcube.

610
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And you can then determine what is spam and what is not spam.

611
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But of course, they can communicate with all the list, et cetera.

612
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But it really gives you a lot more control.

613
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Does it say, what is it cost?

614
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
150 bucks, man.

615
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It should be offering some sex favors for 150 bucks.

616
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But the idea is right.

617
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We're getting very close to some consumer-based solutions on that.

618
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hi Adam.

619
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is Christian from Sweden,

620
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
without the podcast as yet.

621
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I just think that one way to solve this thing

622
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
with registration mail getting lost

623
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
would be to require people to do things

624
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
the other way around.

625
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Instead of sending registration messages to people,

626
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
you would have an email

627
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
that they send to you and have things on your mail service

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that have those emails trigger their registration.

629
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Thank you and goodbye.

630
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Right.

631
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes.

632
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I appreciate the thought, but that of course is not going to work.

633
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The whole point of using email is really for a confirmation

634
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that you are the person who you say you are,

635
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
or at least you are the email address

636
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
who says they are the email address.

637
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's so easy to spoof things the other way around.

638
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Basically, I could go register you,

639
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I could look up the code,

640
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and then I would email the code coming from someone else's email address.

641
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's pretty simple to spoof,

642
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and then you still have to build all kinds of stuff

643
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
on the other end to stop the spoofing.

644
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's not that trivial.

645
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's just, and people are really misunderstanding

646
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
that this is about spam.

647
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's not about spam.

648
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's about guaranteeing delivery of messages

649
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
to you from outsiders,

650
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
whether you want it or not.

651
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Now, of course,

652
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I would presume that with the AOL email tax,

653
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
if you receive something that has guaranteed delivery

654
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and you say I don't want to receive this anymore,

655
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
then you won't receive it anymore.

656
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And presumably those folks won't be

657
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
charged for the privilege of not being delivered.

658
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But in essence, it's just wrong.

659
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's just wrong.

660
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Strong mail actually is the company

661
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
that we're talking to now about helping pod show,

662
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and it's not because I agree with what's happening.

663
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's just because we have to get moving.

664
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We have to fix this problem now,

665
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and we can't wait,

666
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
because we can't even open up sales

667
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
on the pod sick music network

668
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
without these registrations.

669
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Hey, everybody, raise your right hand for a second.

670
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Go from left to right, say goodbye.

671
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The satellite listeners, Windows closed.

672
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's just us now.

673
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I mean, that would be just us.

674
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It would be me and you and PW Fenton.

675
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay, it's time to send an audio comment to the boss.

676
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Now I know that the boss doesn't really like

677
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
being criticized by the hired help,

678
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
but you should also know that if you say anything bad about me,

679
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
nobody on serious will ever hear it.

680
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But here's the thing.

681
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You are an American.

682
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You are not a Brit.

683
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I love Brits.

684
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't get me wrong.

685
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But Brits are odd people

686
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
who drop syllables from somewhere

687
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
it's like turning military into military.

688
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And then they add syllables to other words,

689
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
like turning aluminum into aluminium.

690
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
They don't need letters or any actual syllables.

691
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They just say a syllable.

692
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This is a fact.

693
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And more importantly,

694
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it is not a controversy.

695
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I love seeing that word.

696
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
As Brits has told you over and over,

697
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
it's a...

698
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That's right.

699
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Controversy.

700
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Hey.

701
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Tell all your listeners that there are two new digital

702
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
flotsome episodes in the shoot.

703
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
First one may be a little weird and different,

704
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
but the second one,

705
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
which should be out a few days later,

706
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
will be more likely shows that they are used to.

707
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Who?

708
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Sorry.

709
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Tailwind.

710
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, Peter.

711
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You fired.

712
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You're in so much trouble now, man.

713
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I can just hear all the Brits going.

714
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What?

715
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Feel free to send in your audio comments for Peter.

716
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Make it creative.

717
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Do some work on it,

718
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
so we can start a real controversy around this.

719
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
By the way,

720
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
aluminium is actually the correct...

721
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's not just the pronunciation.

722
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It is the correct word for the element.

723
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Is that an element?

724
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, for that metal.

725
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Aluminium, not aluminum.

726
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I believe aluminum is absolutely incorrect.

727
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I could be wrong.

728
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Unless it's some kind of derivative of aluminium,

729
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
then we're just talking about two separate things.

730
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The most talking about ayoda,

731
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
the independent online distribution alliance.

732
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
This is an organization I'm learning more about.

733
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They essentially distribute music online.

734
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That would be sales.

735
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And they sit in between record companies,

736
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
mainly independent record companies.

737
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I believe some artists who have their own record companies.

738
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And services like Napster or iTunes, etc.

739
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
We've been talking about their tower records,

740
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
alliance that they've kind of announced.

741
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I think the news got out a little bit before they were ready

742
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
to really talk about it.

743
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Towerpod.com.

744
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
There's not much there right now.

745
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So the idea there is they're going to take their catalog,

746
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
which is six or seven thousand songs.

747
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And any podcast that signs up with them

748
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
will be able to play the songs.

749
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Royalty free.

750
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I presume I haven't seen a license yet.

751
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So I'm not sure if there's any other caveats about

752
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
playing songs in their entirety or talking over intros or anything like that.

753
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And they will be they have a financial model,

754
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
which is advertising.

755
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So advertising.

756
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And this is where I think it kind of breaks down.

757
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Advertising will be split up between the record company,

758
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
who of course splits with the artist,

759
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
with ayoda and with tower records.

760
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And then obviously any affiliate, if they're going to do an affiliate program.

761
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So it seems like it's going to get really, really thin down.

762
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And of course transaction fees,

763
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
with maybe tower stake and care of that.

764
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So it seems like it's going to get really thin.

765
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Now Tim Mitchell,

766
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
who I heard talking at the artist roundtable at podcast hotel

767
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and Seattle recently,

768
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
we discussed that on the Charlie.

769
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
He promised me an audio comment.

770
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And he sent in 15 minutes worth of audio comment.

771
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
A lot of background about himself,

772
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and about ayoda, which is very helpful.

773
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But very little to nothing about what they're actually going to be coming out with.

774
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So I didn't really feel like it was appropriate to roll anything out.

775
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But I will post his 15 minute comments.

776
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So you can have a listen to it.

777
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But he didn't really,

778
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and I don't think he can probably didn't really explain anything about

779
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
about what's coming up with tower records.

780
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So hopefully when he can, he'll let us on the Charlie here.

781
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
No, because obviously I'm excited about anything independent happening.

782
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm also very curious to see how this model's going to work out

783
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
because it's a whole different way of monetizing.

784
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And let me just say one thing.

785
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
As I start to abstract myself a little bit above all that.

786
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Now if you have a podcast, right?

787
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And the podcast consists of audio feedback,

788
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
songs from independent musicians,

789
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and anything that other people create that you put on your podcast.

790
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Just on the pure spec of it,

791
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
you see this, you know, there's two files.

792
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
One could be a file from Matthew Ebel,

793
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and one could be a file from comic strip blogger.

794
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Both of them, creative works of art.

795
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Both of them, MP3 files.

796
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
No difference.

797
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Inter exchangeable.

798
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We'll play on the same devices.

799
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But for some reason, and this is where I think we have to start adjusting

800
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
our thinking.

801
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
For some reason, more value is attached to the song.

802
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And I think that this is artificial.

803
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's an artificial value, which I have no problem with,

804
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
because I like to buy my music.

805
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And I like to support artists.

806
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And it's, you know, people who, you know,

807
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
who make music full time.

808
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's very admirable.

809
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And, you know, I wish everybody could,

810
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I really wish everybody could make money with whatever the hell they're doing.

811
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But there is no difference.

812
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And then again, I don't think there's any difference with a podcast file.

813
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
In fact, I put out more MP3 files than any pod-safe music artist

814
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
that I know.

815
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I put out on a five a week, almost, usually five a week.

816
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
There, gosh, there's sometimes 10 times as large as other files.

817
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yet, they are deemed worthless on a transaction basis.

818
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Although Ricky Jervais, of course, is trying to show that that's not entirely true.

819
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And even he's getting ripped off and put on a bit torrent.

820
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And on some of the peer-to-peer networks.

821
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So if you really just extract yourself a little bit,

822
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
you know, I think we have to be realistic about, you know,

823
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
about trying to shoehorn old models into,

824
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
into the digital world that we live in.

825
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Now, I think that everyone has a right to monetize.

826
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But that doesn't mean that it's a God-given right

827
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and that that value is automatic in my mind.

828
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So my way of monetizing is through advertising.

829
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Most musicians weigh of monetizing is either through sales,

830
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
or I think which is probably even bigger through merchandising

831
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
and through concerts and gigs.

832
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And people who send feedback into the daily source code,

833
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
well, you know, I don't think many people are looking to make any money.

834
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You know, some people really do a lot of work,

835
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and some people do less work.

836
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But take Jeff Smith, as an example,

837
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
is not a published musician.

838
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Actually, I'm sorry.

839
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Let me take that back.

840
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
He doesn't have an album out,

841
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
but he has plenty of songs on the pot-save music network.

842
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
But I know him, not through his pot-save music songs.

843
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I know him through the stuff that he sent into the show,

844
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
you know, stuff like...

845
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'll stop it now because you get excited.

846
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Don't have anything from Roger today either.

847
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So, you know, I want to help him too.

848
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And when people say, hey, you know, who made those great jingles?

849
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Where do I get the ringtone?

850
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll pass them right on to Jeff.

851
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You know, so that's kind of how we work stuff out.

852
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But I think we just have to be very careful about

853
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
carrying over a lot of these old models.

854
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What else was I going to say about that?

855
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, yeah, one more time about the Dutch Azkab BMI,

856
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
the Buma STEM era.

857
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So I was looking at the articles again.

858
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You know, these are the guys that collect the money

859
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
from everybody and everything that could ever play

860
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
a radio or a CD player or anything in their place of business.

861
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And they're supposed to distribute that to the artists.

862
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And what they've done consistently is they've invested that money.

863
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And they usually have a two to three-year delay

864
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
before they start paying out funds, of course,

865
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
it's on a rolling.

866
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So if you start today as an artist

867
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and those public performance rights organizations

868
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
are collecting money for you,

869
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
they don't start to give you money until two or three years.

870
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But then, of course, it continues after that

871
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
if you continue to put out more music.

872
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But in that interim period, they invest your money.

873
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
They've invested in almost 300 different

874
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
investments.

875
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
They don't list what they are in their annual report.

876
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
They had 330 million euros invested

877
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and lost 46 million.

878
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
46 million of other people's money of artists money.

879
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And I want to make mention of this

880
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
because what I don't think people realize is that

881
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
this is, yeah, sure, it's Dutch artists money too.

882
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But this, you know, we're just what's going to happen.

883
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This is going to be huge lawsuits, huge organizations

884
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and from the US, you know, all the big companies

885
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
they're going to come in and they're going to kick these guys

886
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
ass for doing that stuff.

887
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's just unbelievable.

888
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
No regard for intellectual property right there.

889
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I wanted to read you this quote again

890
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
as we talk about the tiered internet.

891
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm not going to make it too long today.

892
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I just have a couple more things I want to play.

893
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
This was from the CEO of SBC, who of course,

894
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
purchased AT&T.

895
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I don't know.

896
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I just got a banner ad here.

897
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
An SAP on business business week.

898
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay.

899
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Let me just find this.

900
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What's his name?

901
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
His name is Ed Something.

902
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Of course, I probably,

903
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
here we go.

904
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
November 7th interview with Business Week online,

905
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
AT&T CEO Edward Whitaker,

906
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Jr. declared,

907
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
quote,

908
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
what Google,

909
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Vonage,

910
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and others would like to do is to use my pipes free,

911
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
but I ain't going to let him do that.

912
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Whitaker and AT&T argue that they need flexibility

913
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
to exact a toll from web services that hog bandwidth.

914
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
As broadband use grows,

915
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
the bells and cable companies say that intensive users

916
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
aren't paying their fair share.

917
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
File shares swapping user can movies account for 60%

918
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
of North American residential broadband use estimates

919
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
David Caputo CEO of Sandvine in Waterloo, Ontario,

920
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
which sells technology to manage network traffic.

921
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yet over eaters get preferential treatment

922
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
over weaker ones.

923
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So the main thing here is that this guy,

924
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Edward Whitaker, Jr. said,

925
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Google, Vonage, and others.

926
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And I'm really looking at Google more than Vonage.

927
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Vonage is voice over IP.

928
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's a whole different thing about who's packets

929
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
to get delivered and all the shit that's all.

930
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's frightening is really what it is.

931
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Got some feedback on it.

932
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Aloha, Adam,

933
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
this is the digital slot curve brando

934
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
from the digital slot pod podcast at digitalslob.com.

935
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I've been listening intently lately

936
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
to the DSC or the Charlie or the Cha Cha

937
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
or the Chimachanga lately,

938
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
especially episodes in the upper 340s,

939
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
about the so-called tiered internet.

940
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm glad you're shedding light on this complex,

941
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
but important topic.

942
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm writing about it this week in my syndicated humor column.

943
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I just wanted to bounce this metaphor off you and you're

944
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
maybe your listeners and the hopes of boiling it all down

945
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
into a nice little edible bond mall.

946
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You can tell me how on the market might be.

947
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
As it stands right now,

948
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
the birthday party photos I forwarded to my sister

949
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
bounce around in the same sandbox at amazon.com

950
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
uses to ship us whatever Oprah tells us to read,

951
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
but cable companies want a higher profile piece of the action.

952
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It seems to me even though they're basically just a utility.

953
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's too bad because rich people can already

954
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
buy huge TVs, expensive clothes and nonstop flights

955
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
to Europe and seats that were flying all the way back.

956
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But even then there are limits.

957
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I mean, even they can't write a check,

958
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
so big it would allow them to flush a pot roast

959
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
down the toilet.

960
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
A rising digital age tide should raise all ships in my opinion.

961
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And that means raising the bar not only for excellence,

962
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
but for mediocrity as well.

963
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Let me give you an example.

964
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Weeks ago I created a song called Digital Slop Pod Fever

965
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and uploaded it to the Pod Safe Music Network.

966
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Thanks to royalty-free music loops,

967
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
drag and drop functionality in my wife's voice.

968
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
She owed me a favor for making me sit through a mat

969
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and they have chicken little.

970
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Anyway, I made a song.

971
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It was rancid and a bismal by every measure,

972
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
but a song anyway.

973
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's still free for the taking on the PMN.

974
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I guess a little bit like the way a tire fire would be free

975
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
for the taking for anyone who wanted to cart it away.

976
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But even as bad as it is,

977
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
if I took it back in time,

978
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm pretty sure I could get a record deal

979
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and airtime on MTV between Mickey

980
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
by Tony Bazel and I ran by Flocke Seagulls.

981
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It even ended up, as it turns out,

982
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
as an intro to music on the mic,

983
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Marka Barshow out of Amsterdam a while back.

984
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The point, however,

985
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
is that the song was made and is available,

986
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
thanks in part to the universally available web

987
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
that's fast enough and cheap enough to move it around.

988
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And to an ego big enough to insist I wasted an entire day

989
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
making it.

990
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But if I'm ever to take my musical career to the next level

991
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
from awful 80s,

992
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
one hit wonder to awful 21st century Mozart,

993
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
you can bet I would need a smarter application

994
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
bigger memory and a faster internet

995
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and it's got to be roughly the same price

996
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
for else it won't happen.

997
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Any more investment on the front end would require

998
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
some initial talent,

999
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
not to mention a divorce.

1000
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I suspect the next would be Google

1001
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
or it would be Amazon.com would be in a similar predicament.

1002
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But given the same tools,

1003
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
imagine what someone with true abilities

1004
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
would be able to accomplish.

1005
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So, let's not organize the web

1006
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
like the Titanic,

1007
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
stifling the best and brightest way back in the series.

1008
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Let's push all our pipe dreams

1009
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
through the same pipe.

1010
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That's the bond model there.

1011
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Okay, sure.

1012
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Wondering.

1013
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Mahalo Adam and let me know

1014
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
when I can join the PD and party

1015
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
because I know there's a line forming

1016
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
that's longer than the one to get into the Don

1017
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
who showed down at the Waikiki Beach Comer.

1018
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Just a bit of feedback from your friendly

1019
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
neighborhood digital slob.

1020
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Aloha.

1021
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Mahalo Aloha.

1022
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Okay.

1023
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
All right.

1024
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So, I have a whole bunch of different comments

1025
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
about that which I'm going to save until tomorrow

1026
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
at towards the end of the show.

1027
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We'll do a thank God it's Friday edition.

1028
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Hopefully, a celebratory edition.

1029
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That would be very cool.

1030
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Of course, I'll be posting something

1031
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
on curry.com later today

1032
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
if I have anything to report

1033
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and I surely hope I do

1034
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
sometimes as I stated before,

1035
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
you know, the courts will just say,

1036
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
oh, you know, we actually put the judgment

1037
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and envelope sent it off.

1038
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You'll have it by Monday.

1039
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's happened to me before.

1040
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Believe me.

1041
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
One final piece of information

1042
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
which pertains to podcasters.

1043
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
This comes from duck from the rock cast

1044
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Italia from Italy.

1045
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Of course.

1046
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Adam, you were right.

1047
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's dangerous to put our podcasters

1048
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in the hands of others.

1049
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I'm not quite sure what that was about.

1050
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Oh, I see.

1051
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Right now feed burner is unreachable

1052
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
from the most important ADSL provider in Italy.

1053
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And it's been like this since Saturday.

1054
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It looks like other parts of Europe are affected too.

1055
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Feed burner is aware of the problem,

1056
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
but can't do much.

1057
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And here's what they said.

1058
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And I'll quote from the email.

1059
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
We've received a report from our hosting provider

1060
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
stating that there is a routing

1061
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
slash peering problem

1062
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
between global crossing and sea bone.

1063
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Unfortunately, this problem is outside

1064
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
of the control of both feed burner

1065
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and the providers that feed burner is connected to.

1066
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
There's currently no estimated time of arrival on

1067
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
when this problem will be resolved.

1068
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We will continue to communicate with our providers

1069
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and pass on any additional information

1070
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
as it becomes available.

1071
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So that's a huge problem.

1072
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That can happen to any ISP.

1073
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So the way it works.

1074
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And this is exactly what could happen

1075
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
with teared internet.

1076
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Remember we talked about peering the other day.

1077
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So global crossing and sea bone,

1078
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
both are backbone providers.

1079
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And the agreements that these huge backbone providers

1080
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
like AT&T have is,

1081
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
look, you hand off X amount of traffic,

1082
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
all hand off X amount of traffic to you.

1083
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And since it's kind of the same,

1084
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
we call it a wash,

1085
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
no money changes hands,

1086
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and they call that peering.

1087
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Which comes from the telco world in general,

1088
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
where there's a settlement at the end of the month.

1089
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You know, if I make a call from you through

1090
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
two here in the UK to your phone,

1091
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
which is through AT&T in the States.

1092
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
At the end of the month,

1093
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
there's a settlement in the two companies.

1094
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You know, say, okay,

1095
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
you know, I sent these calls to you.

1096
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That'll be you know,

1097
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
$3 million.

1098
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And they say, okay,

1099
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
well, we had $2.7 million.

1100
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And so they figure all of that stuff out.

1101
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
This huge systems that calculate that.

1102
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But on internet traffic,

1103
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
it's almost impossible to count it.

1104
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So the or at least down to,

1105
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
you know, some particular levels.

1106
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That's what IPv6 is supposed to solve.

1107
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Look, I'm not a technologist in that, in that regard.

1108
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But here it is.

1109
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So there's, I think I've looked for it.

1110
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Any border gateway protocol

1111
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
geeks out there who want to help us out with

1112
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
what the dispute is between global crossing

1113
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
and seabone.

1114
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Please let me know.

1115
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It sounds like there's a dispute probably saying,

1116
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
hey, you know, we're not getting off traffic from you.

1117
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So we're breaking our peering agreement.

1118
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It could be something like that.

1119
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And this is exactly what could happen

1120
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
with a multi-tiered internet.

1121
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So now a large part of Europe,

1122
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Italy is a pretty large part.

1123
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Cannot reach feed burner and other parts of the world

1124
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
may be affected as well.

1125
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
In fact, while I'm here right now,

1126
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
why don't I just check to see if I can reach them.

1127
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Feed burner dot com.

1128
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And yeah, no problem.

1129
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
No problem from the UK on easy net.

1130
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So that works.

1131
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
At the end of the day, my friends,

1132
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
where there comes to lawsuits, arguments,

1133
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
broken peering agreements, theft,

1134
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
endangerment,

1135
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
when all of a sudden done

1136
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and when it all comes down to it,

1137
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
there's only one type of person

1138
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
that wins consistently.

1139
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
There are rats.

1140
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
There are bats.

1141
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There are sting,

1142
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
community cats.

1143
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But the worst thing in the world

1144
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
is a lawyer.

1145
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
There are easels.

1146
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
There are scones.

1147
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
There are bandits.

1148
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
There are pups.

1149
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But the worst thing in the world

1150
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
is a lawyer.

1151
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
With their clips and their committees.

1152
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Their fees and their contingencies.

1153
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
There are lies.

1154
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
There are my spare lots of things

1155
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
but the worst thing in the world is a lawyer.

1156
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000

But the worst thing in the world is a lawyer

1165
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
With their proximate causes

1166
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And their escape causes

1167
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yes, the worst thing in the world is a lawyer

1168
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
With a firmative defenses

1169
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I would rather see a dentist

Yes, the worst thing in the world is a lawyer

1171
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So long now

1172
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000

Lullaby for lawyers

Actually some of my best friends are lawyers

1187
