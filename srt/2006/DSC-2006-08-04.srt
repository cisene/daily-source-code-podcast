00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
This is Soccer Girl. I just listened to the first episode of Shadow Falls and it's scared me

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,280
crapless.

Daily source code episode 435.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,960
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,480
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,440
Hello, I am Carrey. Thanks for playing Liberty Jones on your podcast Daily source code.

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,680
Heavenly Liberty Jones works in the shop that she owns.

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:26,240
Lessons to music like swing. When there's no customer's in,

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,720
just because she don't like to drive. Take the sea as step by.

13
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:48,640
And these are thoughts on the sides to the river at night.

14
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,720
Turn my face.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,640
This is the old something why don't you come for me. Take me away from my face.

16
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,680
She's got a dream to arrive.

17
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,560
And this name wouldn't lie.

18
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,680
If things are lonely, desire.

19
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,480
This is the worst of fate why don't you come for me to tell me your way.

20
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
Keep the lines.

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Please let your so far. I wish you would buy. We could go buy back to my place.

22
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:24,400
Please let your so free. Why don't you come for me. Take me away from the place.

23
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:56,400
I'll give some joy. When the face of life is so true,

24
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,600
she won't dream that I know.

25
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:11,520
Heavenly Liberty Jones, Heavenly Liberty Jones,

26
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:21,760
Heavenly Liberty Jones works in the shop that she owns.

27
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:36,640
I could play that song 10 times a day. Particularly now, I've a customized intro to it.

28
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,240
Love it. The shakes, Liberty Jones, you can find on the pot set music network.

29
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,920
Hey everybody, it's Friday. Welcome to the daily source code coming to you from Curry Cottage

30
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,920
in the affluent suburb of Surrey in Guilford in the United Kingdom.

31
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,000
No lady Patricia today because today it's all music promos and crap you've called in.

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,160
Hi Adam. I'm Kate Alyson from the UK. We all know the association you've generated between

33
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,280
the birth and the sensei. I'm wondering if you've got some other associations going on that you haven't

34
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,760
told us about. I asked because I got a bit behind listening to the Charlie. I know I'm awful.

35
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,680
But I'll listen to four episodes yesterday and I think you've got a subliminal message

36
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,920
going on in your dozzet times. So I had a very, very hot dream about you last night. You know what

37
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm going to ask for Adam, naked pictures. Okay, that's it. Apart from you today, I'm a folder.

38
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,280
Hi Adam. She dreams hot of me and she's a folder. It doesn't get any better than that.

39
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,800
Oh yes, of course. I'll send you naked pictures. Do you send me some of your first?

40
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,560
Huh? Don't send them to Adamaccurry.com. That crap's not working anymore. Adam and pod show.com.

41
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,800
I have so much just to run through. That's what I'm Jewish and I talked about this morning. I

42
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
was saying, you know, why would we just do a show together on Monday? And let me just run through

43
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,120
everything. I must have, you know, 30 different things I want people to hear and it's promos. It's a

44
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,920
cool music. People are sent in and it's Friday. So we shouldn't have to think too much. I promoted

45
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,080
on Curry.com yesterday. I blogged about my sister and her husband in Italy. They're now producing

46
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,760
movies, a little mini movies with her kids in Italian with English subtitles. You can find that

47
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:26,960
at minimovies.podshow.com is totally cool. The first one is Robin Hood. It's very, very cute. Please

48
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:37,120
have a look at that. Pod show garage is now officially launched at garage or garage.podshow.com.

49
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm just reading the legends. So you know what it's about. Welcome to the pod show garage.

50
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,440
Here, the pod show mechanics. We're posting updates, bugs, fixes, tips, tricks and solving

53
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,280
subscribe to their to their weblog garage or garage.podshow.com fantastic resource. I have a feeling

54
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,080
podshow Joe is behind that. A couple of people sent me this about Wikipedia. And I'm not going to

55
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,080
play the whole clip. This must be old actually. I thought I saw most in the past three weeks.

56
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,880
I saw just about every Cold Bear report that the show that comes on after the daily show with John

57
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,160
Stewart and he's talking about Wikipedia. Let me just play a little clip here. All right. I got an

58
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,120
angry email from some nut job in Oregon today. Apparently the city of Portland does not put

59
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,840
hashish in their baby formula. My mistake. All right. Oh, opening my while crafting my scorching

60
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,000
reply. I forgot whether I usually call Oregon California's Canada or Washington's Mexico.

61
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,080
So I went to the internet and cyclopedia Wikipedia to check their extensive entry on this show.

62
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,520
I love Wikipedia. Any site that's got a longer entry on truthiness than on Lutherans has its

63
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:07,200
priorities straight. Anyway, turns out I called Oregon both California's Canada

64
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,880
and he's coming to a point here. He's coming to a point here. Washington's Mexico. But thinking

65
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,520
about it now, that's giving Oregon too much credit. They're more like Idaho's Portugal.

66
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:25,040
So what I am going to do, he pulls out a laptop. I'm going to just log on to Wikipedia here

67
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:33,440
and I am going to change it. You see, any user can change any entry. And if enough other users

68
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,200
agree with them, it becomes true. No big laugh. No big laugh from the crowd because I don't think

69
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,160
they quite understood it. But that is exactly what's happening. Whenever a whole bunch of people stand

70
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,880
around something that's then it becomes true on the internet. I've seen this time and time again.

71
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,920
And there's this whole, I was in Wikimedia conference going on. I think it's in Boston.

72
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,120
I'm pretty sure it's in Boston. And I believe that they will come to the conclusion at the end of

73
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,240
the day for anything to be reliable. Really, I think I really do believe you have to have

74
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,080
some kind of editorial that becomes believable. It just doesn't seem to work when it's

75
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,600
done in a social manner. It always results in the flame in a flame war. Nothing else ever really

76
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,400
comes of it, unfortunately. Hey Adam Curry. I think I dial the wrong number a second ago,

77
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,600
but I am your new biggest fan. And I'm just interested in that contest for a try and

78
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,480
need an iPod. And that's so cool that you're given in one since you started the contest. But

79
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:50,560
Godfather, please help me. I registered and I don't know where to post the URL of the one that I

80
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:59,120
registered. Because the name of the website that registered can hopefully to win is www.do not

81
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,400
get a iPod off of eBay or Google win one from Adam Curry. And the whole little joke about that is

82
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,200
when you go that would say, I'll pull up one of those banner ads that is just a scam that says,

83
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,680
oh, win an iPod or whatever. So love a show, keep it up and I'm a scruncher and I think I'm not sure

84
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,960
my arms will hold it, but I don't want to find out. I think you should find out. I need to know if

85
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,760
this is a hereditary or not. Apparently not. If I listen to you, if your mom's a scruncher,

86
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
you're a folder or vice versa, what was your dad? We've got to know these things. This is important

87
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,560
and remember, it is for science. So I started checking early this morning. I know I promised I

88
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,360
would announce the winner of the tronydsnipod.com contest today. Very simple contest. If you're

89
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,280
just tuning in, Troy started with tronydsnipod.com. And I kind of like the whole concept and

90
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,000
asked listeners to go ahead and register the most creative, most interesting, most funny, etc.

91
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,440
URL. And of course, extra points for what it actually points to for what the URL, what domain

92
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:07,120
pops up when you type in that URL. And I didn't get through them all today. So you have

93
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,880
a whole weekend now to finish posting a daily source code.com because I have to check every single

94
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,320
one and see if it's actually real. A lot of people put it as Troy had already warned me. A lot of

95
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,680
people put in entries that aren't actually registered, the just ideas. Well, the whole point is you

96
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,520
kind of have to register. It doesn't have to be with GoDaddy using checkout code DSC3. You could

97
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,120
probably go over to earth Lincoln figured out there or to any ISP or any domain register. I really

98
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,760
don't care. I really don't care, but you have to have it registered. And so I guess Monday,

99
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,160
when the lady Patricia's back on the show, we will bring you the winner of the iPod in the

100
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:50,560
tronydsnipod.com contest. Voidware prohibited by law. And I'm the final judge, right?

101
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Mark need day and night.

102
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,200
Here is the room with your hair a little. There's a tiny problem about the usual.

103
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,320
It's about Mark. Yoshi knows he wants his face. He said he's labelled as cast.

104
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:23,120
He can't read his without his age writers. Mark need day and writers. He's a bad

105
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,320
he does with a pathetic show. Sticking up serious radio. He's getting obsessed with

106
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,560
give them the girl who do a daily show. That kicks ass without the help of a writer.

107
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Eight fucking writers. Mark need day and night.

108
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Mark need day and night.

109
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Mark need day and night. Mark need day and night. Mark need day and night. Mark need day and night.

110
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,560
Mark need day and night. Mark need day and night. Mark need day and night. Mark need day and night.

111
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:29,280
Mark need day and night. Mark need day and night. Mark need day and night. Sometimes there's a

112
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,120
And I'm going to need a broveskeet.

113
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,280
And I'm going to need a broveskeet, but the hell is a broveskeet?

114
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,520
That's heard that one, who wears this?

115
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,120
And I'm going to need a broveskeet.

116
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,600
I have no idea what you're saying there.

117
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,320
I thought the thought was, although not pod save very amusing.

118
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,600
And if Mark needs eight riders, then I'll get him six more.

119
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Having this Saturday, August 5th on the Ed's Mix Bad Podcast.

120
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,760
A very special episode indeed.

121
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,760
The story is behind some of her early music as told by the rock goddess herself.

122
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,760
So fear, Ramos.

123
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,000
Hi, this is your host Ed Ovet, and I'm psyched.

124
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,720
It is an honor to invite you to come along for the ride, as we explore together some

125
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,040
of Sophia's life's story.

126
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,880
Sophia has especially prepared the audio content in this show exclusively for the Ed's Mix Bad

127
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Podcast.

128
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,760
So how cool is that?

129
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,280
Don't miss a single word of this multi-talented artist as I present her majesty, Sophia Ramos,

130
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,200
coming to a podcast you're near you on Saturday, August 5th, 2006.

131
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:14,440
On episode number 44 of Ed, Mix Bad.

132
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Hello, I've been Roger here, I was just leaving you a message to ask if you want to

133
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,440
any help next time you go flying, now don't have any experience with flying a plane, but

134
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,440
I did it to drive a car once until I crashed it, but I'm sure it's not easy in the sky,

135
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,960
there's not so many people to run over, I'm sure if you want to say some of your drugs

136
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,200
to 10,000 C, I can hold you a shaft straight while you get your morphine out, you want

137
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,440
to join Richard Branson or Buddy Harley, the big bop her as well, big names, the societic

138
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,320
with celebrity aviation, and just let me know which day you're free, and I'll come up with

139
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
you.

140
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:58,880
Roger, so good to hear from you dear, maybe we should forego that trip, I'm not quite sure

141
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,080
I like the company you suggest we should be here.

142
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,040
Adam, this is Peter from Suffolk and Cool, yeah you heard it right, Suffolk and Cool.

143
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,760
When I started my shows six months ago to play in a collecting mix of only the finest

144
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,320
new music, I took a pride in listening to each and every one of the 50 or so new tunes

145
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,040
coming on to the PMN every week.

146
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,720
Life was good, we even met up for beer and darts at the brick layers arms, I would have

147
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,080
him to the draft, you and Ron and Chris seem such good eggs despite your odd colonial

148
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,600
accents, not from Patricia seemed even better eggs, then there was talk of giving up

149
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,320
the day job, ah happy days.

150
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,040
That was then, this is now, I'm still panning through the new tunes to find the very

151
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,760
finest gems to pop discreetly into the years of the Suffolk and Cool listeners, but

152
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,520
man am I getting tired and techy, with over 400 new tunes on the PMN since last week's

153
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,040
show, where am I supposed to sleep?

154
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,640
I never seen my family, the cats won't speak to me, and I've given up the day job because

155
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,840
I've just no time to do it.

156
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:09,920
So please, musicians, can they break, are just controlling yourselves, you're driving me crazy?

157
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,040
The only seller I can find is listening to great music, which is all on the pubslave music

158
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
work.

159
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:25,880
Yeah, I didn't have a thought about that as I heard your comment, I think it's almost

160
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,840
time we set up some streaming servers, I think it would make a lot of sense to create

161
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,360
a couple of streams that you can just listen to, and this may be for people who are producing

162
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,240
podcasts, well, it could also be for people who want to discover new music, but what if

163
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,120
we had just a continuous stream of the new songs that come into the podcast music networks?

164
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,680
So maybe there's, I don't know, let's see, maybe 30 or 40 songs in rotation, and whenever

165
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,400
new one comes in, the oldest one drops out and just continues that way.

166
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,720
So if you kind of left that on during the day, in the background, you might actually hear

167
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,440
something you like, or we could do it by genre, but I agree, there's no way you can

168
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,480
log in anymore every morning and just listen to all the songs that there's just too much

169
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,680
coming in, which of course is, you know, why you might want to go take a look at songs

170
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,280
that are getting the most pod play, click on the shows that have played those songs,

171
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,480
because there's a high likelihood that they'll have more songs in there that you like,

172
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,600
and on each song, you can see which other shows played those songs.

173
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,760
This goes for producers of podcasts as well as for listeners.

174
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,680
So once we get that all integrated into pod show plus, it'll be even cooler when you can

175
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,280
actually have an identity as a band in pod show plus or as a label, or check this one out,

176
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,680
how about as a venue?

177
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:44,520
Hi Adam, this is Gus Koveta from a betterdaymedia.com, and to MiamiPodcast.com.

178
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,440
You know, I was sitting here, finally getting a chance to catch up on some of your recent

179
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,120
episodes from the daily source code, and I started thinking as I was looking at your

180
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,120
picture on iTunes, man, this guy needs to get some sun.

181
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,040
He says, why does it go?

182
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,080
Hey, I figured, you know what, he spends most of his time either in the UK, which is not

183
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,440
the sunnyest place in the world, or in Northern California.

184
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,200
So I thought since he probably don't have time to get away and get yourself some sun,

185
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,280
maybe I should bring a little sunshine to you.

186
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,560
So why don't you sit back, pop open a cool one, put on some sunglasses, and click on over

187
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,480
to my new show called the MiamiPodcast.

188
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,960
Basically every week, I'll bring you the latest information on what's happening here in

189
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,760
the Magic City, and who's it happening to.

190
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,720
Also, every week, I'll feature some great pot-safe music by both local and international

191
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
artists.

192
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,280
So if you can't get down here for your tan, listen to our show at the MiamiPodcast.com,

193
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,840
and I'll try to make you feel as if you were here.

194
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,040
So for now, Adam, child, and keep up the good work, man.

195
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:52,600
And folder, scruncher, see, almost the perfect audio comment, close, very, very close.

196
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,880
Oh, to New York City now, the David E. Polito, known as the, that guitar in the central

197
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,600
park, dude, man, person.

198
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:34,720
But you don't think he's overpaid, but you're at the profits with 36 billion, so when

199
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,960
you retire, you give him 400 million co-hexons.

200
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:51,800
You've been raining the public routine, because you have what they need on, so you pay

201
00:20:51,800 --> 00:21:08,760
your success, so I'm seeing you, you're the portrait of Grito at some.

202
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:21,200
I've seen you on CNN, I've never seen such oily men, double-talking world, and think

203
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:29,600
it suffices, make funny excuses, both these record prices, you know the truth you

204
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:41,120
cannot sell, the same reason my dog licks himself, you say you said prices on supply and

205
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:50,600
demand, but let's just be honest, you do cause you can't away some, when you merge

206
00:21:50,600 --> 00:22:01,840
you became an example, and you double the way, oh, it's on, you could drift into warming,

207
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,560
that's global, clashes melting away, oh, it's on.

208
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:29,240
The bucket once makes sense, but now something's off, it's since your secret meetings,

209
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:38,920
it takes chains on, but so it's on, you just take and you take and keep taking, and your

210
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:48,920
concern is a scam, oh, it's on, it's so clear, but look for a bit of your making, that you

211
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:59,320
don't give a care more, it's on, getting rich on the back of this nation, and double

212
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:19,000
your home, it's on, he bought screwing the next generation, I say screwing, oh, yes, he's the

213
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,400
guy who plays this guitar in Central Park, he's got a podcast, he's got tons of songs of

214
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,240
the pot-set music network, his name is David E. Polito, links to him of course in today's

215
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:37,520
show notes at dailysourcecode.com, awesome dude, although of course I have to disagree with you,

216
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,720
just to take an unpopular stance, yeah, you see those big profits, the oil companies are

217
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:52,920
making, what you probably will see in the next five years is huge investments, and it'll

218
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,360
come from those profits, those profits don't go all, don't all go directly to shareholders,

219
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,320
it's not all paid out in dividends, there's a huge reinvestment, I know personally at this

220
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,160
juncture of two different oil refineries that are being built, and they're not being built

221
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:16,760
by one oil company but by several because the cost is about $8 billion per refinery because

222
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,880
now they're doing a liquid, liquid to petroleum refining, this is the way it's going to go until

223
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,320
until there is no more until of course we have sucked the earth dry and that's not the oil

224
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,520
companies fault, that's our fault, it's everyone's fault, new, for not using alternative means of

225
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,120
energy. If you're on serious right now, you'd like to talk some more about that top shit,

226
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,360
you'll have to download the rest of the show at dailysourcecode.com, coming up in the pod show,

227
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,200
though, on serious specific coastal way, Dawn and Drew, in over your head, which you talk

228
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,320
rather for the scenes in yeast radio and other Scottsigler extravagans into wind up your Friday

229
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:58,200
evening. Bye, they're gone, I mean that though, I mean that about the oil companies, yeah,

230
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,840
sure it's a bummer, we're paying a lot of money, now to fill up our gas-guzzling machines, which

231
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,640
you know, I've taken my own personal steps, I'm driving Trinity, I'm filling it up with

232
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,200
vegetable oil, which is not cheap, by the way, it's more expensive than regular diesel,

233
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,080
significantly more expensive, but at least I'm not paying an oil company, so I could make it myself

234
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,720
if I wanted to, so that's up to me and that's up to you as well. Believe me, these oil companies,

235
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,040
all these big profits, it's not necessarily like they're all going into a couple of people's pockets

236
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,080
because the reinvestments will come and they haven't been huge cash cows, all their existence,

237
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,880
that also is not true. So, what it's fun, you know, it's fun to have someone to yell at

238
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:46,360
when you can barely afford to a Philip de Homme! Hello Adam, and all my fellow Charlie Ice,

239
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,120
I'm Mike Pico, voice of Scotty Oz and the Children of the Gods podcast. I still have a day job,

240
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,400
and at my day job, I have a great guy who does some part-time work for us. He, along with his fellow

241
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:03,080
team members, we're currently training to participate in the Orlando Triathlon on September 24th

242
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,960
as representatives of the leukemia and lymphoma society, and their mission to cure leukemia and

243
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:14,440
phoma, by Loma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Eric, that's the name, is doing this in part because

244
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,880
cancer has stricken very close to him recently. I won't go into details here, but please go to

245
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:27,240
www.helpaskyourcancer.com and make a donation to help Eric and his team get this event.

246
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,720
I told Eric that I was sending this to you and Adam, he said that voicemail updates were a

247
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,400
phone or are not out of question. We've seen podcasts and do a lot of good for good causes in the past.

248
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,960
I think we still have another one in us. I think we can do it again. One last thing, if I haven't

249
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,240
sold you on a yet, I'll leave you with this. If you don't get cancer yourself, then chances are

250
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:54,280
someone so close to you will that it will be devastating. Please help www.helpaskyourcancer.com

251
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,000
I were definitely going to cure cancer. I'm sure of that. I don't think my daughter

252
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,960
when she's mature. I don't think she'll have all the same problems that we have here.

253
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,360
And of course, anyway, we can help happy to do it. Oh man, since my mom passed away,

254
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,560
I've had so many different offers of, you know, to join boards of directors and stuff.

255
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,040
I think that probably the best way I can help is just by giving it exposure. Of course,

256
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,640
it's not just cancer. It's all kinds of stuff. But we're getting close to solving a lot of these

257
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,560
things. Research is going very, very fast. And I have good hopes. I really do. I think that

258
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:36,760
in 20 years we'll have cancer like no, no, not about it. Hi Adam. It's Ralph, with a comment about

259
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,520
jig and the skewing of story stories. Oh yeah, let me explain this one for a second.

260
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,120
This actually goes back to what I said at the beginning of the show about Wikipedia.

261
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,120
So Jason Calacanis, who you probably, well, if you're in the blogger's career,

262
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,240
Potter's career, then you might have heard of him if not, then you probably don't know who he is.

263
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,560
But he started web, I look, I've known him for a long time. He was at Silicon Valley in New York

264
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,360
in the bubble days. And even pre-bubble days. He's been around for a long time. And I consider

265
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:14,760
him a good acquaintance. He, um, so he started weblogging and then he sold that to AOL. And now he,

266
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,920
I'll just, I'll popularize what people are saying. He's recreating dig at netscape.com. Whether you

267
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,680
think that's true or not is irrelevant, that's just the easiest way to explain what he's doing.

268
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,960
If you don't know what dig.com is, you have to go to digg.com to understand. It's kind of a social

269
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,200
bookmarking site. So there's a community there and they dig stories and articles and the ones that

270
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,960
the most people dig rise to the top. And of course, they get a lot of attention. And that spreads

271
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,320
out throughout the network effect that these stories can get. You know, they show up in email

272
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:53,240
and you're aggregator all over the place. And Jason's plan, which I think is a very interesting one,

273
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,160
is to hire people to really start seeding these stories. Let's call, he calls them navigators,

274
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:06,120
I think, so kind of like editors. Exactly what I said, I believe you do need in any social scenario.

275
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,480
Well, I mean, even here take blogger con as an example, the uncomference, even blogger con has

276
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:19,000
discussion leaders. Now, it's very hard to emulate a discussion leader on a website other than

277
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,960
having giving that person moderating tools. So they can shut someone up, i.e. do not give the

278
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,600
microphone away, which is a big rule of these uncomferences now, so that someone can't hog the

279
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,840
microphone except for this discussion leader. So I think it makes a lot of sense that you have people

280
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,160
who moderate these conversations. Now, there are of course also marketing companies out there who

281
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:47,480
are paying people to go and spike stories that are about their companies to get those rise to the top.

282
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,360
This is exactly what I said. This is what happens in any free open system where there's no

283
00:29:52,520 --> 00:30:01,160
penalty from its behaving. We actually run our own technology news website aimed at the Irish market.

284
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:09,560
It's www.electricnews.net.inn.ie. I have to say I have some concerns about companies

285
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:16,440
paying to get legitimate news stories pumped up in these social networks. I think it can be

286
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:25,480
a terrible way of skewing what's news and what's not news. It's that challenge about trying to

287
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,840
ascertain what is a genuine news story that stands up on its own merits and what this essentially

288
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:38,440
being pumped primed and is essentially nothing more than a editorial for a company that has a

289
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,840
little mention somewhere and then gets pumped up to a level that's way beyond its merit.

290
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,480
I think it's wrong, but I'm not entirely sure what you would do to stop it. I'd be interested

291
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,120
with other listeners have views on how you would be able to actually prevent social networks

292
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,400
like dig from being skewed like that. I can't see any easy way around it. That's why I thought

293
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:10,280
it's always a folder. I think it's very much real. I think their own really only is one solution.

294
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,640
You have to have editors and maybe that's where it all boils back down to weblog. Someone who is

295
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:22,440
providing links on a weblog. Robert Skobel for the techies is a good example of that. I read

296
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,760
scripting news every day. You don't have to agree with or like the editor, but I think that's

297
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,880
kind of what you're looking for is you find a person that you think is trustworthy for whatever

298
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,280
reason or even if you know they're not trustworthy for whatever reason or you know they have secondary

299
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:46,760
agendas. Maybe we should be concentrating on a Wikipedia like open forum about editors.

300
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,680
Well, of course, that would be a weblog about weblogs about weblogs. So really, when it all comes

301
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:59,480
down to its social bookmarking sites, really cool idea, but humanity just doesn't work that way.

302
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,240
Sorry to say. Okay, getting you ready for some cool stuff to listen to over the weekend.

303
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:12,760
The strip podcast, which you can find at the strip.podshow.com or I think it's the strip.com as

304
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,520
well. Why don't I know these things? Link in the show notes, of course. They are members of the

305
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:24,440
Podshow podcast network. We got so many now. I got to have my cheat sheets. Actually, I found out

306
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,120
about this through a press release through one of our own press releases. They've got a fantastic

307
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,720
show that you have to listen to this weekend. I think they already have a new show in the works,

308
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,520
but you got to listen to this week on the strip. She took off like a rocket. Her first two albums

309
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,280
producing eight top 10 hits, winning five Grammys, and selling a combined 15 million copies.

310
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,280
But Tony Braxton's recent career has been less than stellar, so she's looking for a return

311
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,200
to prominence by settling down for a long-term headlining gig at the Flamingo.

312
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,600
See, it's chat with a sexy shunt who's coming up. Then we review the Red Rock resort in casino.

313
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,200
Alright, so you got to listen to this with Tony Braxton. You want to hear someone who got

314
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,920
completely screwed by the record business, and literally for her multi-million selling album

315
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,880
wound up with $2,000 in her pocket. And memories of a lot of great limo rides,

316
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,240
plain rides, hotels, and studio recording sessions. But you might want to check it out at

317
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,600
the strippodcast.com. So I know it was sent to me via email. Some of the checkout from the label

318
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,680
no less, but it is on the podcast using that word.

319
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:03,160
I met Ronel Tray coming home from a top I know she hates it and I said, it's used

320
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:09,160
my favorite to your half-time. I believe I made it. She said, six o'clock, but if I was you,

321
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:15,480
I wouldn't worry about that. Because in this life, there ain't no turning back.

322
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:24,280
Cause nothing less forever. So let's keep it real. Let's make a most of everything that we've

323
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:33,640
built. It's after such a change. No, there's a way. I know you can't say, but hey, I'm glad

324
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:44,440
it's okay. And just like sitting down watching the way. It's so much more I want to say.

325
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:02,680
But want us to grow. I don't want to say, hey, I'll see you around. But that's just the way

326
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:11,720
it is sometimes sometimes you get laid down. Cause nothing less forever. So let's keep it real.

327
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:21,400
Let's make a most of everything that we've built. It's after such a change. No, there's a way.

328
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:31,240
I know you can't say, but hey, I'm glad it's okay. And just like sitting down watching the way.

329
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:41,320
There's so much more I want to say. And let's remember watching the way.

330
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:59,960
Ooh. Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, let it take. She's walking away. Nothing less forever.

331
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:10,920
So let's keep it real. Let's make a most of everything that we've built. It's after such a change.

332
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,920
No, there's a way, I know you can't stay, but hey, I'm glad it's okay

333
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,920
And just like sitting down watching away

334
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,920
There's so much more I want to say

335
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,920
Nothing's in store, nothing is real

336
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Do what you want, do what you feel

337
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,920
I pick up the phone, but there's not a sound

338
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,920
It's something to hear, got my feet on the ground

339
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,920
And just like sitting down watching away

340
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,920
There's so much more I don't want to say

341
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,920
Nothing's in store, nothing is real

342
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Nothing's in store, nothing is real

343
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,920
Pretty cool, huh?

344
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Rich Kronen, find him on the podcast and music network

345
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Links in today's show notes at dailysourceco.com

346
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,920
Nothing lasts forever

347
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
I like that song

348
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,920
I've been asking you to call in and introduce yourselves

349
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,920
As listeners of the Daily Source Code

350
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,920
I've got quite a bundle now, and I want you to keep doing that

351
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Because when we start up next week is listener of the day

352
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Yes, listener of the day, and you'll get a pod show

353
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
I think I'm on the show t-shirt

354
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
So I want to send one out every single day

355
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
And just by highlighting one listener

356
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,920
So call in to our voice mail number and tell us who you are

357
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
How old you are, what you do, where you're from

358
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,920
And of course most importantly, if you're a scruncher or a folder

359
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
So we can keep telling you of that

360
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
So yeah, I'm learning about you guys

361
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,920
And already I know that the audience is all over the map

362
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
It's phenomenal

363
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
I'm not going to play any of those today

364
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,920
I have a couple more comments that came into the voice mail line

365
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Which you can reach out

366
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Go ahead, get a pen

367
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,920
Get it, just open up a little note pad thingy

368
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Or a sticky note if you're on a Mac

369
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Or if you have your mobile phone

370
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,920
Enter this number and you can save it in a second

371
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Plus one

372
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
201

373
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
625

374
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
6357

375
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
And just put in there

376
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,920
I don't, you know, a DSC comment line or something like that

377
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
Just save it into your phone

378
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
And whenever you hear anything on the show

379
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,920
You can just pick up your phone and call right away and respond

380
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
You don't have to wait until your

381
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Back at home or back at the office or a near computer

382
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Or you don't have to send in a complete voice mail comment

383
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
You don't have to record anything with any

384
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Cast Blaster stuff you can just do it straight

385
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Straight from your phone

386
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
And we also have a number in London

387
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,920
2076813753

388
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,920
Dude, I left your message on the other

389
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Another number

390
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
And it's pretty quick, though

391
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,920
I just have to say that it's stopping at this cruncher's man

392
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,920
We just don't want to get shit on our hands later

393
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,920
Dude, I've never said I hated scrunchers

394
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
Some of my best friends are scrunchers

395
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Hi Adam, it's Neil Ford from the UK

396
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Just calling regarding the Gmail hack that you discussed on

397
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Or 33

398
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,920
The trick with adding the kind of sub email

399
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Is not so much that it will automatically get filtered into your spam

400
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,920
That's that you can actually write filters based on specific email addresses

401
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,920
So in your example that you could have a filter that added a label or whatever

402
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,920
But it also means that if you start to receive spam

403
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,920
And one of these sub addresses

404
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,920
You know who stole your email address

405
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Or where it's been

406
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Scratchful

407
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
So it's going to use it in that way

408
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,920
If you sign up for something and you put the class whatever in

409
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Then if you start to receive spam

410
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,920
You know that that site may very well have sold your address

411
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,920
In which case you may not wish to deal with the new future

412
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,920
So that's really what I think the previous comment was about

413
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,920
So I think that helps my view to find it a bit better

414
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,920
Take care, I'll end the scruncher

415
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Roger was waiting for it

416
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
Great Neil, thank you

417
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Yeah, no, I didn't do a very good job of explaining that I agree

418
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,920
I just think it's kind of cool that Gmail actually accepts the anything you

419
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,920
You can modify the email address and it still comes into your regular Gmail

420
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
I thought that was really the cool part about it

421
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
And of course from there you can set up filters or no

422
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Basically track back what's been happening with your email

423
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,920
But I tell you man, my email has been out there so long and so many places

424
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,920
That is published that I'll never ever get away from it at curry.com

425
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,920
So again out of it podshow.com

426
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,920
It's probably the most reliable place to get hold of me

427
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,920
I am still south here calling from some of the new places

428
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
Welcome back to the UK

429
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Thank you

430
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,920
I'll just listen to Charlie Thursday

431
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,920
August the third and you start up with Andrew Gold

432
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,920
It's wonderful and that's a lot of text on

433
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,920
And I just take out Andrew Gold has his own web podcast

434
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Did you know that?

435
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
No, I didn't know that

436
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
I subscribed to it, I don't know what it's like

437
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,920
But it says explicit on when you load into our changes

438
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920
It says explicit Andrew Gold

439
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Swears

440
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,920
It's nice

441
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Anyway, welcome back to have a good chat

442
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Folder scruncher, folder scruncher

443
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Folder scruncher, folder scruncher

444
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
Do not leave a voice mail comment

445
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
I'll let him know if you're a folder scruncher

446
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,920
Yeah, I gotta check that out Andrew Gold

447
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Explosive

448
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Sure, he's explicit

449
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Some of his little lyrics are, they know 50 cent lyrics

450
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,920
But he does have more than two songs you know

451
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Hi Adam, welcome back to the UK

452
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
This is an attack

453
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,920
Long term listener and owner of the award for the most perfect comment

454
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Thanks for that

455
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
That was very nice

456
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
I think you probably know I've worked in TV

457
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
I've done for many years in the UK

458
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,920
And it's interesting to hear you talking about top of the pot

459
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
On the show the other day

460
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
You know, the show the music has been going for

461
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
It's almost something years

462
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,920
And it's a bit of a world-wide phenomenon now

463
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,920
Because some of the pot is one of the main things that I've worked on in my empty past

464
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,920
And I remember in the 80s

465
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,920
We've talked about musicians and backing tracks that play live and songs

466
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,920
In the 80s when this whole thing came up

467
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
They had to sing live

468
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,920
The musicians you needed decided that backing tracks would have to be re-recorded as well

469
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,920
So there's the musicians who played on it

470
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
We'll also get paid

471
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,920
And the whole thing sort of didn't generate into a bit of a fast

472
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Because I remember one occasion I was this batch to the happy road studios

473
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,920
So I had a sense of a two-hour session with the holidays

474
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,920
So we're re-recording a re-release of

475
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,920
Getting heavy, my brother must have been sort of late 80s

476
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
I guess

477
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,920
And they played it through a few times

478
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,920
And the engineers ran a cool friend's tape on it

479
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,920
And the thought of the end of it

480
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,920
The right company were not in stood at all in having some crappy session

481
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,920
Without any chance of a remix going on TV

482
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,920
So for all of these to do was

483
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,920
I'll tell you in a bit of a bit of a column

484
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Because engineers just give me a different tape at the end of it

485
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,920
And remember on that occasion they gave me a tape

486
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
That was a different colour

487
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,920
On a different size spool

488
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
So the one on the grass is going round in the control room

489
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
So it was a little bit obvious

490
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,920
But that was why in the end

491
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,920
When the sun went out on top of the pots

492
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,920
The end was out sounding like the record

493
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Which is all of those companies are interested in the end anyway

494
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,920
So I'd like to share a little story with you

495
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,920
And also to say that this comment

496
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
Because I don't have my entire cast

497
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,920
Then you mentioned the wonderful, wonderful, regularised zones

498
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,920
By Lynn Parsons at Lynn Parsons.net

499
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
So I know it's on your favour

500
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
It's the regularised zone if a new show is doing

501
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,920
And I know you would absolutely adore it

502
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,920
Thanks again

503
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
Full disclosure

504
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
Full disclosure

505
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Full disclosure

506
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Full disclosure

507
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
Hey that's it

508
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
You know I should have talked about that yesterday

509
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,920
With Patricia when we were talking about top of the pop

510
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,920
So I do remember some some guys from the record label back in the

511
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,920
Whole

512
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Early early 80s actually telling me that exact story that I

513
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,920
You know it's not a problem at the top of the pop

514
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,920
We'll just go there and we'll sit in the studio

515
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,920
And record something we give the old original tape anyway

516
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,920
What a waste

517
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,920
English people should be up in arms

518
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Hundreds of thousands of pounds

519
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
Wasted on just sitting around the studio

520
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Pickin' their nose pretending to play

521
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,920
And just because of some stupid union rule that

522
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,920
At the time just made no sense

523
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,920
And it never was really adhered to

524
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Of course

525
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,920
Good story dude

526
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,920
And Lynn Parsons you better believe it

527
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
Yeah, I like her a lot

528
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,920
It's definitely check out her pod

529
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,920
She says she has two

530
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,920
I didn't I haven't heard about the new one yet

531
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,920
I'll check out the was it red light lounge

532
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
I'll check that out for sure

533
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
And I'm trying to hook up a meeting with Lynn

534
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,920
For some pod show UK stuff we're doing

535
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
I'll give you the next week of the week after next

536
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
So I'm looking forward to that

537
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,920
And please remember to end with

538
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Folder scruncher

539
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Just about at the end of today's daily source code

540
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,920
Wrapin' up the week

541
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,920
But of course, no week is complete

542
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
Come on

543
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,920
No week and certainly no Friday is complete

544
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Without hearing from the lawyer with a sense of humor

545
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,920
We know him as Jersey Todd

546
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,920
You're outer

547
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,920
I'd like to make a motion

548
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,920
To rock this mother out

549
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,920
You're on her, please don't bang that gavel

550
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,920
You can try this cowbell out

551
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Let's all give a nod

552
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,920
To the hardest work in the lawyer

553
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
He's Jersey Todd

554
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,920
And then he's Jersey Todd

555
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,920
Oh yeah

556
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,920
You're on her, what do you say?

557
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,920
He might even win this case

558
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Jersey Todd

559
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
Yeah, yeah

560
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,920
It was Jersey Todd

561
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,920
All of them

562
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,920
Jersey Todd

563
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,920
Shut up now

564
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
It's Jersey Todd

565
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,920
Oh yeah, you don't hate this type

566
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,920
Yo, what's up Adam?

567
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,920
Yo, for this Friday

568
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,920
I got one of the podcast icons for you

569
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,920
His name is Kevin Reeves

570
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
You know him, you love him

571
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
You played a song shine

572
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
You played a song mother

573
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
Well, he's back

574
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
He's back when the new song on the podcast

575
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
If music now

576
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
We're called Throw Me Align

577
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
But more importantly, his new album

578
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,920
It's all about time

579
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,920
It's finally out

580
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,920
And you can get your copy for ten bucks

581
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,920
I sent him to CD Baby last night

582
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,920
And I'm going to get mine too

583
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
So from the podcast

584
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
If music now work

585
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,920
This is the man Kevin Reeves

586
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,920
Check this out

587
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,920
I don't know

588
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,920
It's the sign of the time

589
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,920
For this year I'm going straight to take

590
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
I don't know

591
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,920
If I'm losing my mind

592
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,920
But I'm lost in the blind line of taste

593
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Is there any way I wanna hear

594
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,920
Is there some way to make this clearly?

595
00:47:50,920 --> 00:48:00,920
Because of you

596
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,920
I can't sleep anymore

597
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Since you walked out the door

598
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,920
And you left me

599
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,920
All I do

600
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,920
Is to stare at the wall

601
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,920
Thinkin' no thoughts at all

602
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,920
Except for memory

603
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,920
While you wanna drive me insane

604
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,920
But I ain't wanna kill me so much pain

605
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,920
But throw me alive

606
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,920
Because don't think I can't make it on my own

607
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Throw me alive

608
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,920
I pray that I've my die

609
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Even on the long road

610
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,920
So be silent

611
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,920
Tell me that you're still in the wind

612
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:55,920
I can't feel

613
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
I can't feel

614
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
Don't know darkness from light

615
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920
Don't know daytime from light

616
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,920
On this race end

617
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,920
Is it real

618
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Or will I wake up from this

619
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,920
And the mist of your tears

620
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,920
And embrace it

621
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,920
What the hell am I supposed to do

622
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
I don't think I can make it

623
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
Without you

624
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,920
But throw me alive

625
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,920
Because don't think I can't make it on my own

626
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,920
Throw me alive

627
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,920
I pray that I've my die

628
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Even on the long road

629
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,920
So be silent

630
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,920
Tell me that you're still in the wind

631
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,920
With me but throw me alive

632
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,920
I pray that I've my die

633
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,920
Even on the long road

634
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,920
I pray that I've my die

635
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,920
Even on the long road

636
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
So be silent

637
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,920
Tell me that you're still in the wind

638
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,920
I don't think I can make it without you

639
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,920
But throw me alive

640
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,920
I can't make it on my own

641
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Throw me alive

642
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,920
I pray that I've my die

643
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,920
Even on the long road

644
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,920
So be silent

645
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,920
Tell me that you're still in the wind

646
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,920
With me but throw me alive

647
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,920
I pray that I've my die

648
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,920
Even on the long road

649
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,920
So be silent

650
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,920
I pray that I've my die

651
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,920
Even on the long road

652
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,920
I pray that I've my die

653
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,920
Even on the long road

654
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,920
Give me one of these a month

655
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,920
I'll be a happy man for the rest of my life

656
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,920
Kevin Rave just throw me a line

657
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,920
Another song you can find on the Podsay music network

658
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,920
Kick and ass

659
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,920
And that's good

660
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,920
All right everybody

661
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,920
So I've given you lots of stuff to think about

662
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,920
To listen to and talk about over the weekend

663
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,920
Looking forward to see you back here on Monday

664
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,920
And by then I'll be rested

665
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
I'll be rested

666
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
A bit woozy

667
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,920
Woozy from the jet lag

668
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
We had all kinds of meetings and stuff that happened

669
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Just as usual Thursday morning yesterday

670
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
So we're kind of continued

671
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,920
Looking outside it's like typical

672
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,920
This is what you call British weather

673
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,920
It's not cold it's really nice actually

674
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,920
It's in the mid 70s

675
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,920
And you can see from miles and miles and miles

676
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,920
But not really there is a cloud base

677
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,920
There's the hot looking neighbor

678
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,920
We have a neighbor

679
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,920
And she's an aerobics instructor

680
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,920
And she has a hot red sports car

681
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,920
And Patricia's always baggin' on her

682
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,920
Oh man I wish Patricia were here

683
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,920
We could talk about her right now

684
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,920
Because she always has a belly shirts on

685
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,920
Let's see

686
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,920
She's just pulled up into the drive

687
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,920
And her little red sports car

688
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,920
Let me see what she's wearing

689
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
Oh man Patricia would be laughing

690
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,920
She would be laughing if she were here

691
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
Hold on

692
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
Come on

693
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,920
Get out of your car

694
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,920
She's divorced

695
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
I should have mentioned that too

696
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,920
She's divorced and lives there with her daughter

697
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,920
I think her daughter is maybe five or six

698
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
I can't see she's getting out of the...

699
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Oh there we go

700
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Hmm she died her hair

701
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,920
It's lighter

702
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Now let's see what is she wearing

703
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,920
I guess

704
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,920
Her aerobics outfit

705
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,920
No it's the long white pants

706
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,920
With a...

707
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,920
It looks like a string tank top

708
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,920
Hmm

709
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,920
It takes so little to make an old man happy

710
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,920
Hey everybody I'll talk to you on Monday

711
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
Take care everybody

712
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,920
Another pot show pot cast

713
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Stick it in your ear

714
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,920
Get this pot cast

715
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,920
And we're great ones like it

716
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,920
On the high performance pot cast

717
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,920
Delivery network from Podjo

718
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
And line white networks

719
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,920
I love it
