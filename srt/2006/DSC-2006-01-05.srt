Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience. Victoria

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,680
Hold $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,180
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

22
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:23,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

23
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:53,180
yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, how you had yourä¹Ÿ now, oh, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah like yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

24
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,100
Music of people creating music and we got some great really well-played tracks and the sound is decent

25
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,700
You know, and messed around actually I gave it the AKG microphone to plug it instead of the one that came with it

26
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,580
And so I was kind of planning on doing a sound seeing tour

27
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,420
We're not for two things first. So I've always been way too much time fooling around second of all

28
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,220
I only have two nine-volt batteries and I need in order to do the sound seeing tour

29
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,300
I need two of them for the wireless transmitter and receiver and one of those nine volts was now in the

30
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,260
AKG microphone because it needs to fan some power now that you give a shit, but I you know

31
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,020
Anyway, it's soon to come and of course that will be completely non-pod safe

32
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,140
Let's see we got some interesting bits of feedback today

33
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,140
I good buddy

34
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,780
Roger Smalls going to show up again with an audio comment that he sent in and

35
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,260
I think we'll squeeze in a bit of a metro sexual moment

36
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Joe McLaughlin

37
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,540
sent me a link to an article about billboard magazine

38
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:01,460
I have to be honest that I didn't really read the whole article, but his comment caught my eye and a new I could comment on it no matter what he says

39
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,020
I bet

40
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Pods sake music network and podcasting itself was sold more music than Starbucks last I checked the only reason I went there was to use the Wi-Fi to download podcasts and get a cup of chino

41
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,740
Well, it's a widely known fact in the music business that Starbucks puts the music business to

42
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,220
Shame when it comes to selling CDs. They move an incredible amount of product and you know what they're doing basically is

43
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:29,860
They're putting together compilation CDs stuff that really you know if they know their audience and it is really moving an amazing amount of product

44
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,980
Which just goes to show you know if if a coffee chain and as you put it a Wi-Fi chain and coffee chain

45
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,900
Can do a better job at selling music than the record companies? Well, there you go

46
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,100
And see the one day have any updates on the positive music network actually we're looking for another developer

47
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
For the with some specific skills

48
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,060
For the positive music network. So if if you're so inclined and you live in the Bay Area

49
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,380
Give me a shout because we're we're looking for someone to do some work with us on the APIs for the purchasing system

50
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,740
That we're putting into place

51
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,380
So all of that is coming up and we got lots of talk about

52
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,740
I'm gonna switch two things here. I was gonna do

53
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,820
Something about viral marketing. I want them to do is I'm gonna switch it around. I want you to hear this comment from Roger Smalls

54
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,580
Because he's he's not going through my trash anymore. I think he got the message there, but

55
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Well listen in for side

56
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,260
Hello, I'm Roger here. I had on the telly sauce coat. There was a problem with any of the companies

57
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,620
You recommended then you'll listen as she let you know

58
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,220
Now as you mentioned that you visit Guildford's branch should the same species market

59
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:45,140
So I've started shopping there. They solely on your recommendation and this day it's very good quality food and so

60
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:52,820
It and I didn't pop by there since I'm seeing now don't actually find anything because you said you like it in there so much

61
00:07:52,820 --> 00:08:01,380
But I do have a minor complaints. I'd like to draw your attention. So I've noticed that the carry-backs break very easily when you put a lot of groceries in them

62
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
Maybe you could pop down there

63
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,620
That's what words with magic. I'm sure now that you are straight away

64
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:13,060
That's I could give out to carry-backs for heavy items. You know, I just just read the love a little bit. I'm not sure

65
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,260
Oh, and then what I'm calling I thought I'd mention your idea of getting a tattoo

66
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,460
I don't think you realize the body parts do tens change shape of the years

67
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,380
I worked with this woman who has a suit just above

68
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:37,620
She started off with a lovely tattoo of her me, but hovering over a cuff where it ended up looking like a totally trash in a fishing net because of all the ways that she

69
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,540
For some maybe just gave some more saying tattoos on you with the

70
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,900
Because that is not not a tissue of Christina

71
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,380
And maybe just a lucky listener could get their name mentioned on your body

72
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Anyway, how do you know you're at them?

73
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,380
Okay Roger how about if I get Roger tattooed will that make you happy?

74
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
He's right actually the

75
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:09,060
The bags that they give you it's saying's bury here in guilt for to carry your groceries home and you really need to double bag of me because they're really not so that's strong

76
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,700
Which kind of freak it's kind of weirding me out a little bit because I've actually been

77
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,700
People have approached me in saying's bury a more than one occasion said hey excuse me

78
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Are you Adam Curry

79
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,820
Because you know they'll see me with the leather jacket with the with the with the hair waving around from side to side

80
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,260
And

81
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,620
You know they see me hammering out shit on my blackberry they see Patricia so they put it all together kind of and I

82
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,380
Wonder if Roger was one of those people who introduced themselves to me at saying's worries

83
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,340
Anyway, happy new year to your Roger. It's a pleasure to have you

84
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Listen to the show as always

85
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,500
One more day for this week and then as you know Sunday, I'm off to San Francisco and then we're going to really be heads down

86
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,460
We may even go to Atlanta a week later

87
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,900
So what would that be? I'll be some around the 16th I think

88
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,020
To go to talk to a company there now. What's in Atlanta you say?

89
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Hey Adam Bob from the Bob show

90
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,740
I keep me need to record that thing but I never do

91
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,740
Part of the problem is that I listen to you doing what you do and go. Yeah, that's what I'd like to do and fuck he's doing it better

92
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,900
And I can so I just listen to you and keep thinking about making my own

93
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,500
Wanted to weigh in if I could unto the topics that have been coming up on a regular basis all right on the

94
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:36,020
DSE and that's the future of advertising in the sense sale. Yeah, I got to tell you Adam the future of advertising is this

95
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,900
Yeah, this me talking to you right now

96
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,420
You're getting feedback from actual users we can try to reformat the 30 second spot

97
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,900
But you know they've been doing that for a long time. I mean back in the days of red skeleton they had 30 second spots

98
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,860
The difference is we're not trying to put a jingle or a comedic piece together and fit it into a little piece of time

99
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,980
With an a larger piece of time in which we try to sell someone to some a shite

100
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:10,420
We felt through that shit out man when we've trained ourselves we know we've got so much time spot comes on we start thinking about

101
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:16,500
What's for dinner or not what you're trying to sell me because I know you're trying to sell it to me. It's like that's really funny

102
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,740
You say that I just want to jump in for one second

103
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,340
John Bon Jovi once told me that when they were the top of their game in

104
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,420
And I guess it was the early 90s late 80s early nine days

105
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,140
He'd actually be on stage playing singing and thinking about a meeting with his accountant

106
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,100
You know about his car about his playing that it was really not pleasurable

107
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,420
Okay, let's continue. It's like when you see the guy walking up your driveway

108
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,580
Get ready to knock on your door with the big old pharbess the big briefcase in his hand

109
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,060
You know he's gonna sell you something so you pretend like you're not home or you're nicely sent him on his way

110
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
That's what we mentally do with advertising

111
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,020
Now segue to send sail

112
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,860
Here's a product that you like and you talk about on a regular basis

113
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,580
Dude

114
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,660
My wife wants an eye dog. She's gonna get one. I have an MM50

115
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,940
Or whatever they're calling that now based on your recommendation and I got a send sail now

116
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,580
I got one minute. I wasn't gonna get one. I went to give value

117
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:18,020
They've got a pod based coffee maker and I ordered it because if I order their coffee on a regular basis

118
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,380
They give it to me for free

119
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,980
But I kept hearing you talk about yours and it sounded different

120
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,900
So when you were angry at them even an anger atom you sell since they are or their products anyway

121
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,340
You were pissed off because they were giving away send sales

122
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,100
So of course I had to go get me a free send say I took a picture it took me about 10 minutes of my old coffee pots

123
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,180
Send it to him. They sent me a nice red to send sail machine didn't know it came in that color, but it looks

124
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,220
Pretty good and I put in my medium roast. Do we eggbirds coffee and damn? That's good stuff in it

125
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:56,980
Love the foam it comes out just right. I don't waste coffee like I used to make it a whole pot when I'm the only one who drinks it

126
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,460
And it's good coffee now recently

127
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,500
In answer to something someone said on your show about

128
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,340
Send sail or whoever owns them being an evil conglomerate

129
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,820
No, they're they're not an evil conglomerate. They're a business not a charity

130
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,620
So they want to make money so by the pods if you like the coffee and if you don't want to buy their coffee

131
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,420
See this how I couldn't find any reason. Yeah, what on Amazon did a search for send sale?

132
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,780
I was looking for some coffee pots because I couldn't find them locally and

133
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,460
You know, they have when I ordered them, but they also had this thing that was called an

134
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,380
Environmental friendly refillable pod now. I don't know what the

135
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:40,020
Environmental friendly thing is it's plastic, man, but if you get it you can put whatever you want in there

136
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,540
So that means you could go down to your favorite specialty shop buy

137
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:51,380
By sir making blue mountains right at yourself put it in there and I bet you that'd be pretty good and the things are like nine dollars

138
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,500
So if you're out to save money or bust up the monopoly. I guess that'd be a way to do it

139
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:04,100
Well, I think that's exactly what's happening. We're and and a lot of these advertisers that we're talking to

140
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:10,100
We're working on doing campaigns like this the eye dog was actually where we kind of stumbled upon it when

141
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,140
You know the the concept of having user generated

142
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,580
Advertisements makes a lot of sense to me particularly if if I'm

143
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,100
Promoting a product talking about a product we're having a essentially we're having a conversation about a product when you send

144
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,460
Audio feedback back back my way if you if you like it if you purchase it if you don't even

145
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,980
I mean that of course is the is the tricky part is to put the good in the bad in there

146
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,180
Which you've actually done on now on more than one occasion with with with sponsors on this show

147
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,340
What I like though the thing that I like hearing the most is no one has said I hate advertisements

148
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,900
People said I don't like advertisements this particular way that's really exciting to me

149
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,780
And maybe if you purchase the product maybe you shouldn't hear the advertisement. I don't know

150
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,380
That's a so much stuff to work on there really is but we're getting somewhere and you know luckily we have

151
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,660
People on the other side of the equation who were willing to work with us and come up with some of some of these interesting

152
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,180
Concepts I had another

153
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,300
Great brain wave the other day and I think that what you're going to see is as we start

154
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,020
Campaigning to bring in more listeners right now. We're getting everything set up for the podcast

155
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,660
But simultaneously we're getting it set up for listeners because

156
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,980
Listeners are podcasts are some vice versa

157
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,460
The concept of a registered listener. I think is going to be very important

158
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,700
So that's not just a subscriber someone who actually gets the show through your

159
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,980
RSS feed but a registered listener who you can reach out to and they can reach out back to you through multiple forms of media

160
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
I think that's where we're going to see a lot of excitement

161
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,380
You know, hey, maybe if I said hey if you're registered listener

162
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,380
To the daily source code, which means we have some way of communicating with each other and I'm not talking just about email

163
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
That would be pretty fucking lame

164
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,820
But maybe you'd like to have a a Gillette M3 power sent to your home to to try it out

165
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,860
Wouldn't that be interesting that they listen companies do that all the time?

166
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:10,980
So that has stuff to think about so much stuff to do. I can't wait to get the San Francisco one one stuff is up and running and rolling

167
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,380
That's when you can really start to play you know then it's like you can think up

168
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,540
And I know I can think of 15 new

169
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,580
Features and cool things that we'll make the whole experience better. I can do it a day. It's oh

170
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,860
Yes, very excited here in the country

171
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,260
I need that I'm hi Johnny it's Steve Williams a podcaster from the 21st century

172
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,500
I just wanted to give you the skinny on Cindy Snops tell a pod my weekly podcast every week

173
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:50,020
I tell a pod through the time space continuum and discover motion pictures that have somehow slipped outside the cinematic mainstream

174
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,580
Cycle beach party the big empty million dollar hotel the monkeys mask and welcome to woop look

175
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,780
You know the really great but overlooked films that the white poloi weren't exposed to now

176
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:08,500
I'm waiting I'm glad Johnny as I said Cindy Snops tell a pod is a weekly podcast that can be found as

177
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Cindysnop.com that's c-i-n-e-s-n-o-b dot com and if you happen to run into bogey or Anne Sheridan

178
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
Would you please let them know too?

179
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Thank you Johnny

180
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,940
And welcome to the Mac of Zerers Mac eat get it's day and John hi up in the macum server towers

181
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,380
I had no idea to success it yeah be aware of it while it's a very cool feature they have yes

182
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,340
And I've come across it when I've been looking at fast backwards. No, I wouldn't recommend anyone try to beat it

183
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,660
I'm not gonna try and beat it. We got some feedback

184
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,580
My name you show the great idea actually I learn if you have any stories you'd like to share with us

185
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,500
Not even gonna go mad. It's got mad skills, baby, and don't forget folks next week is macro

186
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:10,580
John and I'll be podcasting live from the show floor on Tuesday afternoon talking about the keynote and what we saw there

187
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,500
And then we'll be podcasting from the hotel in a couple times after that and hey Adam if you want tickets to our rock and

188

Cirque du Mac party with the Mac world all star band on Wednesday night hunt me down and let me know

189
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,460
Does it make you get dot com

190
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,740
That's right man's big big good who'd manny going on in San Francisco

191
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
Which I'm just gonna catch the tail end of

192
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
um and of course

193
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,460
Monday the ninth Howard Stern starts on on serious. I'm gonna be in San Francisco and I'll be able to get up nice and early

194
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,180
And I've got my serious satellite receiver. It's gonna be very exciting

195
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,820
Let's pose and buddy mind we email back and forth and keep each other up to date on stuff sent me

196
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:56,580
a very interesting link if if you want to get involved in podcasting and and I think I actually see a whole business here for this stuff

197
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
Certainly if it catches on

198
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,420
Ain't you know you don't necessarily want to create a podcast me want to contribute and and unfortunately

199
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,300
You have to have a Macintosh and at this moment in time

200
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,980
He sent me a link to something called iStarcomposer at uh scriptsoftware.com

201
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:23,060
I'll just read from the synopsis. iStarcomposer creates synchronized lyrics on the Mac to export to the iPod and iTunes

202
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,940
iStarcomposer finds lyrics but more importantly allows you to sink them to a song and then allows you to

203
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,660
Export the synchronized lyrics into new music file, which is AAC that will play and display and iTunes and on the iPod

204
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:41,140
Okay, so there's another feature though. It'll actually allow you to put time code based show notes

205
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,100
Into the file now it's gonna output an AAC file so it will only work in

206
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,500
Programs that recognize that so quick time of course and iTunes

207
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,980
But here's here's a suggestion I could make you know

208
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,060
And most people don't catch this show on the day that it's actually created it's probably a day later

209
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,460
Lots of people play catch up so I don't think and I really don't think the day matters that much, you know

210
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,860
That's the whole point doesn't matter when I make this show it's just the next show it's the most recent one

211
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,460
Don't listen to the show if you ever want to know if they find a sound of been laden, okay wrong show to listen to wrong medium

212
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:24,420
But wouldn't it be cool if the day after a show when the the show notes the wiki show notes have been completely populated

213
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:32,100
If someone then and here's where the opportunity lies of course if someone would take those show notes and synchronize them using this tool

214
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
synchronize them into

215
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,820
Into the file into a new AAC file, which of course we could make completely

216
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Subscriber bulls so you'd be able to

217
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,420
Subscribe to the the extra bonus show note file and

218
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,980
I mean I would have some benefit I guess would be kind of cool

219
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,300
It would be enhanced as well

220
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,540
So when you hit a spot in the

221
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,820
In the show where it talks about or perhaps when I play a song, you know, then there will be a picture there of some album art

222
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,380
Of course you can't really link anywhere, which makes it a little bit unfortunate

223
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,860
But it could be cool you could even put the listener comments in there

224
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,020
So

225
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,900
Just a thought just a thought it's a way that that you could get into doing something interesting with podcasting

226
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,700
I know I certainly don't have the time for that to be sure

227
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,780
Uh

228
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,020
Oh my goodness, so we have like three minutes left on the on the satellite window

229
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,540
Which is not gonna be enough we might as well get it started

230
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
That's right

231
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,260
This is the spot where we all gather around his guys and talk about

232
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,860
Gurly type stuff Steve Harris says hey Adam talking about moisturizer and smaller containers being better

233
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,220
Here's a good one I've been using since summer nivia for men intensive moisture cream

234
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,620
Yeah, I've used that one myself actually comes in a tiny pot

235
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,260
So you don't need to use much and because it's for men

236
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,780
You don't smell like a girl or feel silly at the checkout that lots of moisturizers out there for guys these days

237
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,540
It would be good to know what others are using happy new year Steve from reinvented software

238
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I really feel proud doing this, you know, I just point it now that I feel

239
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Something really good where we're up to here

240
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,620
Let's see

241
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,820
Hey Adam says mark bars another listener to me that you don't use an electric razor

242
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,140
You're the gadget man. Well, I always use my fill of shave and it works fine, but honestly

243
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,900
I think manually shaving will be smoother, but then I'm lazy and always

244
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,580
Inner hurry

245
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,460
Nivia started a couple years ago here to again with their four men product line and tried some of the product my favorite one is

246
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,140
The Q10 cream. I'll see you use the off-brands they work as well

247
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,020
They make my face feel nice and soft all day it's supposed to give your skin energy when you missed a couple hours of sleep

248
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,620
But I use a daily and it feels a lot better compared to the other moisturizers. I've tried

249
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,340
I combine that with a weekly facial mask. Oh, we haven't even gotten the facial mask

250
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,820
I tried the four men facial masks

251
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,980
You know mark your Shimodo nemcoff of the Pacific Coast hell. I always wanted to give me a facial mask and

252
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,020
Just so glad we haven't shared that yet

253
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:19,700
Anyway, Mark doesn't think they're all that good. So yes, I go into my girlfriend stuff and use a cheap off-brand facial mask

254
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,340
It really makes my skin look softer and nicer just want to share this Metro sexual experience

255
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,260
This is fantastic. See I have one more here Kevin Flanagan nevermind the Metro sexual bid

256
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,660
I haven't used a razor, but a few times since 1980 and that really makes the blades last

257
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,140
I used one two times in the first half of the eighties each time I decided to grow the beard back

258
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,180
The very next day. I used a razor one time in the 90s to trim my neck from my wedding day. That's it

259
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,740
I never cut myself shaving never give dollars to Gillette Wilkinson or whomever. I think it's better than shaving besides I'm lazy

260
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,380
And I will tell you from my own Metro sexual momentary experiential

261
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:05,620
Testing I think I've gotten the hang of the M3 power razor. This is the the vibrating razor from Gillette

262
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:12,180
Have not gotten to replacement blade. Yes, so I don't know if if the blades which are different on the outside

263
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:19,220
If that's gonna make any difference when I use those, but I've learned that really have to take slower strokes to make it work

264
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:26,100
And I had it today. My first shave that I really enjoyed and if you'd like to know more about the Metro sexual moment

265
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,740
And you're listening to serious stars one or three tune in tomorrow. We got to say goodbye to you for now

266
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,300
All right, we can just continue here. There was actually an audio comment that came in for the Metro sexual moment

267
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,540
And you know, I'm always looking for more audio comments. So I'm gonna open it up here. Here we go

268
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
I think

269
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
Oh, man, what is this? It's like

270
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,420
Volume and zero. I totally suck so I can boost this up a bit

271
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,660
Audio settings go volume up to full

272
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,700
Can't believe that

273
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,860
Audio's okay. I'll pull this one all the way down

274
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,020
Okay, I can't make that one much softer. Let's see if we can get it now

275
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,300
Come on

276
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,100
High-given sort of podcast and they just wanted to

277
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,460
Step in and talk a little bit about your Metro sexual

278
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,980
segment that you do on your on the daily source code

279
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,580
I do shave part of my face. I should say my neck

280
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,380
I do wear full beard

281
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,620
I also shave my head and for both of these I use each of that mock three turbo

282
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Is the best item that I've found for this

283
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
I don't use your traditional

284
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Laddering shaving creams

285
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,140
For the most part I use stuff that I got off of headplay dot com

286
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,500
This is a site that is for men who shave their heads

287
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,620
It is

288
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,100
They have a shaving device it works wonderful

289
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,380
I do believe they need to update their blade system null. They need to at least get a three blade system and

290
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,060
Right now they'll have a two blade system

291
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:22,580
But they do have some shaving cream and a moisturizer that I use and I think it is in

292
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,380
Redouble one and I plan on

293
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,420
Continuing to use it and I continue to tell people that shave their heads all about them

294
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
Very good site and very good product and

295
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,860
I think everybody ought to check it out

296
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,300
But then once again, this is

297
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
AJ from the high-given sort of podcast

298
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,380
Have a good day

299
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,620
Yo AJ fantastic man. Thank you very much. Let me just read just the levels here

300
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,780
Okay, there we go. That's better

301
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,540
Yeah, I didn't even thought about that. Of course, there's lots of guys who feed into our metro sexual category who shave their heads

302
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,540
Damn

303
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,940
Okay, well, I can't really participate in the in the whole discussion, but I'm more than happy to

304
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,740
To facilitate it. Okay last one for the metro sexual moment for today

305
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
This is from

306
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,300
The hell is this from

307
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,300
our careless

308
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,660
Doesn't say who is from three things I'd like to fill in

309
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,940
I'm a mechanical engineer specializing materials in manufacturing also pursuing side interest in chemistry

310
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,380
To test blades simply hit one with the other taking a pack in blade and replacement blade

311
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,780
Bang the cutting I just together of course you'll have to cut away any plastic guards and shells by definition

312
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,780
The weaker blade will be dulled by the sharper blade

313
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,300
There's some natural variation from blade to blade so you'll have to take a bunch of originals and a bunch of refills

314
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,340
Log the results and do some averaging man, sounds like a lot of work now. Oh, so I do know fewer than five hits

315
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,340
Not including any trial runs. Oh, okay, so I was I was like I do a lot more hits than that

316
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,380
Okay, no more than five hits not including any trial runs needed to get the hang of it

317
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,060
A truly definitive test

318
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,780
Might need hundreds of blades brought from different stores at different times. What did you're bombing the out, man?

319
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,780
All right, that's it for this stuff for this week

320
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,580
Yeah, all right, baby, man, that always makes me tired that Metro sexual stuff

321
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,540
Let's see what are we into how many yeah? I've got a couple of different pieces of feedback here

322
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,220
But you know they're both about Senseo and I really don't I really don't want to do that right now

323
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
What should we do I've got

324
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,580
now

325
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Can you hear the birds outside

326
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
Which turn it up I can hear a home in my mic

327
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,940
The sun just started shining a little bit and the birds just came alive

328
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,460
Now, I have enough sense say of stuff for today. Well, let me just scroll down

329
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
I did want to mention that

330
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,180
Business week has a podcast had their green host that she's had myself on she's had Ron on before and now she had

331
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,620
I forget if it was the president of

332
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,380
Interactive for CBS for CBS television

333
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
But very interesting to listen to

334
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,660
Listen to what the the quote mainstream industries thoughts are right now on

335
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
on podcasting both

336
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,220
From a audio and visual standpoint and

337
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,540
The way they the way they operate he even talks about you know how how really how it works

338
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:33,620
What contracts are needed at what stage of transactions and who owns what and it's really it's pretty fascinating stuff

339
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,060
So I suggest you listen to that and I want to leave you I guess with just

340
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,500
One more song from the just gotta upload it to the podcast music network. It's the bitty's live

341
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:20,180
In my head of my five speed. Oh, we'll drive that man cherry red love

342
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Well, we want to be famous

343
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
New York

344
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:43,460
Well, if I imagine we're getting out of the city and go to where it's pretty by the

345
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:49,060
Graces of my truck like Charlotte when I have my truck. I believe I have the dinners

346
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:55,780
The robbers and the wonders by the increases of my truck. A dream is always

347
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
You live

348
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,140
That comes from your very song

349
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,020
In dream

350
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:20,260
There are no stuff like that all and every one is beautiful

351
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Oh

352
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,140
One more in my truck

353
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,740
We never have to worry because we're never in hurry when we're driving in my trucks

354
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
And we're in my truck

355
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,420
There's no such thing as my vehicles the only ways the highways

356
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
Straight to heaven in my truck

357
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,420
Oh

358
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,700
Love

359
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,700
We want

360
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,220
They must

361
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
New York

362
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
I guess

363
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,220
Just more

364
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,220
Be it's all lucky

365
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,420
Well, we want

366
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,340
They must

367
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,100
New York

368
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,780
Just me

369
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,260
My honey and my truck

370
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,420
That's what I knew man. I need a bitties karaoke DVD

371
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,140
I give it up now girls doesn't she seem like an angelly and a fantastic love them

372
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,540
That's from there with the evening at the muse in Charlotte to North Carolina

373
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:41,460
The bitties in my truck and that actually reminded me that I thank you very much for all the different people who sent in

374
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:48,500
Links to video files and and torrent files of the discovery show dirty jobs where the host actually

375
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
Went through the entire process of getting

376
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,780
Used oil from a Mexican restaurant taking it back to

377
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,820
Some guys biodiesel manufacturing plant in his garage

378
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,500
All the way through to filling up the pickup truck with it and it really got my brain moving

379
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,660
I mean, if you look at the cost of the equipment, which I think is about five

380
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,580
Hundred bucks something like that to have a full set up to really to be able to supply yourself with your own

381
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,140
House with heating oil

382
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,380
And your car

383
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,380
Probably at a monthly basis

384
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,380
You know you're looking at maybe

385
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,300
What did they say I think that with the depreciation of the gear that they he was looking at 50 cents a gallon

386
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,220
So obviously if you didn't have to depreciate the gear

387
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:41,380
Then you'd be making your stuff pretty cheap. I was thinking you know, wow, this is it's so beautiful

388
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,380
We could like put together

389
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,540
Almost like a corporation actually could be a corporation. You know Bay Area biodiesel

390
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Baby co there you go

391
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,180
Babe co babe co that's even better babe co be a yb

392
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,620
CO babe co

393
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
Yeah, and

394
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,660
It would only take two people really to run a full-time

395
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,100
Operation one guy picks up while the other guy is

396
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,860
You know is it's clean and shit out. I don't know and then they make the biodiesel or someone else man's the pump

397
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,980
Throughed we could totally do it and I wonder what the with the regulations are

398
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,180
Environmental regulations for just opening up a gas station

399
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,820
But it seems it's like it's very very doable and

400
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,500
You know it's just how many restaurants do you have in your neighborhood that use

401
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:38,980
a deep fryer probably every single one has it and they probably clean it out at least once but more likely two to three times a week

402
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:48,980
Fascinating we could build a company. I'd gladly fund if we we'd like franchise if someone could come up with the design specs and and we could actually create

403
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,620
Create the refinery part portion of it which is really cool and it's relatively simple but it does take some time

404
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:01,300
You know does take some work to come up with a you know a good oil drum full of

405
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,340
Biodiesel but you can pour this stuff straight into any diesel car

406
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,980
Okay

407
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:16,340
Now of course results may vary due to road and weather conditions and but even the newer diesel should not have a problem burning this stuff

408
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,500
These you can get a hold of that a copy of that of course. I can't post it online

409
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Of dirty jobs the biodiesel

410
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,180
Edition it's one of the segments on the show from Discovery Channel or if you can see it

411
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,940
If it's gonna come up again on TV definitely take a look at it because you'll see

412
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,540
How cool it is and besides it having environmental benefits

413
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,100
It's independence man that's what really what I like about it just independence from the man

414
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,460
All right everybody I'm gonna get out here tomorrow the thank god. It's Friday edition of the show

415
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,700
Maybe some karaoke I will see certainly I'll start with another

416
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,020
Motivational quote of the day so take care y'all bye bye

417
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,180
Another pod show podcast stick it in your ear
