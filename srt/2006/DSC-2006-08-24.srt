Swordle?

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can't believe it.

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't believe it.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't believe it.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't believe it.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't believe it

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think I'm about to over time, I go crazy and I don't know why and I can't believe

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And I could try to give you all but it's no use, no, I don't know, I can't believe

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And I could try to give you all but it's no use, no, I don't know why and I don't know why

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I could try to give you all but it's no use, no, I don't know, I can't believe

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And I could try to give you all but it's no use, no, I don't know why

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I could try to give you all but it's no, I don't know, I can't believe

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And I could try to give you all but it's no, I don't know, I can't believe

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not quite sure who she is but paper Rogers sounds even better with cowbell

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Actually

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Excuse me, how are you doing everybody?

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Paper Rogers played that from the pod save music that we can't believe

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Just added to the PMN link in the show notes at dailysourceco.com

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She's from the UK, interesting, it's from the bio growing up in a music loving family

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Paper was surrounded by a range of musical influences hearing everything from the Beatles to the incredible string band to Pink Floyd

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But it was always the strong female voice that caught her attention, well indeed

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey everybody, it's the dailysourceco coming to you from Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Guildford

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Great show lined up for you all kinds of cool stuff you guys have sent in to share

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And you know when you come to class, we want you to share it in my ever ending quest

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My never ending, I never ending quest

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
To maintain the 42 year old gloody as maximum as known as my ass

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
As you know, Amy Mac of the fitness attack podcast has been kind enough to keep me in check with yet another assercise

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Amy Mac, do it for me

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Save Adam's ass

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey Adam, it's Amy Mac

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Who you made it to week four

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Last week was a little complicated, so I decided to do an easy one this week

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You will need a wall though

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, hold on a second, let me

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Alright, you're back against the wall

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Feed out in front of you

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Feed out in front of you

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now you're gonna slide down the wall until your knees are at a 90 degree angle

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This means that your knees cannot come over your toes

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So adjust those feet out away from the wall accordingly

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Great, now hold it

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
How much longer?

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You should feel it in your legs and butt

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Make sure your arms are either at your side or straight out in front of you

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You cannot use them to help hold you up

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, that was 20 seconds, now come back up

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Deep breaths and slide down again

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Again

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Make sure your feet are out far enough

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, look a bit hurting

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
On the other side

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I have to wait

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How long?

Alright Adam, you'll slide back up

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, I see this week wasn't so bad

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That went pretty quick

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Until next time

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh Amy, thank you

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Mr. Amy, can you hurt me some more please

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I felt it wasn't so much of my asses

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It was right by my knees

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh man, they got hot

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh man

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Assercise

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We should do this as we should spin this off and do a separate show Amy

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I hope you're doing that

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't we do we have an acercise.potshow.com

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We need it

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, I always need to

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Take a deep breath

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Cranky

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have absolutely no condition

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yesterday, Patricia, now we're talking

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
As we were talking actually in the show yesterday

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A KLM aircraft returned

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It was on its way to Mumbai

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And over Germany decided to return to Skipple Airport in Amsterdam

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And it was very unclear as to exactly what was going on

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, today I, of course, scanned all the new stories

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, so on breath

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This is embarrassing

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So I scanned all the new stories today

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Apparently, now this was a flight to India

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So I guess you can imagine

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There could have been all kinds of people

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Who might have looked like terrorists on that flight

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now this is from I witness accounts

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And I'm just translating stuff directly from Dutch

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Cause I haven't seen any of these reports

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Translated in English anywhere yet

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If I do, I'll put it in the show notes

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Of course, they will source code.com

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So they were about to 12 passengers

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Who after take off were playing around with cell phones

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Passing them back and forth

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And people got really worried

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Apparently, there were also three U.S. mind

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You, sky marshals onboard the flight

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And so it's a little unclear to exactly what happened

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But the sky marshals basically took over

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Command of the cabin

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
From the flight attendants

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And at that point, I presume that they told the cockpit

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They should, at the pilot and copilot

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Should return back to Schipel Airport

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now, no sooner had this hit the news wires

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Then I started to receive all kinds of interesting audio

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In fact, I have here the audio of flight northwest 42

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Talking to Schipel Tower about returning

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And you'll hear some very distinct words in here

191
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
As Dutch military starts talking to the F-16 fighter jets

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Talking about a scramble A or A scramble

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Or scramble Deg

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Anyway, listen to this

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll translate along with you

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll translate along with you

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Do that to 6-0, I'll send it to 7-0

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay, so that's just regular traffic

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We'll see what's coming now

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay, so that's the captain of the flight northwest 42

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Saying you want to touch down around 30 minutes past the hour

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, so what he said there is there still

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Working on an escort once that they have landed and are going to be taxing

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And he was going to get back to the pilot with more information

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you very much

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hello, sir

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Good morning sir

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The reporter told you are requesting whether you would like any

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Flyer departments on the runway

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I know sir

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, so in case you couldn't hear that

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The authorities were requesting if northwest 42 wanted any

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Fire department or any other kind of facilities on the runway

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
one way you heard the answer, no sir.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Nice, that was derivative about.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now, now we go to Dutch military.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay, so I don't think there was an actual scramble of airplanes on the ground.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think that they might have actually been in the air if I'm hearing this.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It sounds like she's already giving them flight level instructions.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Or she's giving them flight level instructions for when they scramble.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay, so they were already in the air and she's giving them instructions on where to intercept the north-west airlines.

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Was it DC-10? Yeah, I think it was DC-10.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay, so no, so that's where she's telling me exactly where to find the aircraft.

224
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Any get to speak to sub-point-five?

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We came in from the east, possibly a quenter, and now to flying overhead, I shall be at left-back seat.

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Right, and so then they had to drop carousine, etc.

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So it was kind of cool to hear that. It came in so fast.

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I was actually thinking of posting the audio yesterday, but I was like,

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, obviously for the daily source code.

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We probably would have known what would have happened.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So I guess it sounds like there apparently there are 12 people in custody.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But I don't know if this, you know, people play with cell phones all the time.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The heck knows what's going on.

234
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Scotch on the rocks presents Whitney Steel Live of Lance.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What do you think you know me?

236
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sunlight told me I'd be a lady.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We need joins Lance and studio again to share her new news.

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It can take your calls.

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Whenever new, except for me and you,

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you said no one ever will, and told me not to tell.

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Call in and talk to Whitney Live, Saturday, August 26, 6 p.m. Pacific Time.

242

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Go to Scotch-dashrock.com for more information.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Whitney Steel Live in studio Saturday, August 26, 6 p.m. Pacific Time.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What are the websites, Scotch-dashrocks for more information on Whitney Steel Live?

246
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't know about the name Steel.

247
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It sounds like such a radio-chick name, you know?

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's always Whitney Steel.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We days on Z-100.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Janet Steel, overnight's.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
She's the record love goddess.

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
She's Whitney Steel.

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Now, check my Scotch-dashrocks.

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I cannot believe the feedback I'm getting about this.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's become an official controversy about me jokingly or not.

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Apparently asking for naked pictures from Carmen Tyler.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You've probably heard E-Band checking yesterday saying that I was going to go,

258
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I was not going to pass past go.

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I was going straight to hell over doing this.

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And you know, and Patricia and I joked about it.

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I know E-Band was joking too.

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But now people are starting to take this pretty serious.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Seriously?

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Pretty seriously.

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Kevin Reeves, who I've played many times on this podcast,

266
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
checks in in the debate.

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Hey, Adam, how are we going?

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is Kevin Reeves from Nashville.

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I just wanted to continue some dialogue here regarding the naked pictures

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and Carmen Tyler.

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know, the guy that sent that message in today was being funny.

272
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And you know, said some things.

273
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You know, regarding three things with Amy Grant, which.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, well, you know, we didn't even dwell on that.

275
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But I wouldn't mind a three-some with Amy Grant.

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can visualize that.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
A lot on some pretty interesting visual images.

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But I don't think he communicated it in a way that really, you know,

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
illustrated the point that we're dealing with.

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And it's not like an issue of somebody's soul.

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I think it's more an issue of like respect for people's personal values.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Now, before I go any further, I'm on your side as far as, you know,

283
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
kind of liberal, you know, enjoy the whole ear and say things like shit, piss, fuck,

284
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and, you know, such thing.

285
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We're bad.

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
As one who used to be involved in the search and kind of rebel against the dude

287
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and the legalism that I couldn't deal with.

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So, you know what's coming here.

289
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I'm just not going to accept this.

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That because someone believes in God or is a Christian that I can't,

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
we can't talk about naked bodies and naked pictures.

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And sex, come on.

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That makes no sense.

294
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm not saying anything about God.

295
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm just determined to have someone, whoever it is listening to this show,

296
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
finally send me a naked picture.

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
A proper one.

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's all.

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
How long have I been asking?

300
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a matter of respect.

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So, let me break it down.

302
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Dude, hold on a second.

303
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I got huge amounts of respect for Carmen Tyler.

304
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, please.

305
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Huge amounts of respect.

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think I showed that all the time.

307
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm just asking for a naked picture.

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm a road of a keyword player for country paths and rock paths.

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Anything goes most of the time.

310
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And you say a bunch of crazy shit that, you know,

311
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
turning people's hair gray.

312
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Right.

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But I also do a lot of work with gospel artists and CCM artists

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
because it is a genre of need that I am familiar with

315
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and that is part of my skill set.

316
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And none of that stuff would fly.

317
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah, but dude, if you said to any one of them, hey, you know,

318
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'd like a naked picture.

319
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, they got it.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is not blasphemy.

321
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They'd probably look at you go like, what are you talking about, son?

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What in blaze are you talking about?

323
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But, you know, would they be offended?

324
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well, that depends on your relationship.

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You know, I'm a Carla or not.

326
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Carla.

327
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Carmen and I have been communicating for a long time now back and forth.

328
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You know, and she's got plenty of sexy pictures on her website.

329
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And you should see, she's got this really sheer dress on.

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
On her, my space page.

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Come on.

332
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let's get a little bit of sense of humor here.

333
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You know, what do you guys worried?

334
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If Carmen doesn't like it, then she'll tell me.

335
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Um, not because people are prudish or this or that.

336
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's just that's where their personal values are added.

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And if I just started going off and saying crazy shit,

338
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
um, I'd never get hired.

339
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes, I do.

340
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't need to get hired by Carmen Tyler.

341
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't need to get hired.

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Just with naked pictures.

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I would not have the respect as a musician that I have with them.

344
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm not being safe.

345
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm just, you know, knowing when is a good time to say certain things.

346
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Right.

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay.

348
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So I guess there's no good time.

349
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If someone is Christian or believes in God, is there a good, just answer me this?

350
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Is there a good time to ask for naked pictures?

351
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I think the same thing goes with these naked pictures.

352
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You know, a lot of people on the Charlie that if you said that,

353
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
they would either comply.

354
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Ah, but no, my friend.

355
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No, that's not true.

356
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I just received a picture of Michelle's sister from whispered pearls.

357
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But, you know, it was like a glamorous.

358
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm looking for the raw webcam, grainy stuff.

359
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, they would laugh it off and kind of think with their heads.

360
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Lucky I'm not sending these naked pictures.

361
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But it would all be in fun.

362
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You know, I can't wait until people start sending video in

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
for a perversion for profit, which is my, my video podcast.

364
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
PFP dot pod show dot com.

365
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's pop of fucks.

366
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
dot pod show dot com perversion for profit.

367
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Send in your grainy webcam shots, please.

368
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know where Carmen Tyler is coming from on this.

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But it sounds to me like, heard the meaner on stage.

370
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And it gives her a lot of stuff that's on the team.

371
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And she's a very, I don't, I don't, I don't want to say refined person.

372
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But I think has a set of values that might not go along with wanting to send

373
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
you naked pictures.

374
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And I don't know if she would find it funny.

375
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I think she, and it's, again, I'm assuming.

376
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But I'm wondering if it's more of a, where she would feel

377
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
taking a back in a little uncomfortable.

378
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, she'd cut off there.

379
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's too bad, Kevin, because you were on it.

380
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You want to tear there, my friend.

381
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Sorry, you know, if Carmen has a problem with it,

382
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
then, uh, Garmin will tell me.

383
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I think this is just another example of political correctness

384
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
that has gone a mock in the United States of America.

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Come on, guys.

386
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You know, you're presuming all these things.

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You have no idea.

388
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Carmen's a beast.

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sure of it.

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Hi, Adam Bryan here from Portland.

391
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Just listening to your rant on the naked pictures thing.

392
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This country, I don't know.

393
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's getting really kind of scary.

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I was working at a thing the other day.

395
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Uh, what it was talking about, uh, populations and how many of those populations

396
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
believed in evolution versus, uh, some other form of whatever.

397
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And the United States is, like, second to last, as far as, uh,

398
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
people who believe in evolution have to be 50%.

399
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But still, it's, it beat out Turkey.

400
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Everybody else in the world thinks evolution is, like,

401
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
pretty much the way probably, you know, it worked out.

402
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, I'm not at all surprised that there are people who think that somehow naked pictures

403
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
agree with, with some kind of immorality.

404
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But it's like, uh, I understand your angst.

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's just disgusting.

406
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Anyway, thanks for their chill.

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And I'm still a folder, not the way to fight.

408
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Of course you're a folder.

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know, I'm with the folders.

410
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm quite sure that a lot of the evil in the world come from scrunchers.

411
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Look at, uh, just look at your favorite, uh, head of state.

412
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Wherever you live, wherever you're listening.

413
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And think to yourself, does that guy, or does that lady?

414
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because there's plenty of leaders of state who are women.

415
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Thank goodness.

416
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But you know they're going to be scrunchers.

417
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
A lot of them have got to be scrunchers.

418
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Just scrunch, do your business.

419
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I think scrunchers may be responsible for a lot of the problems in the world.

420
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm, I'm not, basically, it's not any scientific evidence.

421
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Just a hunch.

422
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But as you know, we're tracking it, keep letting me know.

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
When you call in, by the way, to the voice mail numbers.

424
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Plus one two zero one six two five six three five seven.

425
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Get out yourself.

426
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Punch the number in now so you can store it.

427
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So if you come up with a thought for later on, plus one two zero one six two five six three five seven.

428
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's on the show notes in London.

429
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
O two o seven six eight one three seven five three.

430
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
See how much time do I have before the satellite window closes?

431
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Um, crap.

432
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

433
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let me see.

434
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh, yeah.

435
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Boy, I really miscommunicated something the other day when Christine called in.

436
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I understood I think what she was asking for about, you know, is there a way when you listen to a podcast or watch a podcast I presume?

437
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
After you close everything out to have.

438
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And what she meant was the web browser version.

439
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
To have that actually remember where you were when you were playing that.

440
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So as an example, any player that is embedded into.

441
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Excuse me.

442
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sensei.

443
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Sensei.

444
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Sensei.

445
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, when brought you by go daddy.

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Use check out code DS three DSC three for your domain for the first year for $6.95.

447
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Um, the heck was I talking about?

448
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah.

449
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So any player that pops up into a web browser, you know,

450
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
whether it's a YouTube or garage band or pod show.

451
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You name it anywhere podcast alley and anything with the web browser.

452
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It pretty much can't remember where you were.

453
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And of course, tons of people called in and said, oh, well, you know,

454
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
iTunes does it.

455
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, of course, I understand iTunes does it.

456
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But the question was very specific.

457
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It was about the possibility of a web browser base player that actually could remember that on your computer,

458
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
where you where you left off playing.

459
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And I don't think it's very simple technically speaking.

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So I hope I've explained it a little bit better.

461
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Serious stars one or two is what you're listening to.

462
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
If you're hearing the show on the serious satellite network.

463
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's Thursday.

464
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So we've got Scott Siggler at the end of the evening.

465
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm just going to work backwards.

466
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So you know what's coming towards you.

467
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
East radio, email girl talk with Martina Butler.

468
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Digital flots in another episode of The Flotsam Tonight.

469
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Soccer girl incorporated Dawn and Drew right after Pacific Coast.

470
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm going to say Mark Yoshimaru and him cough.

471
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Bring you his stuff.

472
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Shit, as he calls it.

473
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That's an XPCH.

474
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And I'll talk to you guys tomorrow for the Friday edition of the Charlie.

475
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Speaking of bad communication skills.

476
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So I told you about my broken indicated air speed indicator.

477
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
My broken indicated air speed by broken air speed indicator.

478
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That's been mangled.

479
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I said something really stupid the other day when I was explaining that concept.

480
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
A couple of people picked up on it here.

481
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Listen to this.

482
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Hi Adam.

483
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's Andrew from the Geek Farm Life podcast.

484
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm a way back home from lunch.

485
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I listened to the SC445 and yeah.

486
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
By turning away lunch hours.

487
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
A good lunch hour.

488
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I went out to the airport.

489
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Jumped in my long easy.

490
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Which is a fixed moon plane.

491
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And went flying.

492
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Now.

493
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So anyway.

494
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Great lunch hour.

495
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Up with the cloud.

496
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's had a beautiful time.

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Let's come back.

498
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Listening to the SC445.

499
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
We were talking about your broken air speed indicator.

500
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And you're about nine minutes in.

501
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You're talking about how if you've had a headwind on the ground.

502
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The aircraft would show.

503
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Would list off that.

504
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Say.

505
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Fifty knots.

506
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The most of sixty knots.

507
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's.

508
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's completely wrong.

509
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You're confusing.

510
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Ground speed indicated air speed.

511
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The indicated air speed will always show.

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What the aircraft feels as the wind flowing over us.

513
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Or is the air flowing over the wind.

514
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
All right.

515
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Foreigners are the wing.

516
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So if you.

517
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
If the air speed's indicating sixty knots.

518
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It doesn't matter.

519
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What your ground speed is.

520
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Your plane doesn't really care.

521
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
If it's sixty knots or sixty knots.

522
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
No matter.

523
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Any other speed.

524
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And your craft will always perform the same.

525
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So if you're high altitude.

526
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
With a really high density altitude.

527
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Sixty knots.

528
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's still sixty knots.

529
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And air plane will still fly the same.

530
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I would disagree.

531
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But your decision to take off.

532
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
With the broken air speed indicator.

533
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But nonetheless.

534
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You should really review.

535
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
How air speed.

536
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Publicated air speed.

537
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Two air speed.

538
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Ground speed.

539
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
All right.

540
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You know.

541
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Relate to each other.

542
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And I really recommend a podcast called the finer points by Jason Miller.

543
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He's out in the San Francisco Bay area.

544
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And I'm sure he did a podcast.

545
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Exactly about this topic.

546
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Just a little while ago.

547
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And I really suggest you to check it out and review it.

548
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Because this is something that's very important.

549
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And understanding that it's a between.

550
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You know.

551
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Especially what indicated air speed and what air speed indicator shows you.

552
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's been a pleasure.

553
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Thanks a lot.

554
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Deal with.

555
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah.

556
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Of course.

557
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Now I'll tell you exactly what happened.

558
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I couldn't believe I said that when you point it.

559
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
A couple people pointed that out.

560
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You know what happened is.

561
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I had already firmly embedded into my head.

562
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The next time I get into this aircraft.

563
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I have to deduct 10 knots from whatever the indicated.

564
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I see now I'm messing it up already.

565
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I was going to put stickers.

566
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That's what I was going to do.

567
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I was going to put stickers on the air speed indicator.

568
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So there would be absolutely no confusion.

569
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Because I still got to fly it somewhere.

570
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's not a.

571
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah.

572
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's a technical issue.

573
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But at least it's a consistent one.

574
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And we know why it happened.

575
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Which also is the entire reason why I knew it was safe to.

576
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Safe to take off.

577
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
There was expectation that the air speed indicator might not work properly.

578
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We done our engine run ups and checks.

579
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The proper bin cycle that's a constant speed propeller.

580
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So we knew that that was functioning properly.

581
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So when you look at your your your your pressure your RPM your manifold.

582
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You know that you're you're going okay.

583
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And when this and when this when the plane starts to take off and it's indicating.

584
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
49 or 50 knots.

585
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You know.

586
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Which by the way is just a little bit under the.

587
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The stall speed as per the manual.

588
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And it's taken off.

589
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You know, there's a quick calculation is to what's going on.

590
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So I still could have aborted at any time.

591
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But the decision was split split second.

592
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And it was a it was a fine one.

593
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So I will stand by that.

594
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But I totally messed it up.

595
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Of course you're absolutely right.

596
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Um.

597
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
My explanation really blew.

598
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So the only thing that I have to remember, which I'll sticker.

599
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And not you know, there's a new one on order.

600
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And I really appreciate what you're saying.

601
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But you're absolutely right.

602
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's the the ground speed.

603
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That would that would differ significantly with with the headwind.

604
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But not the indicated air speed.

605
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And of course 60 knots is 60 knots worth of air flowing over your wings.

606
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And you'll get airborne, which of course is also what told me that.

607
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Something was wrong with my heartbeat indicator because I got airborne.

608
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What is all this talk on the daily source code about aviation.

609
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And actually do for you.

610
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Hey, Adam, it's Dean and so to go for you.

611
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The thing that DSC for four or five and you're talking about all the conversations you've had about being a pilot and all the detail you go into.

612
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And I think it's really great because you're never really sure when you're going to be on an airplane and the pilot and the co piloter.

613
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I was going to have the fish.

614
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So where's this kind of come out and say hey anybody know how to fly?

615
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I'm going to say that all the inner whatever.

616
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But unless you're the daily source code, I can do it.

617
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So it's important that you do these things.

618
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Thanks for just everything you do.

619
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Fly.

620
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You got to be a folder.

621
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
That's typical folder behavior.

622
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Of course.

623
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Hey, I'm not licensed, but yeah, I do actually know how to fly.

624
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Thanks to the daily source code.

625
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You just imagine that.

626
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You got a couple of authorities that checking on the show once in a while.

627
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Com extra blogger our European Union authority.

628
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And boy, he was right about about the influx of about the discussion in the United Kingdom about the influx of immigrants when was it two more countries are joining the EU in 2007.

629
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
All right, forget which ones they are.

630
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But there's a lot of talk now about you know, should we decide who can come in from where and you know, so CSB is pretty much.

631
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You know, he has this finger on the pulse of what's happening.

632
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
We have Uncle Jesse the satellite repair man, PW Fenton, who always always has something to say.

633
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm surprised he hasn't checked in yet with something about that whole moon landing debate, even though it's kind of over.

634
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And then there's, and then there's our buddy from the financial news, from the financial aid podcast,

635
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
who always can check in with some very authoritative sounding information about any topic.

636
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
In this case, it's actually, I think.

637
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
104.

638
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
104.

639
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's got to be pretty officially now.

640
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
104.

641
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It'll add moments.

642
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
104.

643
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
104.

644
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
104.

645
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
104.

646
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
104.

647
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It'll add moments.

648
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And now it's time for the 104.

649
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You'll have moment.

650
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Hey Adam, this is Chris from the financial aid podcast.

651
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Time for a proper 104.

652
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Which I should add, Christine's comment on DSE446 is about conspiracy theories, and not what's wrong with your computer.

653
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
What we're really talking about with the hair gel terrorists are binary compounds.

654
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
In the case of the most recent ones, they were according to press reports trying to manufacture TATB, or try acetone, try peroxide.

655
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
This is a combination of acetone and hydrogen peroxide requiring one other ingredient to make the reaction happen.

656
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And it's certainly not something you can do with off the shelf ingredients from the drug store, contrary to press reports.

657
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
In chemistry circles, it's considered exceptionally unstable, and will more than likely, into the person making it before it ever reaches a capacity to be an explosive.

658
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:34,000
There are plenty of other binary compounds out there that would do a better job, and nearly every college graduate who took a college level organ in chemistry course and paid attention could do better.

659
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Here's the conspiracy theory part.

660
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Any time you see something in the news, you have to ask, who benefits from this?

661
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
In the case of liquids being banned on planes and through security checkpoints, here's a question for Charlie listeners.

662
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Have the prices of beverages past the security checkpoints skyrocket again, now that you can't bring your own.

663
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Has someone checked on the stock prices of the various airport food service companies, acquiring minds want to know.

664
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
This is Christian the financial aid podcast with a proper tinfoil hat moment.

665
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
In the spirit of the tinfoil hat moment, scruncher or folder, you'll never know.

666
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
tinfoil hat moment.

667
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, I know you're a folder dude, you don't have to tell me.

668
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's okay.

669
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, Chris following the money there in that case.

670
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay, that's interesting.

671
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I doubt that it's a conspiracy by the tax tax-free shopping conglomerates.

672
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I just doesn't sound right.

673
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Or the food catering conglomerates, airline catering conglomerates.

674
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They're evil.

675
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
There's crunchers.

676
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
No doubt.

677
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah, maybe.

678
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't know.

679
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I really don't know.

680
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I did talk to a pilot buddy of mine yesterday.

681
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He has a command sheet between twin engine aircraft and he lives in Belgium.

682
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He says he has been never been so busy.

683
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
He flies back and forth between the mainland, the continent, and the United Kingdom.

684
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Three times a week now, he's doing flights.

685
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And I think he charges, I think he charges like 2,000 euros round trips.

686
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's something along those lines.

687
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So about what is that?

688
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
About 22, 2300 bucks.

689
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And of course, you can take four or five passengers.

690
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And he says businesses booming.

691
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
No one just wants to deal with the hassle anymore.

692
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's just too much hassle to get across this little puddle water.

693
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Now, I'm thinking, there's business in it for me.

694
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Once I get the airspeed indicator fixed.

695
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Sorry.

696
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That was pilot error.

697
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The Adam or Adam, please answer this.

698
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Are you getting frustrated?

699
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
A noise and a bit ticked.

700
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Are you always so impatient before a fast kiss?

701
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I've been boring, you say.

702
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Oh, dear sir, surely your emotions are strangely amazed.

703
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
All right.

704
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So this is the longest running promo in history.

705
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
This is the third riddle of, I don't know how many I'm going to get.

706
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And with riddle number two, I was already starting to get a little bit bored.

707
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Because it's basically a promo for a new podcast, which is out there somewhere.

708
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And I've tried everything so far.

709
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I haven't been able to figure it out.

710
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
We figured out the aviator.

711
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You know, it's like, it's like the games too difficult.

712
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's too hard for me to figure out.

713
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Please don't rush the planet and come soon.

714
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Just enjoy the mental full play.

715
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I've also be revealed prior to our next full moon.

716
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Are you always as eager?

717
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm so quickly bored as you said.

718
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Production must be extra clever to keep your mental the beaver well fed.

719
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, it's called naked pictures.

720
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But she has all skillful performances now.

721
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That pleasure keeps aches, explodes with added strokes that are slow.

722
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And now you're talking my language, baby.

723
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So we rise to your challenge of keeping you from tedium.

724
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You are promised not to die or let disappoint in.

725
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Think of them things.

726
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It shall be worth it in the end.

727
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
To ease your efforts, go to riddle.procho.com.

728
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Oh, okay.

729
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hold on a second.

730
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Now we're doing something interesting.

731
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Riddle.procho.com.

732
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay, what you got for me.

733
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Now I'm starting to like.

734
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This is kind of cool.

735
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
By the way, if you have an audio or video comment, you know,

736
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
people are always wondering, you know, how do I get that to?

737
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You can just open up account on podshow plus sign up as a podcaster,

738
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
which costs nothing.

739
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's completely free.

740
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And then you can just upload your stuff there.

741
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, it may get a promo or an ad inserted in front of it,

742
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
but there's always a little bit of space.

743
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So I can easily edit that out.

744
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's a great way to just share files.

745
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So if you want to send me a promo, do it that way.

746
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So here you go.

747
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Summary a series of riddle will be the longest playing promo.

748
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I guess riddles.

749
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I am the ridler.

750
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Listen to each clue to find a word or letter.

751
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Then assemble the words and letters into a name of a podcast.

752
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
None the better.

753
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I give these clues to letters or words.

754
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You determine the order of blah, blah, blah.

755
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So they have the archive while the riddles up there.

756
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
All right.

757
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Hold on.

758
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
This a link here.

759
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Show producer.

760
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You can't escape.

761
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Show.

762
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Okay.

763
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It's all right.

764
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's going to the ridler.podshow.com.

765
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Let's see what this is.

766
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
This is something our site is doing something dumb here.

767
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What it does is if you go to a subdomain, then it basically recaches all the images and stuff,

768
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
which it already has.

769
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Let's do what we got to fix that.

770
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Okay.

771
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Now the sites here.

772
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm the ridler.

773
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Listen to each clue to find a word of blah, blah, blah, blah.

774
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Okay.

775
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So nothing there.

776
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Oh.

777
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Here are some clues.

778
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Shows a review.

779
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Daily source code.

780
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And the Elizabeth Street Brewery.

781
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
That's Richard Brewer Hayes.

782
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Podcast.

783
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
People I dig the podpimp.

784
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Who's the podpimp?

785
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I thought the podpimp was Aaron Bersel, our parent.

786
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Who's the podpimp?

787
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
The name start out as a joke.

788
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
CTWD.

789
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The podpimp was always pimping podcash,

790
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
or after podshow call.

791
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And well, the podfather hung the podpimp moniker.

792
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I promote podcast night and day.

793
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's hard out here for a pimp.

794
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Oh, the hell is that?

795
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
There's a YouTube video here.

796
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Let's see what this is.

797
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
This is stupid.

798
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, why am I not hearing that?

799
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh, yeah.

800
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
All right.

801
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Whatever.

802
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I have no clue.

803
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I don't know what this is.

804
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And quite honestly, you better start sending some naked pictures.

805
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Winding up the charlotte with some charge.

806
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Start a good end of the destroyers.

807
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The pod save music network.

808
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Where are we?

809
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Any town?

810
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
New S.A.

811
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Take me back, leave it.

812
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
From the blast to Jacob's been.

813
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Take me back, leave it.

814
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I forgot I go to sit and feel.

815
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
They got the house of blues on his face.

816
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And the rocker on the face.

817
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Take me back, leave it.

818
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'ma get it and attack you with me.

819
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You gotta take this back, Detroit.

820
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I think they're missing it.

821
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm going to the motor set.

822
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Cause I'm a lambland game with mine.

823
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But be sure it wins, keep turning.

824
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, baby, I'm alive.

825
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Take me back, Detroit.

826
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
All right, get it and it's filled you with me.

827
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Nice.

828
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But every time I play this town,

829
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The people train me so right.

830
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Every time I come to you, I'll sit in.

831
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I will run home then.

832

I laid a Georgia tune

840

We got a man

841
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000

Take me back to LA

That's what you see me

844
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
George Thorough

845
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000

The Chali, the Chak

867
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But it's acronym contains the clue that's a mark

868
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
The first of your three is the first of our second

869
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So one

870
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Then the solution

871
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You shall reckon

872
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
TK of them

873
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Daily

874
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Okay, I got that

875
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I don't know

876
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You show better be so interesting to me

877
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm gonna be really mad for playing along

878
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
This is no good

879
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
All right everybody

880
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I would really love to have some suggestions for the

881
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Football Friday

882
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That's what I'm gonna call it now

883
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Since we have a football at the office

884
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Football Friday

885
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
If you don't know what football stands for

886
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Look it up, FUBAR

887
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
So send in some suggestions for stuff for me to play

888
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That means the weekend is almost here again

889
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Gonna go flying again this weekend

890
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
You know it for sure

891
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Airspeed indicator or not

892
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
As the wind commander would say

893
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I see a lot of birds without an airspeed indicator

894
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So have a good one

895
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
