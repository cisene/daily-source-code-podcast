Delta Sierra Charlie 3-8-8 Hello America I love a podcasting in America when it came

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,240
to podcasting about the microphone and downloaded audacity.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,200
My show would be called Tatooine TV, the funniest Star Wars audio birdies on the internet

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,880
period at jrdonline.com.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,680
I have recorded 30 podcasts but I still only have a few hundred downloads a month.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,320
I want to really podcast world like Dawn and Drew, what can I do?

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Sorry you wish my help.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Have you been listening to me?

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Yes.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,320
But you know you don't sound anything like you did on MTV.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,320
It's just in sale.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,320
Do you listen to the Charlie every day?

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Charlie who?

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,320
The Daily Source Code, the DSC.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,320
The podcast that is a life and breath of podcasting everywhere.

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
The Charlie.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,320
No, I don't have time to listen to another podcast.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,320
I spend my days writing funny Star Wars parody bits for my podcast.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,320
You wish me to help you become a phenomenon.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,320
But if you don't listen to the DSC every day, then I cannot do.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Listen.

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
A bias in sale and move to England.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Well, 2 and a 3-8 bed.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Okay.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Have you ever interviewed Jeff Ron?

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
I feel the need.

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
The need.

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
First day.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,320
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,320
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

35
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Fantastic.

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Isn't that scary?

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,320
I've done without me.

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Maybe one day we'll see things I'll say.

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Feeling sorry.

40
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,320
I ever felt this way.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Feeling sorry.

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,320
No one else to play.

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Yeah.

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Time all my sight and I have all the dreams.

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,320
I know what I'm saying for me.

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
I'm feeling fine.

47
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,320
For this I feel dreams.

48
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,320
And all I'm saying for me.

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:18,320
I never saw it coming.

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,320
I expect it.

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm sure it is somehow.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Feeling sorry.

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,320
I never said I can.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Sorry.

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,320
With all I can for now.

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Time all my sight and I have all the dreams.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:52,320
I know what I'm saying for me.

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm feeling fine.

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,320
For this I feel dreams.

60
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,320
And all I'm saying for me.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm feeling fine.

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Time all my sight and I have all the dreams.

63
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I know what I'm saying for me.

64
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm feeling fine.

65
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,320
With this I feel dreams.

66
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:15,320
And all I'm saying for me.

67
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Wow.

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
I can be almost considered a golden holy.

69
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm going to show Lady Patricia.

70
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,320
I was ready 35 minutes ago.

71
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
And that was after we had already agreed.

72
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
She was going to take her walk on the downs.

73
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
And then she'd come back and then we'd start the show.

74
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,320
And so I was ready in about her 15 minute walk.

75
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,320
And I'm ready and I'm waiting.

76
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
And I'm waiting.

77
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
And I'm like, what's going on?

78
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Now the in-laws are here.

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,320
So things are a little bit different.

80
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Stuff is a guess done out of order.

81
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
And too early or too late.

82
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
So Patricia was still doing her makeup.

83
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
It's a podcast.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
It really doesn't matter.

85
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Hello.

86
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Here she comes.

87
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
So we had to wait for that.

88
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,320
And she just went down to make us a bit of tea.

89
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,320
And I'm delaying the intro.

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Hi.

91
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Hello.

92
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Hello.

93
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Yeah.

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Yes.

95
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Luckily.

96
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Hey, baby.

97
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Thank you.

98
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Okay.

99
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
In the cottage studio.

100
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Just wait while my lovely co-host gets situated.

101
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Look at your chair ready.

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I've got your ear buds ready.

103
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Ready to fall into your cleavage.

104
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
You're invited.

105
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
You're invited.

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
That's right.

107
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Hey, baby.

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Oh, hello.

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm so happy.

110
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Okay.

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
We're going around.

112
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Yeah, exactly.

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm so happy.

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
You joined me on the show today.

115
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Oh, yeah.

116
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Yeah.

117
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Because I've.

118
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
You're a bit exhausted.

119
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm just a little bit.

120
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah.

121
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Yeah.

122
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
It's been like nonstop.

123
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
How much can a person handle more than this?

124
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I'm sure I can handle even more.

125
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
But I just like.

126
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Yeah.

127
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Could I have to go to the dentist at three o'clock today?

128
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Oh, you love that.

129
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
No.

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
I hate it.

131
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
But now, but this is for a full.

132
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Please.

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Yeah.

134
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
I like that.

135
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
I like that.

136
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
I don't like it while they're doing it.

137
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Fresh from the dentist feeling.

138
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Yeah.

139
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
And then you can run your tongue along my teeth.

140
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Yeah.

141
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Your teeth are nice.

142
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
On thing?

143
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,320
We miss a part.

144
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Patricia's having.

145
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
What is it?

146
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Well, I have.

147
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Two thousand hour maintenance program that you're.

148
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,320
People who know, who know me a little bit and people who seem.

149
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Everybody knows you, baby.

150
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
See my picture.

151
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
I've gorgeous teeth.

152
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Yes, they are.

153
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
We start like.

154
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Yeah.

155
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
That costs a fortune.

156
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Uh-huh.

157
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Because I'm one of these people.

158
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,320
We spread it out over three husbands like my god.

159
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,320
I invest so much money in my mouth.

160
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Sound strange.

161
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
You put your money where your mouth is, baby.

162
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Exactly.

163
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,320
So I'm one of these people that are.

164
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Extremely unlucky with my teeth.

165
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Yeah.

166
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
You know, nobody ever.

167
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Yeah.

168
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Notices.

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Notices.

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Notices.

171
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
I knew I said something.

172
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Have you been smoking my splits?

173
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
I don't know.

174
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
I've been talking with Dutch a lot.

175
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,320
And so you don't see it.

176
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
But if you knew.

177
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
How much work is this?

178
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
It's a struggle.

179
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,320
So this is another six months program you're on.

180
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Yeah.

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Now I get new implants in there.

182
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Yeah.

183
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Now these are.

184
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Because they get bleak.

185
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
And then they're on.

186
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Now these are.

187
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Because they get bleak.

188
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
And then they pull them out.

189
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Not the teeth, the front teeth, the front teeth out.

190
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
They're beautiful.

191
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
It's on the side.

192
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
But it's all the mullers and everything.

193
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,320
And you know, these days they just make sure that you get new ones.

194
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Yeah.

195
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
But it's quite a procedure.

196
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Quite a procedure.

197
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
God.

198
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
It takes a long time.

199
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Yeah.

200
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
You have to be very patient.

201
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
And it's painful.

202
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
But I go for it.

203
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Yeah.

204
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I do it.

205
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
It's very important.

206
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Because it's so important to chew and to eat your food and enjoy your food.

207
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Which is very good for your stomach.

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Which is very good for your body.

209
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Which is very good for your whole health condition.

210
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Exactly.

211
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Absolutely.

212
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
And as we know, you are.

213
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Do you wear a life itself?

214
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Yeah.

215
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
But what?

216
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
You have to invest in your life.

217
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Yeah.

218
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
You know.

219
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Cost a lot of money.

220
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,320
I can't understand that some people, if you cannot afford it.

221
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
What do you do?

222
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Well, you know, if you look a lot of the British teeth around you.

223
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Yeah.

224
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
People aren't doing much.

225
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Yeah.

226
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Well, there's plenty of oral professionals here in the UK.

227
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm reliably informed.

228
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
I said I'm reliably informed.

229
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Okay.

230
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Oh, but you know, remember, I make the trip to China.

231
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Yes.

232
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,320
And what I noticed is that all Chinese people,

233
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
most of the Chinese people have very bad teeth.

234
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Oh, really?

235
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Yeah.

236
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Because they probably have no dental care there at all.

237
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
No dental care at all.

238
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Right.

239
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Yeah.

240
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Very strange.

241
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
It goes, you know, they have sort of their own.

242
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
All messed up.

243
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
messed up in your mouth.

244
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
It's, it's amazing.

245
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Okay.

246
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Patricia's going to be with us for the entire show.

247
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
A couple of problems I got to do though.

248
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
And especially this one.

249
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Because this is from the satellite repair.

250
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Wow.

251
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Faithful digital flats and listeners may remember back to episode number 22,

252
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,320
where my dad proved that all adolescent boys are brain dead.

253
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
He told the story of how he and a group of his young friends burned down

254
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
a wooded hillside while playing with matches.

255
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
A girl would never do anything like that.

256
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Well, I beg to differ.

257
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Hi.

258
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
I'm PW Fountain.

259
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
And that was the voice of my daughter, Billy.

260
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,320
We think that girls can be just as brain dead as boys.

261
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Keep an ear peeled for digital flats number 36 in which she will plead her case.

262
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I've played that for you before.

263
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Have I did digital flats?

264
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
PW Show?

265
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Hey, tell stories.

266
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Yeah.

267
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Oh, yeah.

268
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Not as much as daughter.

269
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Billy.

270
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I haven't heard that.

271
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
I don't think she, well, yes, she's, I don't know if she's been.

272
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Don't you know, ready?

273
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Well, no, she's, I have no idea what this is about.

274
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
We have to listen to the show, I guess.

275
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
That's quite the promo.

276
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
It's a teaser.

277
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Oh, Christina will be so jealous.

278
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Well, that she's not doing her show.

279
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Yeah.

280
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
It's like, well, how much do I have to do?

281
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm not going to force her to...

282
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
She wants it.

283
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,320
But, you know, she's very busy with school and she...

284
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
And boys.

285
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
And boys and socialize.

286
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
So incredibly busy with the boys.

287
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Yeah.

288
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Wow.

289
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
You know what I just saw?

290
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I saw a long time ago, but I've seen it again.

291
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,320
And I didn't know they had Oprah over here in the...

292
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Yeah.

293
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Yeah.

294
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
I didn't know that.

295
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
So I found her again.

296
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
And...

297
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
They were...

298
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Goodness.

299
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm so happy.

300
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Yeah.

301
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
And they were talking about something that is very close to my heart,

302
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
because it's sometimes...

303
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
I hated too, actually.

304
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
And that is that lots of...

305
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
There was a man who said that all the webcams,

306
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,320
especially the webcams that kids have, teenagers,

307
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
should be destroyed.

308
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Really?

309
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Because it is...

310
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
What's that?

311
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Why the problem?

312
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
So we're showing on.

313
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
And the only...

314
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
They only have webcams to show themselves.

315
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
To have porn to have sex.

316
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
That's what he said.

317
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
And that's what they were talking about.

318
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,320
And there was a boy in the studio who actually started a thing in his bedroom,

319
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
just for fun, show himself.

320
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,320
You know, hi, waving, getting on dress loop.

321
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
And he's now a web 2.0 millionaires.

322
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
This is my body.

323
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Do you see that?

324
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
And then he got reactions.

325
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Yeah.

326
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
No kidding.

327
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
And...

328
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh, we want to see this one.

329
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
For money.

330
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
People would send him money.

331
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Yeah.

332
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
So, you know, while he was doing that,

333
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
and then suddenly I thought that this is...

334
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
This is wrong.

335
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
So he told his dad.

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
And...

337
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Okay.

338
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
That's really wrong.

339
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Because he was in trouble.

340
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Somebody wanted to kill him.

341
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Somebody wants to come to his house.

342
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
So he thought this is not good.

343
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
This is not going anywhere.

344
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
So he told his dad.

345
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
And the dad just...

346
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
He was talking to Oprah about it.

347
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,320
And he said that pediatricians, they were lawyers.

348
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Oh, yeah, of course.

349
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
He worked with children.

350
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Sure.

351
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Actually, most of the people were people who were...

352
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Who worked with children, who were doing this,

353
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
who were having it out really.

354
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,320
And so now he's protected by the government,

355
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
because...

356
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
But listen, they have to move.

357
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
But listen, my dear.

358
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,320
But so he said, all the webcams, for kids,

359
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
it's wrong.

360
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
They have to, you know, destroy them.

361
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
I'm there.

362
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,320
We'll destroy all the webcams after we get rid of all the guns.

363
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Okay?

364
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Which one do you think is more dangerous?

365
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
The gun laying around the house or the webcam?

366
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Nobody was there in Oprah's show tonight.

367
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
No, no.

368
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Of course not.

369
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
An Oprah or Oprah.

370
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Or...

371
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Orka.

372
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Orka wouldn't say that.

373
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
But, you know, isn't that just a little screwy

374
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
when you think about it in the United States,

375
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,320
where webcams have to be banned before semi-automatic handguns?

376
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
But this is for the kids protection.

377
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
What do you think guns are?

378
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
What do you think has guns in their hands?

379
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
They're kids disappearing.

380
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,320
We had this whole discussion with your mom just the other day.

381
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
It's like...

382
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,320
She said, where is this world going to?

383
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
All these horrible things I read about in the newspaper.

384
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,320
I said, we're going in the same direction we came from.

385
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
She grew up literally.

386
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Always an answer.

387
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
But she was literally what?

388
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,320
She was eight years old, ten years old during the Second World War.

389
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
The Nazis were bombing Rotterdam?

390
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
No, she was...

391
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Eighteen.

392
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Eighteen.

393
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Really?

394
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
She was a Christian.

395
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
You're right. She's 80 already.

396
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
So she was a young woman.

397
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Witness this.

398
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
Now, which one?

399
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
I mean, come on.

400
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
I mean, yeah, there's shit that happens.

401
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
I think it's just, you know, we're hearing about it consistently.

402
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
And it's all bundled in a nice little package,

403
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
calls the newspaper, which is delivered, you know,

404
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,320
this nice package of crap is delivered to your doorstep every single morning.

405
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Here's something to depress you about.

406
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Yeah.

407
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Yeah.

408
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
But it's not like...

409
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Well, bad people.

410
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
The world has been around.

411
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Exactly.

412
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Exactly.

413
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
The evil time.

414
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
I think all the good things we're doing with webcams.

415
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
And all those stories, when I said, all those stories.

416
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Remember, Jack the River.

417
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Allton, Jack the River.

418
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Mm-hmm.

419
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
In the London fog.

420
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Exactly.

421
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
All those little alleys where people got murdered.

422
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Well, but these car jackings, like, well,

423
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,320
you think you even said it, that they used to stop your stage coach.

424
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Chop your fucking head off and take your gold.

425
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
And take your horses.

426
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Yeah.

427
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
And screw your horses.

428
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Take your gold chop your head off.

429
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Mm-hmm.

430
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
No way, man.

431
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Yeah, I know.

432
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I know.

433
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Tell, but it's not really.

434
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
You know, women mothers, women mothers.

435
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
And sometimes you lay away from it.

436
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,320
And yes, every time I come in and hurt cameras on it,

437
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
what are you doing?

438
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Yeah.

439
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
What are you looking at?

440
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
But she's on MSN chat and then they have the webcam with her bodies.

441
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
I've looked at it.

442
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I said, Mom, I know.

443
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I know who they are.

444
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
I recognize and write away if something's stupid.

445
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Oh, I think OK.

446
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,320
I think it's a very limited phase that most kids go through.

447
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Most of them come out of it on the other hand.

448
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
It's like, oh, look at all this stuff we can do with our camera.

449
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Yeah.

450
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
We know what we can do with the camera.

451
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Give a camera to your chin.

452
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Give a camera to your chin.

453
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
You're a San Francisco.

454
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Excuse me.

455
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Well, we're in San Francisco.

456
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
We're looking at each other.

457
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Oh, on the eye chat.

458
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
On the eye chat.

459
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Yeah.

460
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
That's hot, baby.

461
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
But you're so like, are you sure no one can see this?

462
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Yeah.

463
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
I don't know.

464
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
It doesn't make it just a little bit more exciting, baby.

465
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Anyway, it's so naughty.

466
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
You're so naughty.

467
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
You're so naughty.

468
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Mm-hmm.

469
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
See?

470
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Adam, don't do that.

471
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Don't do that.

472
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Somebody!

473
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
Get a bigger lens.

474
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
I can't see it's all.

475
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Now I didn't say this.

476
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
No.

477
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
No.

478
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
No.

479
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
No.

480
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
No.

481
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
No.

482
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
No.

483
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
No.

484
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
No.

485
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
No.

486
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
It doesn't.

487
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
It doesn't.

488
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
It doesn't.

489
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
It doesn't.

490
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
It doesn't.

491
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
It doesn't.

492
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
It doesn't.

493
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,320
It doesn't.

494
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Are you going to say, you know, you're going to be playing around?

495
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Oh.

496
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Up.

497
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Pfft.

498
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
People are really dirty.

499
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I didn't go out.

500
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
People are really clean.

501
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
onia more.

502
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Yeah.

503
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
He was fine.

504
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Give up.

505
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Get him.

506
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
C'mon.

507
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
You put his hand out.

508
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
He's actually rink of inside.

509
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
he's sitting and doing something big.

510
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
OHA!

511
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
OK.

512
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
This guy is going to be human.

513
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,200
So he's like, that's my kid is crying as bloody eyes out because I have a neglected and for two days

514
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,640
or I've been in second life the virtual world known as second life. He couldn't take the boy with him.

515
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,360
Well, no little vip chair. Vip chair.

516
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,000
Vip chair.

517
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,600
Yeah, we love those voicemail comments, 201-625-635-7 in New Jersey again in London,

518
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:59,040
O2-076-81375-3 and there have been a couple of since you and I spoke there's been lots of

519
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,160
pro and con, you know, second life is good, second life is bad, you know, virtual world's good, virtual world's

520
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,040
bad, I don't care, I do care. You want to hear some some more responses? Okay.

521
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,760
Okay.

522
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,320
Hi, now you're doing this is Chuck from Jersey.

523
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,880
Joyce is a local column in South Jersey but I grow up and someone calls for the north.

524
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,600
How do you write? It's good to hear that somebody's proud of being from Jersey. I catch someone

525
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:28,400
just like I work in Pennsylvania. But anyway, just wanted to come there real quick about our negative

526
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,720
feedback you're getting about dreaming and your second life talk. Everyone listen to your show

527
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,600
simply because they want to hear what you're doing and things like that and pod show and

528
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,400
everything like that. I personally don't have a training myself but I enjoy listening to the

529
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,000
trendies and for what I'm hearing from all the feedback everybody's loving it. All the sudden you

530
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,400
start talking about second life and because people are involved in second life they're all upset

531
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,760
about everybody's got a light interrupt it's part of what you are. You're in the second life right

532
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,240
now and inspired me to sign up. I haven't had a chance to get in it myself yet but I signed up for

533
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,760
the delicious thing. Anyway, people need a light and I'll have fun how talk to you soon

534
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,680
later on the show. See, that's a Jersey boy sticking together, right? I'm in my third life already.

535
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,080
Oh yeah, one does that start at 50? You're third life starts? Yeah, that's 50. You're still enjoying it?

536
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,920
Oh absolutely. Yeah. Okay. Always take my teeth back. Me too. I could be driving a Ferrari.

537
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:41,040
Hey Adams is reigning with from second life. Do you realize it is three o'clock in the

538
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,440
fricken morning and I still haven't been to bed yet. I've been up chatting with everybody in

539
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,320
second life hanging out at the Castle Cove just enjoying the dialogue and having a good time.

540
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,480
It has completely sucked me in. Anyway, Adam, you and I share a similar situation. My husband

541
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,760
completely doesn't understand second life. Things that's just the game and waste of time just

542
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:17,760
does not get it at all. Does that? Well, let's be honest. It is a waste of time. Well, it doesn't

543
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:28,400
not. It means if you have to, how do you say that? If you can't spend any time with somebody

544
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,480
or, you know, your family and you're so busy and so involved in it, yet then. No, it's problem.

545
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,880
That's a problem. That's what I mean. So actually met a guy yesterday through second life.

546
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
I told you about this last night, we're actually going to be business with him. And I met him

547
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,440
right in on the roof of the castle. It doesn't get vlogging, which is something else I like to do.

548
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,080
So anyway, also wanted to tell you that I absolutely love the person coming on the show.

549
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,600
I think she's awesome. I love the dialogue between the two of you and she just add something really

550
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,320
special to the show. Yeah, who does? So keep up the good work and I'll see you in second life.

551
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,040
I've been a DSC listener and a cober and I love the Charlie. Good night. Good night.

552
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:23,600
Okay, say hi to you husband. I know a good. I do not. I do not sit up until three o'clock in the

553
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:31,600
morning. No, because I don't take that. I just slap you. No, you don't. No, but I just keep on saying,

554
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,080
huh, are you coming to bed now? Yeah, and I keep saying, yes, in a minute, I'll be right there.

555
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,520
Yeah. And then I try things. But often that I'm actually doing things in, you know,

556
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,360
on San Francisco time. Yeah. That's what I'm usually doing. Yeah. But it has to be with our sex life a little bit.

557
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,680
Bullshit. That's total bullshit. You were in second life while I was waiting. Yeah, but I don't feel.

558
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,520
I don't feel very sexy at all lately. Because of second life? No. No, I know.

559
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,440
I just, my head isn't different. No, I know. I know. I know.

560
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,160
Yeah. And just joking. Just. That's what you say. Well, apparently could you tell me what day that was,

561
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:15,760
so I can reconstruct and see how did I miss the signals? You just don't recognize it now. Then

562
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:24,240
and if you don't respond, then I go back in my bedroom when they're okay. It's okay, Han. It's okay.

563
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:32,400
That's why our marriage is so perfect. What? What? Doesn't matter. No, I'm just, there's so much going on.

564
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
If you have a brainy husband, that's, yeah. And what does that mean?

565
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,040
You don't brainy. Are you not satisfied? Do I not satisfied with you?

566
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
Yes, you do. Okay. Do I not satisfied with you often enough? No.

567
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:52,560
Are you kidding me? Oh, man. Really? Yeah. But it's, but we have a teenager running around the house all

568
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,200
hours. Your mom and dad are running around. Yeah. Yeah. Here. Just for two days. I mean,

569
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,680
they're here two days now. Yeah. And already are you tired of it? No. No, I don't mean it like that.

570
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,480
No, they're going to help me while and help us while we're going to. I know that. I know,

571
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,520
but usually after about a week of them being in the house. Can you imagine you have two

572
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:23,440
80 or 80 old 80 year olds? Yeah, it won't. Can't speak anymore. 80 year olds in the house.

573
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,320
I mean, that's not easy. Because they repeat a lot for those of you.

574
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,160
Yeah, mom, you just told me that for those of you listening on Syria stars 102 coming up

575
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,320
today. We've got Pacific Coast Hellway, which is next followed by East Radio Don and Drew

576
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,960
Gilmore Daily. And then I think it's episode 36 now, the pod show music rewind. The rest of

577
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,840
this show you can find a daily source code dot com. But my parents are fantastic.

578
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,320
Oh, the fantastic. It's so sweet. But they just don't so nice and so young for their age. Yes.

579
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,560
Very good. And I'm very, very lucky to have them. I'm still kind of stuck on this whole. I don't

580
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,080
satisfy you enough. Oh, stop. We're going on a trip together. You realize that, right?

581
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,720
Yeah, just you and me. That's what I was thinking about. I'm saving myself for you.

582
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:20,560
Okay. Yeah. Hi, dear. How did the visit at the doctor go? Did the doctor say?

583
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,040
Just as I thought, the Marcus just has a slight speech to lay and that he's a boy. And then it's

584
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:37,760
no big deal. What? He has autism? Oh, no. Hi. This is Michael Bull from autismpodcast.org.

585
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,320
My wife and I had a very similar conversation to that one. And we were looking for help as

586
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,120
soon as we found out about our son. That's why I started an autism podcast.

587
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,000
In autism podcast, we interviewed specialists about some of the latest therapies, parents about

588
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,600
their experiences, as well as teachers who teach kids on this spectrum. If you're looking for some

589
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,640
information delivered in an audio format for autism, which now afflix about one and 166 kids born

590
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:14,240
today, head to www.autismpodcast.org or in iTunes, just search for Autismpodcast. Thank you.

591
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,440
Changing the world, huh? Wow. Isn't that cool? That's cool. Yeah, there's a lot of really

592
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,440
interesting, we're putting together a whole channel of family and health and stuff. There's a lot

593
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,360
of really good stuff out there. This is good. I got to do my Tourette podcast. Yeah. It should be a

594
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,520
video podcast. Isn't it wonderful to talk about your problems like that? I have no problem.

595
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,680
Problem talking about my problems. No, I mean, about things that you, you know,

596
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,360
like, did you live with? Like, not satisfying my wife. Often enough. Yeah, that's just wonderful

597
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,920
baby. And Tourette? I think, but it's so charming. I love you Tourette. Thank you. Really? Yeah,

598
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,920
it's very interesting. If I could combine that with my sexual activity, then maybe I'll satisfy

599
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,840
you long time. I love you long time, girl. Yeah. But you know, it changes in your body.

600
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,800
So it's great. Sometimes it's there. Down there. That, that I control. I have, I have

601
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:22,800
total, deep control. I'm getting better. Yeah, I'm really in trouble. There's a new pod,

602
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,040
even the pod finder. Right? That's the thing we do for iTunes. Yeah. We highlight all new

603
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,040
podcasts. There's a new one out. I think today. And there was this one pod cast in it, which is

604
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,840
so well done. I just wanted to play, uh, I think it's just, I don't know if it's a whole episode

605
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
of just a piece of it. It's called the weekly radio address podcast. You know, the president

606
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,360
does a weekly radio address. Yeah. In fact, it was a Kennedy, it made Roosevelt started those,

607
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,920
the fire side chats. And so the president still does them. No one, I don't think anyone cares about

608
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,280
them. Uh, but this is a parody. I definitely care about this version. Now a message from the president

609
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:03,280
of the United States, George W. Bush. Good morning. This week began a bold new era in promotion of

610
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:10,880
alternative energies to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil. As my scientific advisors

611
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,800
have explored the new types of automobiles for the next century. They have devised the people powered

612
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:24,480
car. Giant holes will be cut in the floor beneath these cars so that the driver can propel the vehicle

613
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,520
forward with a running barefoot start. This automobile will be lighter. The frame constructed of

614
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:39,680
simple twigs and animal heads. Instead of rubber tires, more foot-efficient stone wheels are going to

615
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,520
be used. And finally replacing the horn will be a squawking prehistoric bird,

616
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,120
conserving power by using nature's voices. Just pull his tail and use the cries of primi

617
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,240
will be the worn other drivers of oncoming dangers. These new cars will hold up to two families

618
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,800
allowing you and your friends to go to the driving movies or to the Bronto Burger Hut. He style,

619
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,280
but science is still confounded on how to keep the car upright when large cuts of meat are served.

620
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:21,440
But we are a nation of innovators and we must work together to solve these problems and move into a

621
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,560
bold new age of the future. Thank you for listening and God bless you. Yeah, well it almost sounds good,

622
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,320
isn't it? I thought it was really good. I like that a lot. I got so many comments about

623
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,120
the earbuds falling in your cleavage. I'd call them guys. You haven't, I know you haven't heard it

624
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,280
because let's face it, you don't care about the show. I've never listened to the show unless you're on it.

625
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,720
I don't listen to what I'm on. Even when you're not on it. Yeah, it's something I can hear when I'm

626
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,040
walk through the house. So we have it was a Cheechen Chong, one guy named his wife's breast,

627
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,960
Cheechen Chong and then some other guy actually called up and said, well, you know,

628
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,480
one of his wife's breasts is smaller so they call that one tiny. It's like this is so wrong.

629
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,160
And that's all like that. I just want to talk about Patricia's breasts. Yeah, I mean you've been gone for two

630
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:31,840
days. Look what happens. Yeah, I refer to you as dude. Yeah, yeah, what's up with that?

631
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,160
Because we're buttons. Also, what's up with that? Yeah, what's up with that? Do I call you dude all the time?

632
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,800
Hey, dude, dude listen to this. Do you mind? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I call you babe. Baby, honey,

633
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:53,600
hun. That's from the whole area. Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. Check out this

634
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,600
mix dude. I'm one of the dudes. Is it him? Is it him? Oh, it's not. Is it him? No, it's not him.

635
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Yeah, I'll continue. Okay, today about Patricia fly around to eat broose dick. I guess well,

636
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:13,040
I'll be saying tailwinds to her now. Thank you. Tailwinds. My broose dick, yeah. Tailwinds. Exactly.

637
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:20,560
Yeah, tailwinds. Tailwinds, not wings, wings. Tailwinds. Tailwinds. Okay. So you excited about the trip?

638
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Yeah, I am. Yeah. You know, we have to, we have to do shows when we're on the road. You realize

639
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,920
that don't you? No, really? Yeah, so I mean, here's my life, right? So we're speaking in New York.

640
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,760
We have to go get our marriage papers. We have to do shows. And I have to satisfy you long time.

641
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,080
So I'm going to be a really, really busy guy. I don't know what I'm going to do.

642
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm going to be a younger than I am. You sure? Today, I feel old. I talked to my mom for like 45 minutes.

643
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,960
Draining. Yeah. Yeah, and the horrible thing is the blisters in her mouth.

644
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,560
From whatever they're talking about. More things. If somebody is in that situation as your

645
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:10,240
mom is, you want to talk to them, but sometimes you're scared to talk to them because you're afraid

646
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,960
that you might say something different or wrong or, you know, it's so hard because you want to

647
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,440
help. You want to talk to them. But anything you say is not good enough. It's not, you know,

648
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,560
helping it all. No, but I think my mom and I, we, we've, we've definitely moved beyond that stage.

649
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,800
It's really easy for us to talk about it. You're very good at it. Yeah, she loves to talk to you.

650
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, because you, you throw a bit of humor in it. And you know, now what else do you do?

651
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,240
Yeah, what else? I mean, what is the best thing? You don't know. And I think keeping the humor

652
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,560
and, and yeah, and that's what I say. Just try to, we have to try to stay positive. That's

653
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:00,560
so much better for the, for her body. Yeah. So, well, hopefully they'll get the, uh, the pain,

654
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,120
uh, and the control, and licks or whatever they're, so now they're, they're uping the morphine and,

655
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,680
you know, the uping the pretness on and whatever, uping a lot is what I'm hearing. Yeah. But

656
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,200
she didn't sound just stoned. No, no, no, God. Whatever she had, they gave her last time.

657
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,040
She used to totally whacked. Totally. And I couldn't help but laugh. But yeah, because she'd say,

658
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,400
she'd be talking to me about something. She said, no, where is that ham? Yeah, it's with this.

659
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,640
There's no way. Wait a minute, mom, I got to catch up to your hold on and not stoned enough to fall.

660
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:42,320
Yeah, conversation. Yeah, uh, okay. Um, let me see, whatever. Oh, yeah, this is, uh,

661
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,320
uh, just a couple of promos. I got to do hunt. Then we'll wind up with some pod safe music. Okay. Okay. All right.

662
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,000
Remember this song? You heard his music on Adam Curry's daily source code.

663
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,720
Wonder what pod safe pianist Rob Costlos been up to six? Yes. Yeah.

664
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,280
A flashters well for very videos and documentaries.

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,840
Tune in on Monday. May the 22nd from my interview with pod safe music artist Rob Costo and

666
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,040
find out what he's been up to at trucker-tong.podshow.com.

667
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,360
You haven't met Trucker Tom, have you? You've you've met me? You've seen a picture of him, right?

668
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,680
Yeah. Yeah, I sent all kinds of minerals and stuff for you. He's always coming back with all kinds of

669
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,320
Right, yeah, with the health tips.

670
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,720
Now you sent them to me.

671
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,520
That's right. You would love Trucker Tom.

672
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,120
He's about your height.

673
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,080
You guys would look great together.

674
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,280
What was that?

675
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,360
Well, I'd love it once someone my height comes along.

676
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,720
I don't know. I'm sorry.

677
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,560
I don't take it the wrong way.

678
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,000
Sounds a bit, uh, I don't know.

679
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,960
Humiliated.

680
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,920
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

681
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,000
Didn't mean, oh, I didn't mean that at all.

682
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
But he's a bit yours.

683
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,280
It's like, I'm a little person, or no.

684
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,800
Okay, they came out the wrong way.

685
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,280
Exactly.

686
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,480
But first of all, you'd like him.

687
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,000
Okay, you'd like Trucker Tom.

688
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,520
Yeah.

689
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,320
You know, it's interesting.

690
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,360
He's about your height.

691
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,640
Oh, what do you mean?

692
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
Someone from Austria's speaking.

693
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,600
I've been a listener of the Delta Sierra Charlie for over a year now.

694
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,840
And I do, of course, have my own podcast, the ETW podcast,

695
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,160
echo tango Oscar Oscar, just search for that in iTunes.

696
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,200
Unfortunately, it's German, but I think your German speaking listeners

697
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,920
will have a great time listening to this podcast.

698
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,760
Now, what I'd like to say is, um, please add and get out of my head.

699
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,560
You know that sound?

700
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,680
Every time I hear that sound, I immediately think of the daily source code.

701
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,800
And lately, it's been getting worse when somebody next to me a little cigarette,

702
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,160
you know, with that sound.

703
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,840
I said, actually, another partial podcast.

704
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,800
It's basically, you're just like you doing your outro of the show.

705
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,480
And so I'd like to be pro, uh, deprogram.

706
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,720
Could you do something about it, please?

707
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,600
I mean, it's, this stuff is messing around with my head.

708
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,080
And I can't bury any more. I'm sorry.

709
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:07,760
So this is allowing us to run from the ETW podcast, echo tango Oscar Oscar signing off.

710
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,560
And, uh, keep up the good work and please get out of my head.

711
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,800
For 20 Adam.

712
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,760
Do you have 420?

713
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,000
We gates then, my friends.

714
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,600
That's exactly what I wanted you to do.

715
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,640
I wanted you to say a few words to all of our German listeners.

716
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,840
Yeah.

717
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,160
Yeah.

718
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,640
Yeah.

719
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,840
I, I, I, I, I, I, uh, Adam.

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,200

00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,080
Chances.

726
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,640
It's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a moment.

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,800

Brains in the doits.

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,120
My brain.

731
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

732
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,920

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,040
Cubella.

736
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,240
It's, um, uh, occupied right now.

737
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,720
The set?

738
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,800
Yeah, beset with English.

739
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,280
Yes.

740
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,760
Yeah.

741
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,080
And it's, it's, it's, it's in there.

742
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,240
It's, it's, it's somewhere, it's somewhere, it's somewhere.

743
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,040
I don't know.

744
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
It's just before language.

745
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,280
Yeah.

746
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,560
It's in there.

747
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,280
But I'm talking about, and I understand everything.

748
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Yeah, I understand, uh, uh, yeah.

749

No, uh, excuse me.

753
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,720
That's constant.

754
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,600
It's acting.

755
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,080
That's the only German I really know is from the porn movies.

756
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,720
Don't say that.

757
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,120
Okay.

758
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,600
I'm sorry.

759
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,400
Yeah.

760
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,480
Well, dear, what's on the agenda for today?

Now first, I have to go and take my walk on the, on the down.

763
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,240
Right.

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,720
Love that.

765
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,080
And it's nice for them, too.

766
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,960
They're going to go with you.

767
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,440
Yeah.

768
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,320
They're going to do the walk.

769
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,480
Yeah.

770
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,920
So I do the walking with them.

771
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,480
Yeah.

772
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,760
And, uh, after that, we're going to discuss, uh, dinner.

773
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,320
Yes.

774
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,040
Very important.

775
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,600
Yeah, that's, uh, oh, it's very important for your parents.

776
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,000
And I, um, uh, let's look at, let's not forget to, um,

777
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,240
to call Christina's, uh, school.

778
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,880
Yes, let, let us, let us not forget.

779
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,200
Yeah.

780
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,320
Did you, did you cancel the car?

781
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,760
No, but I will.

782
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,320
Okay.

783
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,960
I don't know.

784
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,120
And hopefully she can go back to school tomorrow.

785
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,280
Yes.

786
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,240
She has a kidney infection.

787
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,480
Yes.

788
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,440
It's kind of bites.

789
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,920
Yeah.

790
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,720
I've got a, I've got a real stable of winners here.

791
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,120
There's some time that's happening.

792
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,280
Yeah.

793
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,520
Yeah.

794
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:15,760
Yeah.

795
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm going to do.

796
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:16,800
Yeah.

797
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,840
You're going to, uh,

798
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,080
a lot of, uh, bladder infections when you were.

799
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,400
Yeah.

800
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,080
No, that was, when I was much younger.

801
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,400
Yeah.

802
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,280
Between, like, told me that 17 and 22 had lots of bladder infections.

803
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,240
Yeah.

804
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,040
It was horrible.

805
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,040
Um, I was going to ask you something.

806
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,600
Um, they, they say that it starts a little bit.

807
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,960
When teenage, you start to, uh, to touch each other.

808
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,360
Yes.

809
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,560
To become sexually active.

810
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,920
I say that like that.

811
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,160
Yeah.

812
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,280
Um, you're talking to a, a father of a teenage child.

813
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,240
Yeah.

814
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,880
I know.

815
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,400
Tough to even fathom all that crap.

816
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,040
Oh, no.

817
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,920
Um, I was going to say something else about your parents.

818
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,240
Hmm.

819
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,240
Yeah.

820
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,640
You, you, you, you, you looked at me and said,

821
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,680
you're so nice to them.

822
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,040
You want to say?

823
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,920
No, well, no.

824
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,080
It was, uh, I'm good to my parents.

825
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,720
I don't remember.

826
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm very thankful for you.

827
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,320
I really don't remember.

828
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,360
They were good parents.

829
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,400
Well, there's still good parents.

830
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,560
Yeah.

831
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,560
Uh, that's why.

832
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:08,800
Yeah.

833
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,720
Now, I mean, when I was young,

834
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,120
I mean, I do remember them as very old,

835
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,480
fashion nice, you know, but they, they shape you and do it.

836
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,200
When, um, it came from school with her apron on.

837
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,760
With a cookies and you dad with this hat.

838
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,520
Did, did, did, did, did, did.

839
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
Hello, little white picket fence.

840
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,840
Very, little blue.

841
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,400
Yeah.

842
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,040
All right.

843
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,680
Um, okay.

844
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,880
I don't remember what I was going to say.

845
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,320
Oh, it was something about your parents.

846
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,880
I'm a parent.

847
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,280
Yeah.

848
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,240
Just in general.

849
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,880
Ah, no, that's matter.

850
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,360
Okay.

851
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,480
I don't have it all together today.

852
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,760
I got a lot of chips to do.

853
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,160
Yeah.

854
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,320
Yeah.

855
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,720
I'm just, you know.

856
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,120
Yeah.

857
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,120
You have a bit, uh, empty.

858
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,960
Maybe, maybe that's it.

859
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,520
Why?

860
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:49,920
This will help.

861
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,160
You remember this song, don't you?

862
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,640
Laura Clap.

863
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,600
Hey, hey sister on the source code.

864
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,760
I have a scene.

865
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,320
Just sent a bad decision.

866
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Hold on.

867
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,680
Quick to anticipate.

868
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,080
Which part of what she needs.

869
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,160
While she puts her fake eyelashes on.

870
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,800
Every morning, say, in reaction.

871
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,080
Have the room set at its fashion.

872
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,320
Hey, hey sister, you can't let your head down.

873
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,320
You ain't done nothing bad and nothing else.

874
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
You feel so clear, babe.

875
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
You're just the pilot.

876
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,960
I don't remember what I was going to say.

877
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,720
This crazy life will live and it's all a part of what I was going to say.

878
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:06,400
She's under self attack.

879
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,040
Can't do this, can't do that.

880
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,000
Or she might lose her pressures.

881
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,040
Friends, watch your figure, watch your weight.

882
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,200
Clean out that empty blade.

883
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,320
Throw your know that in the way to live.

884
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,560
Look at you.

885
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,080
Time for so soon to let your eyes shine.

886
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,480
Listen, girl, pay close attention.

887
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Hey, hey sister, you can't let your head down.

888
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,600
You ain't done nothing bad and nothing else.

889
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,000
You feel so clear, babe.

890
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You're just the pilot.

891
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,480
I don't remember what I was going to say.

892
00:41:50,480 --> 00:42:17,440
This crazy life will live and it's all a part of what I was going to say.

893
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:33,520
Hey, hey sister, you can't let your head down.

894
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,560
You ain't done nothing bad and nothing else.

895
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
You feel so clear, babe.

896
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,720
You're just the pilot.

897
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,440
I don't remember what I was going to say.

898
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,880
This crazy life will live and it's all a part of what I was going to say.

899
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,560
This crazy life will live and it's all a part of what I was going to say.

900
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,200
Two.

901
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,160
You feel cool, girl.

902
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,600
Well, that's all I love it.

903
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,640
I love that if you notice that little piece of Hammond.

904
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,000
The, the, the, the, the B3 in there, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

905
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I was on the right, the right moment.

906
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,840
This is whole gang of pod save artists in in Tennessee and Laura claps from Tennessee as well.

907
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,560
It's good, isn't it?

908
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,600
Fantastic.

909
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,200
Yeah, I love it.

910
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,600
I love it.

911
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,360
Before we go, yeah.

912
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,680
Now you've been, you've had your station in your kitchen for how long now, like maybe six months,

913
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
four months, five months, your computer, your eye Mac,

914
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,880
Okay, so you've been emailing and you've been using Skype a lot, Skype out, which is pretty cool.

915
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah.

916
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,880
Now, what is the thing you hate the most about what happens?

917
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,680
I mean, what, what are the things that you've experienced?

918
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,320
But they won my password over and over and over.

919
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
Right, right, that's for your email.

920
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,760
Yep, for your email, yeah.

921
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,960
I don't, I don't like that.

922
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,200
Yeah.

923
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,160
And well, sometimes is your, your mail is not coming.

924
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,200
Mm-hmm.

925
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,160
That's stuck.

926
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,520
Yeah, or spam, have you gotten spam, spam, spam, spam, spam?

927
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,240
You hate the spam?

928
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh, oh yeah.

929
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,600
So here's what I was considering.

930
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,800
Mm-hmm.

931
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,080
Now we can't get the actual.

932
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,800
Yeah, gra.

933
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,640
I'm going to feed gra constantly.

934
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,840
Don't throw those out.

935
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,160
Save them.

936
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,480
So I can set that's why you long time.

937
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,040
Yeah.

938
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,120
And then, and those, uh, penis, uh, extenders, and I don't know what.

939
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,160
What is that?

940
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,120
Yeah, I do.

941
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,760
I get them.

942
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,720
Do you get them, too?

943
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,120
Well, I don't.

944
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,720
I don't even have a penis.

945
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,320
Because I'm using Earthlink.

946
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,560
And Earthlink, as you know, has the, uh, has some, some awesome spam filters.

947
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,280
Mm-hmm.

948
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,640
That cuts out all of that stuff.

949
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,800
So I was considering switching your mailbox.

950
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,000
Could also that, you know, can't get the mail or password.

951
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,960
That's all crap, you know.

952
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,360
That's just some ISP shit that just isn't working, right?

953
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,000
Mm-hmm.

954
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,680
So you want me to change that to Earthlink?

955
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,320
Yeah.

956
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,680
Yeah, make it better for you.

957
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,640
Yeah, sure.

958
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,760
All right, so we'll do that.

959
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,960
Those guys have got it all together.

960
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,240
Check them out at Earthlink.net.

961
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,480
Thank you for just great idea.

962
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,440
Yeah, yeah.

963
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,240
Okay, baby.

964
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,560
Um, so it's going to be a funny week.

965
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,160
I'm not quite sure about tomorrow's show.

966
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,640
Because tomorrow I'm, uh, doing the demo and, uh,

967
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,480
having the meeting with the, uh, the CEO of British telecom,

968
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,680
we're told you Ben provide.

969
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:17,840
Yeah.

970
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,480
He's a Dutch guy.

971
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,440
Uh, I, uh, I think he's, I think he's, uh,

972
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,400
something with the BBC.

973
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,840
You had also, that's Thursday.

974
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,320
That's Thursday.

975
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,960
It's, uh, by the, it's BBC Scotland, I think.

976
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,920
They don't really?

977
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,400
Yeah, yeah, well, you know, we had, like, we have BBC London.

978
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:30,960
Yeah.

979
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,000
Uh, you've got the South Counties, which is, uh,

980
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,760
come out of Guildford University.

981
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,920
That's actually where I'm going to use the studio there.

982
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,800
So there's people in Scotland that you have Scotland matters.

983
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah.

984
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,160
Yeah.

985
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,040
And then Friday, something else is Friday.

986
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:45,680
Can't remember.

987
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,560
We have to be on Friday.

988
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,520
Friday if you have to pack.

989
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,720
Oh, no, I, I, I thought I was, uh, this time I had the,

990
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
oh, no, you're the automatic suitcase.

991
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,960
The automatic, the automatic, the packing and unpacking suitcase.

992
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,760
Of course.

993
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,240
Yeah.

994
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,600
Okay, baby.

995
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,360
So, uh, I'll let you go.

996
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,120
Okay.

997
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,320
All right, thank you.

998
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:02,800
Well, you were.

999
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,200
Thank you for pulling me through the show once again.

1000
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,360
Just, it takes a whole cup of tea.

1001
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,240
One cup, I know.

1002
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,800
It's one, it's one cup of tea, or since I, I want you to prefer.

1003
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,360
And, uh, I'll be back tomorrow.

1004
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,000
The show will probably be up later than normal, as I said,

1005
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,440
because, uh, what is that?

1006
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,320
That's my dad.

1007
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,400
What is he doing?

1008
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,600
He's hanging the numbers because we don't have a number on that.

1009
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,400
Oh, my God.

1010
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,240
And he said, do you have anything to do for me?

1011
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Please give me something to do.

1012
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,200
We haven't, and 80 year old with power tools in the house.

1013
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,040
He always wants to do something for us.

1014
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,920
I said, okay, hang the numbers on the door,

1015
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
because the mailman is so confused.

1016
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,560
Yeah, all right.

1017
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,120
All right, all right, all right.

1018
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,640
Funny. Well, it's the end of the show.

1019
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,280
It's the end of the show.

1020
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,920
Perfect timing.

1021
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,960
Okay, everybody quickly.

1022
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,720
Right, I'll, uh, see you tomorrow.

1023
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,920
All right, here on the daily source code.

1024
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,400
Bye, Hunter.
