Delta Sierra Charlie 3-7-8.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,460
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,460
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,460
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,460
I'm just happy that so many eaks have found a place where they can feel safe and secure,

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,460
and certainly not be friends by anyone large and muscular who may or may not be a professional wrestler.

10
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,460
Meanwhile, girls will know the Wursuit challenge besides looking at each other.

11
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
All the facts add to me are here.

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,440
Cause they may be an Navy cast in Google,

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,440
We got past time to rise and shine

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Just another day in this life for mine

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
And take a deep breath

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
My lungs still took a past

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
He's got to be a good day

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Wow!

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Because there has to be stretch out my arms

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
I sail out my worries

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
You've been aided

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,440
No end of the possibilities

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
These are mine

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
It fills my blood

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Yeah, my soul becomes cold

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,440
There's a swing from the firemen monster

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
And with time

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
I finally feel fine

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Days as it should be

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Of my own design

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
There's no alarm clock

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Need to when I'll rest, sleep and dream

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
Mind to cade in with them's arm

34
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
All that I need nine

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Truth to bad day

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
And I hunched to creep

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Because you can't have a good day

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Unless you believe

39
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Every day good and bad

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Hope you'll be around

41
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
So let's focus on listening

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
To the pockets

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Sounds a little bit higher

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,440
No one will talk about the bad day

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Oh my friend

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
All the facts out of me are here

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Then be next to jail

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
I'll go to jail

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Well, no, no, no, no way

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,440
No one talks about the bad day

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Oh my friend

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,440
All the facts out of me are here

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Then be next to jail, I'll go to jail

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Yeah

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Yeah

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
We're getting late

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
The sun finds a little rise

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
And the home shadows stretch out

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
But we're scared flies in

60
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Think we're in the boom

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Cooling the conversation

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Comcenting

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
The moment of meditation

64
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,440
The old days playing back in the mind

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,440
The whole of people in the faces in this moment of time

66
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
The summer

67
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Wearing smiles on the spot

68
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
The wind and misery

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Because someone finds tomorrow

70
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
While others become history

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
And where do I put into my people

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
For all the artists

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
For all the stars

74
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Or the solar lights are darkness

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Could we be dumb as any of you

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Can be this hard

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Has learned about respect

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Between the close and the pharmacy

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
I mean the farmer

80
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
In the season of the harvest

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Or the solar seats

82
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,440
And I leave where the harvest

83
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Now everything

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Goody, man, won't be around

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
So let's focus on this

86
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,440
No, the bottom is not allowed

87
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Yeah

88
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
No, no, no

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,440

118
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,800
want to be remembered for anything. It's to have some association with this happening in

119
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,360
pod safe music. That would be it. This gives me so much joy. Hey everybody, it's the daily

120
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,400
source code coming to you from Curry Cottage. It's been a busy morning off to the dentist.

121
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,240
We'll talk about that a bit. Actually, I think we were pretty good show lined up today. I got

122
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,320
some good feedback, some good topics to discuss. Of course, a little bit of second life stuff

123
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,680
in there. Can't resist since we had him humongous party on the rooftop of Curry Castle last night.

124
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,800
And I'm so happy to report that I finally received my first

125
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,440
first car story from a listener. I told you about my my first real car, the Lansia or Lansia

126
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,440
or Nalsia, or whatever it should be. And I have another one, which is a pretty good story,

127
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,680
actually. Listen to it. Yeah, and this is Joel Ben from the thinking and driving podcast,

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
a thinking and driving dot com. You know, I'm just listening to the Charlie from

129
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:39,600
Thursday and apologies for not doing the number. But you were talking about your first car experience.

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:48,000
And I'm driving right now in my 2005 sign XA recording studio that I record the thinking and

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,320
driving in. And you know, I report my podcast while driving every day. And your story about

132
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:05,440
your your mess half with your front tires kind of reminded me of my first car first car. I named

133
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:15,920
Eddie was an 86 or an 87 Hyundai XL hatchback. This thing was like driving a tin can. I mean,

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:23,920
it just had no sound dampening. It was a real basically a lawnmower engine. And at the time,

135
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:31,200
I was freshly graduated from high school and was was entering my what I thought was going to be

136
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,240
my professional acting career. I was working at a theme park in Virginia called Kings Dominion.

137
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,520
It's a paramount park. And I was 18 years old and I got actually got a job working for Nickelodeon.

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:57,360
Which is a Viacom company. Great God Viacom. And my part was I worked in this slime bowl. It was

139
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,680
the Nickelodeon mega-mesomanian. I was a slimeologist. If you remember from early days of Nickelodeon,

140
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,400
everything was this green slime. And my part was a professor, Philbert Horachio, Petton Posh,

141
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,000
Limeology. And I'd spray paint my hair green. And we're a lab coat and basically make a big mess

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,600
up on stage and play with kids. It was a best job ever. But anyhow, I had this Hyundai XL hatchback,

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,080
grateful dead stickers all over the back and all kinds of stuff. So, you know, it was a total

144
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,960
little hippie car. Well, I'm driving home from work. My hair is spray painted green. And I'm driving

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,560
maybe pulling, you know, 60 miles an hour in a 55 and this comp pulls me over. And for those

146
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,080
of you in Virginia, you know how, you know, the attitude of the cops. They're a big good old boy

147
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,520
thing. And he pulls me over. And as it's, he's the professors there, probably. Because, well,

148
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,200
aside pulling out of the, the mutant park there, you got the bears on the back, you're window.

149
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,400
So, I know you got weed or drugs or guns or something in your car. So, go ahead and tell me where it

150
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,360
is and on, you know, there won't be any problem. I said, well, you know, I'm sorry, you know,

151
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm coming from work. I don't have anything in my car. He goes, I saw those bears in the back,

152
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,400
your car. And that means you got weed. So, tell me where it is. And I said, well, you know,

153
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,520
you won't find anything in my car. And he grabs me and says, you just implied permission for me to

154
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,600
check your car. So, he puts me in his, in his cruiser, he calls in the back up two other people

155
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,520
show up and to other cops. They're digging through my car. I'm pissed off, you know, I, you know,

156
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:46,640
a total of use of power. Anyway, I had a baggy in my glove box full of green tea because I was a

157
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:54,720
big tea drink right at that time. It was, if I remember correctly, the, the leaves were dried and they

158
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,360
were twisted and these little knots. I mean, you know, totally look like bud. And so he comes over to

159
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,520
me and he says, I found this in your car. So, how did you take this stuff? And I looked

160
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,200
on straight in the eye and said, well, officer, usually I put a little bit of cream and sugar in.

161
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,120
So, that was, he, he was, none too surprised about that. There, none too happy with that. But there

162
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,640
wasn't anything in my car. I could get in trouble. So, uh, pulling up to a traffic circle here. So,

163
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,320
that was my story of, one of my stories about my very first car Eddie, my, my little hatchback.

164
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,120
Needless to say, I've upgraded my car a little bit since then. You know, I, I've been recording

165
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:49,040
a podcast for, you know, a little over a year and a half. And just thank you for bringing that

166
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,240
memory back to mind. I was phenomenal. So, anyhow, just like to say, say to everybody out there,

167
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,440
don't think and drive, leave that up to me thinking and driving.com. Thanks, Adam.

168
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,800
I do great story. I'd love to know how I was listening to that. I made me think of my own story

169
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,720
with the weed and the authorities. By the way, portions of this podcast are not family safe.

170
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,400
And other portions are brought to you by download with Heather and Janelle,

171
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:27,760
download.acubu.com. Go figure. In 2000s 2001, I had a fractional helicopter, a fractional ownership

172
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,960
helicopter company with a partner, a friend of mine. And we had this beautiful Augusta 109 E power.

173
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:40,160
It's a six passenger, two pilots, single pilot, IFR, autopilot, dual turbine engines,

174
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,440
flying limo, beautiful machine. And Ron was in Paris. And he was on a little tour of Europe

175
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,960
with his, with his bride, Marta. And if he did, I'll all come over to Paris. I know there's a

176
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,840
a small Helly port, just outside the, I don't know, the fourth quarter or something like that.

177
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,840
And I'll meet you there. So, I fly there with the Stu, who was our pilot at the time. I didn't

178
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,480
have a license myself. And I'm in the back. And I had my, my at the shade case with me, not caring anything.

179
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,640
But of course, you know, I've had stuff in the at the shade case. So we land, it's a very small little

180
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:20,240
Helly port. And there's Ron waiting for me. And next to Ron are two guys and a dog. So before I can

181
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,520
do anything, the two guys, the Jean-Dame and the dog, or, you know, we want to search the helicopter.

182
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,760
And like, yeah, go ahead, you know, fully aware that nothing's going on. Well, the dog takes one,

183
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,920
one with inside the chopper goes, I'm starting to bug it out. And my, and my, he loved my bag. Of

184
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,480
course, there was nothing in it. But he could, you know, the dog was spot on. And this French guy,

185
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,160
man, he was like, you're small drugs. I said, I don't know, I mean, you know, but not caring anything.

186
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,960
And he just kept on searching. And eventually I just left and nothing happened. But it was, it was

187
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,480
one of those moments, you know, that was just really funny, particularly when you know that you're cool.

188
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,120
Hey, feedback is much appreciated from y'all. We have voicemail numbers. I haven't figured out how to

189
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,040
put my personal reading on to it yet. So you'll get kind of a dry, leave your message, please.

190
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:18,000
In Jersey, 201-625-6357 or in the UK, 0206-7681-3753, that UK number is not as good as I wanted it to be.

191
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,360
Is it? Hi, out of my name is Laura. I'm a loyal listener from Southern California. And I'm calling

192
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,400
because I just heard that message that you got from the prison in Chino. And it cracked me up so much.

193
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:38,080
I've tiered rolling down my cheeks right now. That was so funny. So keep up to good work. And

194
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,320
it's been a pleasure. Take care, bye. All right. More from that collar,

195
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,240
Marc Yoshimotor Nemkov later on in today's Charlie. You know the artists.

196
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,120
You've heard the music.

197
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:09,200
For a way from you. But do you know what inspired this song?

198
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Hi, I'm Ed Roberts from the brand new looking out the window podcast and looking out the window.com.

199
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,840
Looking out the window peaks inside the musician studio to find out what inspired them to write their songs.

200
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,960
I was on a motorcycle trip through the Mississippi Delta.

201
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,520
You know, what's their song? And it was really actually therapeutic because it kind of got all that

202
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
junk. You know, up and out.

203
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,560
Came down in Nashville and this is about the girl that I had to leave behind.

204
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,600
It's an intimate look inside the music that makes their songs all the more meaningful.

205
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,840
Take a look at their inspiration. You just maybe inspire yourself.

206
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,840
You get the blues today. Want me to do the same thing. Just get rid of them.

207
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
Enjoy a lot.

208
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
Looking out the window podcast and looking out the window.com.

209
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,240
If you're a podsafe artist and want to get involved in the project, visit looking out the window.com

210
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,160
and look for the artists yet played link. Hope to see you there.

211
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,240
Excellent idea. Looking out the window podcast, another fantastic addition to the podsafe movement.

212
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,840
Again, when I die, please just credit me for that. That's all that I care about.

213
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,320
And of course, burn me to a crisp. And from the ashes, I want I want to be good daily.

214
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,440
So I want to picture of me tattooed on Madge Weinstein's ass with my ashes. Is that possible?

215
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,280
Hi Adams. This is Eric West with the beat, San Francisco, a podcast out of San Francisco

216
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:42,400
for gay, lesbian, transgender, etc. etc. etc. I'm a black gay man, living in San Francisco with a podcast

217
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:50,000
about just that. I wanted to thank you for your show number 372, in which you got all over Madge.

218
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,520
I agree with everything you said and would never consider you a bigot. I've been watching you since

219
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,040
your early days on MTV all the way through now, your podcast on Listen to Every Day. One comment I

220
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,880
did want to make is on your show being a daily show. And yeah, if you could keep it under 40 minutes,

221
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,440
it'd be great. My commute is less than 40 minutes. I'm a lucky person. I live and work in the same

222
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,000
city, not too far away from each other. Once again, thanks for your show. And if you get a chance,

223
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,840
come on over and listen to the beats in San Francisco. I only do it about once every week or week and a

224
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,240
half. Don't have a whole lot of time for it, but I'd love for you to hear it. Thanks a lot and keep

225
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,720
up the great work. Bye now. My here, yeah, I only get to do it once or once every week and a half

226
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,960
as well. Just too busy with podcasting. Okay, you may think I'm moving along really fast today,

227
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,520
but it's with a purpose because damn there's some good feedback. Dear Dear Adam Curry, this is your

228
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:53,600
fan, one trick pony. I'm just laying here on my bed, thinking about you. Because you see you

229
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,840
inadvertently maligned me on your April 21 show, the rant about Richard Show, and believe me,

230
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,880
all of us in the proudest fear are just thrilled that YouTube boys have made up, but please allow

231
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,600
me to correct some small misconceptions. Now, here's where the confusion started for me.

232
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,480
I really do like it when you're pissed off, and I really do like it when you go off in the rant,

233
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,280
and you're a one trick pony. That's what you do best. Give up all the rest. Okay,

234
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,280
give up the Florence Nightingale bit. Give up trying to be Howard Stern. Give up trying to be funny

235
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,560
and video because you're not. You're one trick and your one trick is good and stick to it.

236
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,000
And before you go any further, I did want to apologize for that. That was not fair,

237
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,560
and that was a direct attack that was unwarranted and based upon no proof at all. So I do apologize for

238
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:51,120
that. To magic in this case. Adam, I am one trick pony. I am a burlust dancer and a podcast

239
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,840
star extraordinaire. Less dancing. More Florence Nightingale bit. I think you're probably thinking

240
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,520
of my Florence Henderson routine. Now, I do understand you're encouraging Richard to continue his

241
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:09,040
one trick pony behavior. We love that, but can you please at least give some perhaps to the original

242
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:18,960
recipe. Otherwise, you are so in for a spanking, ponytail. So that is all I got to say except

243
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,720
there's one other way you can make it up to me, which is direct all your listeners to visit me

244
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:37,760
at onetrickpony.com. That's O&E, TRYCKPony.com. Man, I don't know. I actually considered not playing

245
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,840
that promo taking the spanking instead. Good morning, Adam. This is Logan from Southwest Florida.

246
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,640
I just got two listening to you Charlie from Friday. Well, this morning in my part, we're all

247
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,560
dealing with it, but I wanted to ask you a question. I know that you're a person who enjoys

248
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,560
a year, but I'm a few years older than you are and I just recently changed the job and changing

249
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,040
the job. I had to take the usual, you know, drug and alcohol tests. So that then I had to study

250
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,240
for the test and had to abstain for like a month and a half or so, which is really a pain in the

251
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:22,720
air. But anyway, what I would like to ask you, you know, you smoke. Who told you that?

252
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,560
So you require the employees of Pod Show to take a drug and alcohol test?

253
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,280
Dude, if I did that, we'd have no Pod Show. That would be a question.

254
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:46,080
Yeah, okay. Very much respect to you and your family. I enjoy it in listening since February.

255
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,600
Don't have any intentions starting on old podcasts, but I am a listener and my right time.

256
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:59,440
The only thing, buddy, is what someone do the best of the week of the Charlie. So people can

257
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,520
download and stay on Saturday and just all your highlights of the week. You know, maybe a

258
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,800
hour, hour to half long, but just raps it all up and cut that all the little thumbs.

259
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
We have no show left over.

260
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,720
That's a good idea, Logan. I like that a lot. That would be very cool, actually. But

261
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,800
be more than happy to highlight a best of, but you know, someone's going to have to do the work.

262
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,400
And I think that will be significant work. But yeah, you kidding me, that would be freaking

263
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,040
awesome to do that. Yeah, right on. Had a conversation with my dentist this morning about

264
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:44,080
smoking the old herb, because you know, I thought you didn't smoke tobacco. I said, you know,

265
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,920
who said anything about smoking tobacco? She said, ah, okay. So we had a pretty interesting

266
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,560
conversation about it. And she was pretty much on on my side of the fence, which I liked very much.

267
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,600
Okay. A little bit of talk now about second life. And I know I've been going on and on about this,

268
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,120
but since this thing is available for Windows and Mac, second life.com, you really should just check

269
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,360
it out because in five years, we will really know we will be using this type of architecture.

270
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:21,200
I believe for a lot of our day-to-day communication. And, well, you know, it's crack. Okay,

271
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,240
we all know it's crack right now. And what's happening is there's just fantastic world where

272
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,120
you have everything that you can imagine, you can make, you can dream up, but there's infrastructure

273
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:39,200
of money flow and land and ownership and rights and stuff like that. And I see so much opportunity.

274
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,040
And I don't necessarily see it as, oh, let's go all sitting a circle and listen to a podcast.

275
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,400
But once again, what happened last night, where I think we had at one point almost 50

276
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,400
different avatars, people, on the rooftop of Curry Castle, partying, I really got to figure

277
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,320
out how to how to play Podsake music. I got this box of free tunes and what's cool about it is

278
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,160
when I start playing it, everybody in proximity hears it. And if you walk away from it,

279
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,600
it actually gets softer and it's a stereo vibe. So if you are to the right of me, you'll hear it

280
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,600
in your left ear and vice versa on the left side. It's outrageously cool. You can dance,

281
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,200
you can chat, but then all of a sudden, all of a sudden, ladies and gentlemen, who should crash

282
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,920
the party? But Madge Weinstein, beautifully, beautifully animated as the bloated lesbian.

283
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:40,080
And so that was very funny, of course. But what I really, really liked is Kachia was there.

284
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,040
You know, Kachia, she has done all this great video work for us and does my headers on Curry.com.

285
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,040
She gives such great head there. And Madge says, hey, is that Kachia, the video chick from Holland?

286
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,480
And so they paired off and they went off into a separate corner and had a conversation. I mean,

287
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,000
that doesn't happen on just regular instant message systems. This was something extraordinarily

288
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:10,000
cool. In fact, I know that at least five people who were at the party got laid last night

289
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,760
in second life. And yes, that's an uneven number. But hey, it is second life.

290
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,600
He had a mispedient one from World House Radio, aka Desdinking on second life.

291
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,400
Ah, shoot. I'm not going to be able to play this whole Desdinking part for the sad light window

292
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,920
is just about the shot on us. Tonight, the big pod show, a music rewind coming up between nine

293
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,000
and ten. Marcus Couch brings you the best and pot-safe music from the best pot-safe music

294
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
podcasters. Make sure you stay tuned for that. Gilmour Day of the Dawn and Drew,

295
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,880
you used Radio and Pacific Coast Hillway before that. I'll be here tomorrow for you guys on

296
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Sirius 102 with the Chacha. Let's continue now with with PD or Des as I know him.

297
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,120
Just wanted to comment on second life again. It's amazing over the past three days. How much has

298
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,360
popped up around the capsule? It's kind of like one of those secluded beach places where it was

299
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:04,560
nice and clean and very quaint when it started. There's stuff everywhere. It's like a circus.

300
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,520
But anyway, I hope to see you on second life soon and hope you're construction there.

301
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,880
You got the best for a lot next year or a cast or you're going to build something on there,

302
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,760
maybe a high riser who knows what. There's the neighborhood has changed quite a bit.

303
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,600
But anyway, I'll see you online on second life. Bye-bye. Indeed, it has changed quite a bit.

304
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,320
And a note about that. Now, just as in first life, real life, you have to respect other people in

305
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,520
second life and none of my neighbors and all of a sudden I have sprouted quite a few, including

306
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,640
my good friend comic strip blogger with his lighthouse to the right who has not once dropped

307
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,840
by the castle because, as he says in the comments on credit.com, he didn't receive an invite.

308
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,120
So I did make sure to invite him because I think that people would really get a kick out

309
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:56,000
of meeting him at a party. But I have neighbors, people. So could you please do me favor and not

310
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,200
be flying through other people's castles and houses and messing about with their stuff and

311
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,960
sitting in their chairs and stuff? Otherwise, everyone has to lock their shit up and it's just

312
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,040
not, it's not cool. So a little bit of respect for the neighbors if you don't mind because

313
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,080
they actually did come and complain. They were cool about it, but it is a neighborhood and

314
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,680
it is kind of looking pretty gaudy. So if you wouldn't mind taking your crap with you,

315
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,040
your cages, your sex machines, gosh, there were some awesome stuff there this morning. I left the

316
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,040
the rotating pod show headphone headball above the castle. So it's a little more of a beacon and

317
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,200
you should be able to find it a curry castle just to go to the search command in second life.

318
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,360
Adam. Yeah. Hey, this is James from Naval Cast and Face the Music. Also known as Jimbo DeSoto

319
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,840
in second life. I want to thank you and curse you for introducing me to second life.

320
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,080
From the first day you described it, I knew I was only going to have to try at once to be addicted.

321
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,880
I even told a friend of mine to try it out and tell me about it because I knew if I tried it,

322
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,920
I wouldn't be able to stop. Well, I broke down about a week ago and now of course, I'm hooked.

323
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,320
I can see huge potential in second life. You know, it's not that far removed from podcasting.

324
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,880
I think that'll live happily together in the future. I can see after all both are based heavily

325
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,680
on user-generated content. You make it sound like it's all about sex. But I want to set the

326
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,200
record straight for all those listeners of yours that are thinking about. I don't care what you're

327
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,520
about to say next. At the end of the day, everything's about sex, okay? But it's all about

328
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,640
it really isn't. It's about life. After all, it's called second life, not second sex.

329
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,920
Everything that makes life interesting, exciting and fun will also be found in second life sooner

330
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,360
later. I'm a designer by nature and a code monkey by profession. So second life is like heaven.

331
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,360
The coolest part about second life to me is that you can build and design stuff and then

332
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,320
script those objects to do interesting things. Podshow definitely needs to buy an island and then

333
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,760
hire me to design some cool pod casting objects. Well, that's all I've got to say. See you in

334
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:05,600
world. Yeah, okay. I'm done with that. Totally messes with your head. Totally sets you up

335
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,000
differently than you'd expect. It's not really a game. It is interaction with other people. It is

336
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,440
very much like real life. Here's, now I've been on, you know, for a lot like 12, 13 days now.

337
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,200
Here's a couple of observations and some things that I really, that really I don't like about the

338
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,000
system. If you, so here it is. The first one is if you form a friendship with someone which is

339
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,960
essentially is like becoming, you know, you're both on each other's body list. You can at that point

340
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,160
be tracked by your friend and you can teleport to your friend no matter where they are in second life.

341
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,880
Now, that really takes a whole lot of respect because I have business meetings. Seriously, I'm

342
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,600
right now doing some interesting business stuff development in second life. We're not buying

343
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,200
an island, but you better believe we're buying something. You better believe we need much bigger

344
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,880
infrastructure for what I expect we can actually do with this. I mean, cheese. Think about, you know,

345
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,760
the pod safe music artist performing live and then being able to meet and greet them later.

346
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,600
You'll find the experiences almost as good as the real thing. Almost as good. Certainly, a heck of

347
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:19,680
a lot more convenient. So, you know, I've been in meetings, I've been other places when all of

348
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,200
sudden someone who's on my friends list drops right in, you know, and it's rude and you really

349
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,200
have to treat that with respect. So what I've done is I've cleaned up my friends list. Everyone who

350
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,880
added me as a friend, I've pretty much removed every single one of you. Not because I don't want to be

351
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,200
your buddy and hang out, but before I give away friendship, I have to know that I can get that

352
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,240
respect because the interruptions are not fun. And what I don't think is anywhere or something,

353
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,160
you know, I like to be in second life. I'd like to be able to listen to podcasts in there,

354
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,040
do my email in there, watch some video podcasts, maybe invite someone in if I see something cool.

355
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,920
It's a great way to share media by the way, particularly that song stuff, man. Just I click on the CD

356
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,800
that I have on my hand and everyone can hear it. You know, that's a very, very cool way to share

357
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,720
audio and the same can be done with the video because people have demonstrated that to me.

358
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,080
But I'd like to have like a cone of silence, you know, so I can just pull something down,

359
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,840
where no one can see me, no one can hear me, whatever I'm doing. And this is not about sex, by the way.

360
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,520
But of course, that would be an integrated part of the experience. But you know, because I can't

361
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,840
have sex now, you know, anyone can can just teleport down on me and take a picture, you know,

362
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,360
I'd be the laughing stock. I could just be spin, Martin posting that everywhere. No, no, no,

363
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,760
we're not going to, not going to. And so I'm completely

364
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:45,200
celibate. Second life, celibate, SLC, Sierra Lima, Charlie. Because of that, you know, so

365
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,720
it would be cool if there was some way of pulling down a cone of silence. So if you're not

366
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,200
on my friends list, you obviously can't track me. And then the I am's cranky. Oh, man.

367
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,960
There's just, and I don't, there's no way to shut them off. You either shut off every

368
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,600
all communications or you shut nothing off. And that's a real bummer. So, you know,

369
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,680
I just have I am's coming in all the time. It's okay. I'm learning to ignore them or respond

370
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,200
when it's appropriate. But, you know, if I don't respond, it's because I'm probably doing something

371
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,080
melts. And I am very, very excited to tell you that what we're doing. And it'll be under the

372
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,920
pod show banner. I think it's going to be just, it's going to fit perfectly with what we're doing.

373
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,360
And I hope we get lots more listeners coming in. Pod castes, of course, very welcome because

374
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,760
you guys are enthusiastic and you bring such an incredible network of people and music and entertainment

375
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,000
and fun. And I want to be able to, uh, bad of oops, hold on. I want to be able to encapsulate that

376
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,640
as it were, into something that anybody can, can really enjoy and experience. And also,

377
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,160
we'll, we'll help you learn. Okay. So, I'll keep you up the speed. I say within about 30 days,

378
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,520
we should have something up and running. I'm just not going to tell you where or what or how, but, um,

379
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,680
very, very excellent and exciting opportunities. Hi Adam. This is Doug from Grag Radio. I've got

380
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:19,040
a couple of thoughts on DSC 377. First of all, you gave a little bit of advice to the comic strip

381
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:25,120
blogger on how to tell a woman from a man in second life. Got to throw a thought out there for you,

382
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,800
bro. For many, many years, I've realized that I am probably the least qualified man to

383
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:40,000
dress myself. Okay. If you send me to the store to buy a suit, no problem. I'll come back with

384
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,920
something that looks so sharp. You could cut butter with it. But, anything less than a suit,

385
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,360
I have no clue whatsoever. I don't know what's hip. I don't know what looks good on me,

386
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,840
and to tell you the truth, it's kind of boring. So, I go with my wife, Susan. She's also my podcasting

387
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,600
partner, and you'll probably remember telling her how hot her voice was, a dozen episodes ago,

388
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,000
but that's feedback for a different day. The thing is, Susan can pick stuff out off the rack

389
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,640
that will look great on me, which never would have caught my eye. I just never would pull them off

390
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,320
the rack and think, hey, I'm going to try this on. I think women in general are much better

391
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:27,200
at dressing their man than their men are. The thing is, I've had a lot of gay friends in my life too,

392
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,960
and I got to say, I have as much fun going shopping with a gay man as I do, going shopping with my

393
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,400
wife, because they have that same talent. So, here's my thing. I'm a little worried that comic

394
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,800
strip blogger is going to use your shopping test as a litmus for whether a shopper is a woman or a

395
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,640
man. I just got to throw it out there. If you go shopping with a hot chick, and she's picking out

396
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,640
great stuff for herself and for you, well, you may be dealing with the horse of a different color

397
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,440
will call it, just a little warning. Alright, point number two, you've implied a couple of times

398
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,280
with your exploits in second life that's doing something to your brain. And I'm right there with you.

399
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,960
I'm really digging it. I signed up a few weeks ago, and it's just an incredible amount of fun,

400
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,040
and it's mind-bending in its own way. Here's what I think's going on. Now Susan and I talk about

401
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,320
metaphysics on our show quite a bit because it interests us. I think the second life is an excellent

402
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:36,080
tool in training your brain to accept the fact that whatever you conceive of can be made reality

403
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,920
with just the mere thought. Think about that a little bit. You decide you want to be a little

404
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:48,560
thinner, a little taller, you click a button, bam, it's true. What better training could there be

405
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,200
for your brain to bring your thoughts into reality? A couple of little side notes, by the way,

406
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,720
I can't find curry castle doing a search. I don't know if maybe your search fell off the edges

407
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,520
or if it just hasn't gone into effect yet, but I'd really like to do a fly by and check out the

408
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,720
construction efforts. Secondly, maybe I want one of those pod show t-shirts. Where do I get one?

409
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Maybe he could dance and one my way. I'm all over the place supporting the t-shirts, baby.

410
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,760
I'd be more than happy to be a walk-in billboard for pod show. After all it's done for me,

411
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:31,440
she bet. All right, if you get a chance, go listen to rock radio, g-r-ok, r-a-d-i-o. That's all for now.

412
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,200
For 20, brother. I'm out. For 20, my man. Hey, the t-shirts are on the rooftop. So just,

413
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,680
you should be able to find it in the fine command, search for curry and then space castle.

414
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,720
And there's a box of t-shirts right on the roof. Thanks to d-troll-up who put that together.

415
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,800
She made the box. She made the t-shirt. It's really fantastic. She was at the party last night as well.

416
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,000
And you can just open up the box and pull one out. So they're free for all and may you enjoy.

417
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,360
Number four, a chilled selection of their tracks from Wimble and Kiss.

418
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,080
And they're new. I'll be free and easy.

419
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,320
And previews and brand new tracks from their upcoming album.

420
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,840
What's in a blue moon?

421
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
You're free.

422
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Yeah, you're alive. You won't want to miss this.

423
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,400
So come on down to downtown Phoenix at the one place.

424
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,760
Also, before you, our Mr. Meba and novelty of DK Seduce.

425
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,280
And did I mention, it's free. So come out and enjoy.

426
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,120

00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Adults at tones of NGB.

428
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,000
Yep, I'm pretty sure that Angie's going to be one of the first people I know personally who will perform live

429
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,960
in second life. And wouldn't it be cool if I could provide a really nice club atmosphere,

430
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,720
cool, mellow place. We could customize it just for the occasion.

431
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,440
And I'm counting on you Angie to figure out how this stuff works. Okay.

432
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,800
Hey, by the way, that the start of the show, I used a bit from from the most recent rocket boom

433
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,040
who have now started with an Earthling campaign all week long Earthling commercials on rockadboom.com.

434
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,800
Well, worth looking at some good stuff. Well produced, I might say.

435
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,240
I might add. And for those of you looking for a great deal on a domain name,

436
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,200
do you know who the hell I am, dot com. Unfortunately, it's taken.

437
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,160
You can get a discount. You purchase a domain name for $6.95 just by using the code DSE Delta Sierra Charlie

438
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,920
three upon checkout. You'll get your domain name for a mere

439
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,280
$6.95. Hi, Adam. It's Glenn from the Zedeshone Cape Town, South African. I thought

440
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,800
it sounds engine or your comment regarding your Yanks versus Brits segment on your show.

441
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,320
Oh, wait a minute. Hold on a second. Let's do that differently then. Let's do it this way.

442
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,360
Let's do this. And now a word from our spine here. It's the Yanks versus the Brits.

443
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,840
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

444
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:49,600
They're just like you and me. It's the Yanks and the Brits. The Yanks versus the Brits.

445
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,360
Mind the gap. I had him with Glenn from the Zedeshone Cape Town South African. I thought

446
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,720
it sounds engine or your comment regarding your Yanks versus Brits segment on your show.

447
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,000
I've got to say that I'm with the Brits on this one. Being South African, although we have our own

448
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:13,200
cultural identity, we do follow mostly the European trends, although we cannot ignore the fact

449
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,480
that in some ways the Americans do have an influence on us. Well, a lot of our programming on TV

450
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,760
in the movies. We watch originates from the USA. Of course, there is something that the

451
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,880
rest of the world likes to mock the Americans about. I've been to the USA before in one thing that

452
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,760
it's me every time ago there was how nationalistic the Americans are. If it is an American,

453
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:47,120
it isn't good enough. Oh, dude. Whoa. That's a shot across the bow, my friend. Particularly

454
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,320
from someone coming from South Africa, I'm from the African's, but I don't know how it is.

455
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,000
Quite simply, I was quite surprised when Coldplay did very well, over there.

456
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,440
And come on man, English music has always done great in the states. We love it over there.

457
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,560
The thing is, uh, is the last layer to the alphabet. The rest of the world pronounced it as

458
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,240
state. Yeah, well, you know, that's just silly. Okay, Z is just dumb. It's not a zebra. It's a zebra.

459
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,360
Where does that come from? By the way, why is that different? Why do we say Z and you say Z? Could

460
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,840
someone please enlighten us? And we know about Z. But we're, uh, they only know it as Z. And

461
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,960
hearing Z, it just confuses them a lot. One thing I've noticed too, over the years, it's

462
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,360
how ignorant some Americans, as well as other foreigners are about South Africa or Africa for

463
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:39,920
that matter. Meach in the word Africa and connotations negative, although, uh, like poverty,

464
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,200
HIV AIDS, civil wars, etc, spring to mind. I think the funniest question that we get asked

465
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,080
is where the wild animals, like elephants, tigers, and lions, uh, romance streets. Whereas the reality

466
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,720
of that is that such animals are actually roaming in wildlife reserves around the country.

467
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,440
And, uh, where our cities are booming metropolis with skyscrapers, tall roads, suburbs, etc.

468
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,080
There are a lot of positives about South Africa and I think it's tough people to take some time

469
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:14,000
out of, to just to see them and see what a great country South Africa actually is as well as Africa.

470
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,960
Well, Adam, you said you wanted to come to Oz one day, but how about coming to Cape Town

471
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,120
and hooking up with a flatter under the peninsula? And instead of drafting dots, we can do a

472
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,760
lack of brine instead, or if you guys know it is a barbecue. Well, and before you come, you can take

473
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,320
a listen to the Zedesh Show at the Zedesh Show.com, so trust in iTunes, cheers.

474
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,920
Dude, if you said the Zedesh Show, you'd have more subscribers.

475
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,520
And I thanks, I appreciate it. Makes a lot of sense. But what you're saying about South Africa,

476
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,240
I live in Uganda as a child, not quite South Africa, but yeah, I wouldn't mind going back.

477
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,320
And people do have a wrong perception. It's like a rack, you know. I went to a rack and it was like

478
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,760
an eight-lane highway from, you know, all the way from Kuwait, from Kuwait to pass the board

479
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,760
all the way up to Baghdad, and you know, who knew, and you know, big universities and

480
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,600
used to be there, of course, and probably now most of them are closed, sadly.

481
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,160
And Thomas Vincent sent in a Gmail, just finished listening to Delta Sierra Charlie 377,

482
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,240
had to wonder, are you going to the Netherlands for your dentist visit? We all know the legendary

483
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:22,320
reputation of the British and dentistry. Thomas from Flagstaff. What is that all about? I think that

484
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,360
the dentist, I'll go to a British dentist right here in Gilbert. I think they're great. I think

485
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,360
they're very skilled. Patricia's getting some work done, and I'll be poor, but yeah, I think they're

486
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,000
really good. But I must say, just look at Tony Blair, man, why doesn't he have his teeth fixed?

487
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,840
It would really, really enhance a lot. I'm going in for some major work, but my problem is timing.

488
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,240
I need to have at least three weeks. All in one go to get it all done. I can't be flying off

489
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,520
to San Francisco. So desperately, desperately trying to schedule that one way or the other.

490
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,360
Give me more. If you got any more yanks versus the Brits, interested to hear what you have to say.

491
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:07,200
I had him. This is DJ Max. My podcast really isn't worth promoting. So I'll just say I'm from Toronto.

492
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,520
I just wanted to say happy national masturbation month to you and all your listeners.

493
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:20,640
Normally, I play songs related to the occasion on my online radio show, like beat it by Michael Jackson,

494
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,680
or I touch myself by the divine holes, or even that's the hold by Kim Mitchell.

495
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,240
But since the music industry frowns on getting free advertising, I can't play any of those songs

496
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,320
on my podcast. So I did a little search on the pod safe music network and I can't seem to find anything

497
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,800
that would be appropriate for the occasion. So I'm wondering if you or any listeners know of any songs

498
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:55,280
it would be appropriate to play during the month of May on a podcast. So if anybody has a song,

499
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,720
your own song or anything off the pod safe music network, maybe you can send me an email at

500
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:08,720
djmaxrl at gmail.com. Thanks. Oh, and since I spend quite a bit of money on gasix,

501
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:16,160
I think I have the right to say tailwinds. Hey, first of all, happy masturbation month to you, my friend.

502
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,440
I was not aware. I did not know this was an official holiday month that we of course need to

503
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,240
recognize. I do understand the problem with finding pod safe music for in that genre.

504
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm quite sure that there are people listening who will come up with something. If anyone,

505
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,200
if anyone has it in in Jeff Smith, we'll probably come up with some ditty. Dude, you have to put

506
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,240
together a collection of all the stuff you've done Jeff Smith. Okay, put it together. I'm sure it'll sell.

507
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,840
People just love this stuff to bits, literally. So I do have something that Mark Yoshimoto

508
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,640
Nemkov sent me from Pacific Coast, Hellway. It's a video and I'll make sure to put a link to the original

509
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,320
source into the show notes for today daily source code dot com. It's not entirely about masturbation

510
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,200
Well, my father says you nifty. It's not you put a photo layer and we both agree that

511
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:11,440
human rights abuses are unfair. You understand you're feeling and you're not afraid to share

512
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:20,560
and I think I could do something with your hair. You smell nice and you're groovy and we both like

513
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:29,360
foreign movies. My mother says you have that touch of glass. Well, I can see a shining future

514
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:35,280
where we'll die a log and nurture. But there's one last thing I feel I need to ask.

515
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,160
Do you take it in the ass? Do you take it in the ass?

516
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,840
Because you're beautiful and curvy, but I'm less than glad I've heard of you. There's no way

517
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:03,200
you and me are gonna last. Do you take it in the ass? Do you take it in the ass?

518
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,840
When it comes to brands you've got a bottom line to play the bottom. I'm afraid I'm gonna

519
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:17,280
have to take a pass. Well, you're adorable, reliable, but is you're in a spiral? That's the

520
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:24,160
information that I need. When you would do it, if you love me, if you're nervous, what about me?

521
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:36,560
You'll be able to control the death and speed. Do you take it in the ass? Do you take it in the ass?

522
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:44,880
Because I've ordered an shipment of the relevant equipment. I've got lubricant and

523
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:54,240
hoppers and some breaths. Do you take it in the ass? Do you take it in the ass?

524
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,960
If you need more information on this type of penetration, we can always take a course

525
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,600
for this class. You see, I'm not the kind of fella who can get up on the nail and no one

526
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,680
hit a little color in my sex. Well, how they fight just so happens that I've brought my

527
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:21,120
nails, wrap on and some meds, go a little height in the effect. Ready?

528
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:39,200
Do you take it in the ass? Do you take it in the ass? Do you take it in the ass? Do you take it in the ass?

529
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:46,960
Do you take it? Thank you very much Mark Yoshimoto. Look off, I'm looking at the video. Actually,

530
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,160
you heard the audio only. Wait until you see the video. It's fantastic. Where have these guys
