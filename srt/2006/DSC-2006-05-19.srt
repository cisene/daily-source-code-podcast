Delta Sierra Charlie, 3901.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I never met someone who hit a guy in the aisle like the way she came to me.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And my best defense could've told that she was looking back at me.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I never think everything will be.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I never think all I'm so sweet.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I think it better to new kids than just me and her.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And a two-car watch.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That she all knew we'll let you laugh at you.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Easy payment so much out.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is that another look and did you mean what you meant when I thought that you meant indefinitely?

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I can't figure out why it is that I know I'm sitting next to her.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I never think everything will be.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I never think all I'm so sweet.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think it better to new kids than just me and her.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And a two-car watch.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Magic, I knew, yeah, magic, magic.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's you made it time to die.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Whoa.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Can't you find her?

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Stand one down if you tell me she's me.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Whoa.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you tell me she's me.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Whoa.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thanks for the drink, but my boyfriend is right over there.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think it better to new kids than just me and her.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And a two-car watch.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Magic, I knew, magic, magic, magic.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's you made it time to die.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think it better to new kids than just me and her.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And a two-car watch.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Magic, I knew, magic, magic, magic.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's you made it time to die.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Whoa.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Magic, I knew, magic, magic, magic.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How American is that?

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Cool water's ban, two-car garage.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Man, that's loud.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Go.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, there you go.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
From the pod to the music network, of course.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
At music.com, every single song we play on the Carlos.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's now become the Carlos, by the way.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
From daily source code to DSC, you dealt with Shira to Charlie to Carlos.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why Carlos?

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because we have the Delta Shira Charlie.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
See.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I mean.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Every song that's played on daily source code becomes available for sale on the pod-sake music network.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
As we start to ramp that up and roll it out, of course, after we get permission from the artist.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So sometimes it takes a day or two longer than we like, but it's just an email thing.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And of course, you'll be able to, they've got a whole bunch of songs on the pod-sake music network.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What do you think?

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You like that?

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I like the bit.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I like the bit where the grill goes.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thanks for the drink, but my voice sounds.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I love the cowbell on it.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, that's huge.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, my gosh.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the lovely lady Patricia joins us for the Friday.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is my share, because I just did some vacuuming.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I like it.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's very sexy when you stick it up like that.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, really?

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, it's kind of bird nesty, but the whole idea of it.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think that's I started to sweat.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
First fire deer, you don't sweat.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You don't sweat.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, I don't sweat.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't like it.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Say it with me now.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm a lady.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm a lady.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm a lady.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm a lady.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm a lady.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm a lady.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm a lady.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't sweat.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't sweat a lot.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you kidding?

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You know, as big squads go, you sweat much less.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's true.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What is that?

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's my dad again.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's he doing?

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He's putting away the vacuum cleaner blood.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Your parents are so sweet.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, of course.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They really are.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Kidding they help.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You mean your dad comes in here.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And after the first day, he's like, I'm bored.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I need something to do.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Give me something to fix.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He can't stay down.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He can't stay down.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He can't stay down.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
His body is meaningless.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He just can't, you know, mean something.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He completely rearranged Christina's room yesterday.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He did the bed, you know, took stuff off.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What stuff in different places, completely redid her room.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Today they're both vacuum.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He's vacuuming.

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, put the bed in another direction.

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
She didn't have much space.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let me just let you know.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Excuse my, my lisping.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What's wrong?

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Because I don't have tea sounds.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So hot baby to stop with the no tea talk.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I love it very much.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But you just had, well, we talked about that.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You had a major dental work done.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, we have to make sure we repeat everything.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, I do have a piece of plastic, but that's even harder.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, with others, just general fake things.

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's only on the back molar.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So you don't really see it.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You just called it your Halloween teeth.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Really?

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's more you Halloween teeth.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're fucking fucking very much.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I actually fall down when I speak.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So that's nice.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Very charming.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So we're going on our trip tomorrow.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We'll be meeting lots of important people and luminance.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, that's nice with a piece of fur.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're going to be my trophy.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're supposed to be my trophy wife.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I can just see you know.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How come?

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Who's that?

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Who's that?

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He's black.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who's that?

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Who's that?

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Who's that?

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Who's that?

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Who's that?

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Who's that?

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who's that?

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Who's that?

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Who's that?

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Who's that?

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Who's that?

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Anyway, what I was going to say is that I'm going to ask the Jeff Smith to do some kind of

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jingle or announcement thing for you.

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Could you just give that door a whack on?

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think it's it's it's the it's the it is storming here yeah.

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No, I can't.

The show of course is coming to you for oh there she goes she's yes closed on.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The studio is secure.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, no it's coming.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,400
And everything is, as we like to say.

179
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
Windy.

180
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Stormy with the.

181
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Where my love and I, we're together.

Yeah.

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,080
Yeah.

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,720
Everyone is at home going like, yeah, keep saying it, keep saying it.

185
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,960
So I'm going to do it.

186
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,360
So I'm happy to have you on the show as usual.

187
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
And everyone else is, you're getting fan mail and comments.

188
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, check this one out.

189
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,040
Listen to this.

190
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,720
Adam, hi.

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
I thought to send you a quick audio comment for the Charlie.

192
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,440
Of course, this is your boyfriend podcast part, right?

193
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,720
OK.

194
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
OK.

195
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,520
Big brother.

196
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,320
It's just started over in the UK.

197
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,000
And it's a huge hit over here.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If you're anything like me, I absolutely cannot abide watching it.

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,080
It's really hate it.

200
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,680
Oh, I love it.

201
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
Well, actually, we always hated it.

202
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,760
Because in Holland, we didn't watch.

203
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,960
Well, no, that's not true.

204
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,880
The first season, because I was actually involved with that.

205
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
We were doing some of the bandwidth for the data market.

206
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,240
Yeah, but I didn't like it.

207
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
It's stupid.

208
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,520
It was originally called Golden Cage.

209
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,520
And interestingly enough, no, you were there from the beginning.

210
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Yeah.

211
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
OK.

212
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Let's listen to the podcast.

213
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,920
And I sort of love to hate it.

214
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,000
My wife's so absolutely loves it.

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And good mates.

216
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,080
My poor pinfield from the calm cast doesn't know whether it loves it or hate it.

217
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,640
Well, anyway, we hate some of my idea.

218
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,720
And we thought we would do the completely unofficial big brother podcast.

219
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
And it's had some great comments.

220
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
We recorded it last night.

221
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,520
Got it straight up.

222
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,600
And there's some comments on the blog there.

223
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,400
You can find it at podcast.pl.com.

224
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,640
And just one other thing.

225
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,920
Just bought some equipment recently.

226
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,520
And I am so chuffed with it.

227
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:40,880
Hang on.

228
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
I'll give you a clue.

229
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
This podcast is produced with the last episode.

230
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,920
Yeah.

231
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,080
It's a great piece of equipment.

232
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Really, really plays with it.

233
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,560
And that's just belted out through my entire office.

234
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Oh, dear.

235
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
OK.

236
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Well, anyway, podcast pool that come for the completely unofficial big brother podcast,

237
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
all the best.

238
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Bye-bye, man.

239
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
So I listen to this.

240
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
It's funny.

241
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,560
It's for adults who actually are quite successful professionals.

242
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Yeah.

243
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Sitting, you know, like lawyers.

244
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Sitting around and talking about all these different people.

245
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Exactly the way you and I would do that.

246
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I OK.

247
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Do you want me to set you up so you can hear it or you're not interested?

248
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Well, how can it be like big brother?

249
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
No, it's not.

250
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,400
No, it's about big brother.

251
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
No, no, no, no, no.

252
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,400
So after the show airs, then they sit down and they talk about it.

253
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Oh, they were talking.

254
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
About the people.

256
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Well, let's first mention a little bit who were in there.

257
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
So we know what it's all about.

258
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,400
So yesterday, and I'm a little bit pissed because I know y'all love me, but no.

259
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Well, no one called me.

260
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm up here.

261
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
You want my business?

262
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
You want my business?

263
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
No, I was not.

264
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Absolutely not.

265
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
About 10 minutes of our 10 minutes at the end of the program.

266
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm in second life.

267
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
You come up and say, oh, you won't believe what you missed.

268
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
What are you talking about?

269
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Yeah, I thought you knew.

270
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
No.

271
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Yeah.

272
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
OK. Well, I didn't know you were interested actually because you're

273
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Well, I definitely won't.

274
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Well, I definitely won't.

275
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Well, I definitely won't.

276
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I didn't think you had a patient for it.

277
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,400
So we were, they introduced themselves.

278
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
So they went into the house yesterday.

279
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
It's going to be a long hot summer of broth.

280
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Just give me a broth of broth.

281
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Just give me, don't go through all 10 of them.

282
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm not that interested.

283
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
No, no, but give me the ones you like.

284
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
You're pigs.

285
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Patricia's pigs.

286
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I love, of course, the homosexuals.

287
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
I mean, you need a good homosexual in there.

288
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Good gay guy.

289
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
So do they have a good gay guy?

290
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
So I have a couple of nice gay guys.

291
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
They have one there.

292
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
That's necessary.

293
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Yeah, but no.

294
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
No, you know that at end of all, they're actually sitting there and they have

295
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
to be eating and it's like, OK, what are we going to do?

296
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
What we need some good gay guys in there?

297
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
I think even, you know, these people were thinking about it.

298
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Because what's life without gay people?

299
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Nothing.

300
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
So Shabbas.

301
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
It's a dirty service.

302
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
That's the pocket poof.

303
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Never worked in his life.

304
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
But has never found love.

305
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
So that's going to be very interesting.

306
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
If you're locked up.

307
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Found love on.

308
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Then there's two ways.

309
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Also, very interesting is done.

310
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
And don hates people.

311
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Oh, that's good.

312
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You're in the right place.

313
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
She hates people.

314
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
She hates people.

315
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Show me a picture of Don.

316
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Show me what she looks like.

317
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Yeah.

318
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
But she has a wig on.

319
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
She does not really.

320
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
No wonder.

321
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
But she doesn't.

322
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
She has a wig on.

323
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
She's a complainer.

324
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
And she hates people.

325
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
She doesn't want to communicate it or nothing.

326
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Then.

327
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Very funny.

328
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh, then there is.

329
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Super, super, super gay guy.

330
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Oh, there's not just one.

331
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
You have a super funny gay guy and super gay guy.

332
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Super, super gay guy.

333
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I think I saw him in the paper.

334
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I thought he's going to be trouble.

335
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
He's gone to be trouble.

336
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
That's Richard.

337
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Uh-huh.

338
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
He even had it Canadian.

339
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Uh-huh.

340
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
And he's a muscle man.

341
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Uh-huh.

342
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
And he talks about sex all the time.

343
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
He loves it.

344
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
And he says, I'm going to show them.

345
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Every man in the house.

346
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm going to show them.

347
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,400
What's what, you know, what sex means.

348
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
So, and then there is a gorgeous guy, Mickey, who is a...

349
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Are you think he's gorgeous?

350
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Well, I don't think so, but...

351
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Why'd you say that?

352
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Well, that's what the girls say.

353
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
And that's what the presenter is.

354
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
You know, but I want to picture a pie approval.

355
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
He's not bad, Luke.

356
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
He's not bad, Luke.

357
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
He's not bad, Luke.

358
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
He's on the list.

359
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
But, you know, you write, you see right away that he likes himself.

360
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Oh, Luke.

361
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
So, that makes him help.

362
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Now, I don't do guys that they're like that.

363
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Twenty years old, dislike of ugly people.

364
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Oh, very nice.

365
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
He and that, that wig chick should get along fine together.

366
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Give me one more.

367
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Give me one more that you think is really good.

368
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Then there is Leah, a divorced mom, glamour model,

369
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,400
with the biggest tits from Great Britain.

370
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Mm-hmm.

371
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
She has a joke.

372
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
30 M.

373
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
She's a student.

374
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
30 M.

375
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm not interested.

376
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
She's not interested.

377
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
She's not interested.

378
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
How about the Tourette's guy?

379
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah, the Tourette guy.

380
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
How is he?

381
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
They already say that he's going to win.

382
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Really?

383
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Yeah.

384
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
So, what was he like?

385
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
What kind of Tourette does he have?

386
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Does he say no?

387
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
No.

388
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I thought you saw it last night.

389
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, that was a bit...

390
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I switched it on a little bit too late.

391
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Because we were watching some festival, you know?

392
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Oh, man.

393
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
The Eurovision song contest.

394
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Oh, no.

395
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Yeah.

396
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
And my mom and dad were watching.

397
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
So, I became in from the kitchen.

398
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
And I was actually watching with them.

399
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
And then I thought, oh my god, big brother.

400
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
We gotta make sure people understand.

401
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Let's move on from Big Brother.

402
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,400
We'll listen to the unofficial Big Brother podcast.

403
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
And we'll watch it too.

404
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Yeah.

405
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm interested in the Tourette's guy.

406
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
As you know, being part of the Tourette Posse.

407
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Yeah, of course.

408
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Can you imagine a hip-hop group, the Tourette Posse?

409
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Fuck, motherfucker.

410
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Fuck.

411
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Oh, that would be great.

412
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
I don't see the picture.

413
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
Oh, you were easy.

414
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
You were easy.

415
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
So, Eurovision song contest.

416
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
If you don't know what this is, this is something

417
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
that has been going on for...

418
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I would say, what are they?

419
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Oh, it's beat.

420
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Beat is the Tourette guy.

421
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Yeah, from South London.

422
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Well, Pete has actually has a better chance of being successful

423
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
after Big Brother, whether he wins or not,

424
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
than anyone coming out of the Eurovision song contest.

425
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
This thing has been going on for 35 years, 40 years,

426
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
maybe, huh?

427
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Maybe even longer than that.

428
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Yeah.

429
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Maybe they're in their 50th year.

430
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
And the concept is...

431
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
It started as...

432
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
It was really...

433
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
I think it was a broadcast project to show...

434
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Oh, look, we're hooking up all these countries via satellite.

435
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Yes.

436
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
When it was a big...

437
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm sorry, go ahead.

438
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Yeah.

439
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
And David Bowie and I also...

440
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Oh, a name just dropped.

441
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Yeah.

442
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
We did song contest.

443
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
That was normal.

444
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
If you wanted to start...

445
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Then you did it...

446
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
You did your song contest.

447
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Yeah.

448
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
You wanted to be famous worldwide or something,

449
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
or European in Europe.

450
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
You had to do this.

451
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
You know, that was good for...

452
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
We're talking about 1970, something.

453
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Well, I was 19 when I did that one.

454
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
I was 17 when I did my first...

455
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
When I was 17...

456
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
It was a very good year.

457
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Yeah.

458
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
In Belgium.

459
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
In Belgium.

460
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
But wait a minute.

461
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Aren't you supposed to only perform for your own country?

462
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Yeah.

463
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I did for...

464
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Always for Holland, of course.

465
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
What we doing Belgium was the whole contest.

466
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
The contest was in...

467
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
It was very famous.

468
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Which means they won.

469
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
In high school.

470
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
It's a very famous place.

471
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Fly over it all the time.

472
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
It's gorgeous.

473
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Yeah.

474
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
So...

475
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
That was my first time.

476
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I was 17 years old.

477
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
But back in those days...

478
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
What did you get selected to be?

479
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Because this is the part that I'm trying to figure out.

480
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
They found you.

481
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Who's there?

482
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Who's there?

483
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Famous people from the...

484
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
No.

485
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Who is in charge of the selection for the Eurovision Song Contest?

486
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Well, most of the time you got somebody from the TV.

487
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
A...

488
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Well, so it's the broadcast companies that are in charge, basically.

489
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Yeah.

490
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
So somebody from TV.

491
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Very good.

492
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
One of the biggest...

493
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Management from Holland.

494
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Also, it was like an idol.

495
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
It was their judges.

496
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Yeah, judges.

497
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
All rounded judges.

498
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Yeah.

499
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
And records company.

500
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Somebody, you know, director of a record company.

501
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,400
You know, maybe producers.

502
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
And so they would select...

503
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Guys, a couple of six guys.

504
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Famous...

505
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Very important guys from Holland.

506
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,400
We'd say now, which is the best singer for the weekend.

507
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I disagree.

508
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
I disagree.

509
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
It's not about the best singer.

510
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
It's about the best song.

511
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I know.

512
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Okay.

513
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
So they always thought...

514
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
No, no, no, no, no.

515
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
I believe.

516
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Let me just correct you.

517
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Let's just make sure we're right on this.

518
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
They select the song.

519
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
And then usually the songwriter gets involved.

520
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Yeah.

521
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
And he helps choose who's going to sing that song.

522
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
The songwriter.

523
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
And then I was...

524
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
So what?

525
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
So what?

526
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
What do you think?

527
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Oh, crap.

528
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
See, exactly my point.

529
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
This is...

530
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
They would say this is a very interesting and...

531
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,400
A very talented, talented person that could be very big.

532
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
And she said...

533
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
I think you're wrong, huh?

534
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I'm sorry.

535
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I think it's about the song.

536
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Not about the performance.

537
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
You've only said in these days, I'm telling you that is one.

538
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
They would say that to you.

539
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Why wouldn't you bring the best...

540
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Of course, you would give the best performance.

541
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Okay.

542
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
So when did it change?

543
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,400
When did they go from choosing Patricia Pi to choosing the crap that every country seems to choose?

544
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Because nobody wants to go anymore.

545
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Because why?

546
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Isn't it a great exposure?

547
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Because you loseers now.

548
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Right.

549
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
There you go.

550
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
You're not all down from there.

551
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
After David Bowie.

552
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Right.

553
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Came to David Bowie, participated in the Eurovision Song Contest.

554
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
You ever hear him talking about...

555
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I know.

556
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
I don't know.

557
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
So...

558
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Well, that was in the Eurovision Song Contest.

559
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
No, I don't...

560
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
I was just telling you, Mom, yesterday.

561
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
That was...

562
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,400
That was exactly before his first release...

563
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
The Space Auditing.

564
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
For people who haven't heard that story,

565
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Do you want to tell it again?

566
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Because it was almost two years ago.

567
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Well, that was actually...

568
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
When we did that music contest.

569
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
That's when you did David Bowie.

570
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
That was in Mozart.

571
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Molta.

572
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
And...

573
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
No, I did not.

574
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
What are you saying?

575
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
No, no, no, no.

576
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
So we met there.

577
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
All these people from Germany.

578
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I don't know where.

579
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,400
And then you start to talk to each other.

580
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Because you're bored out of your skull sitting around doing nothing for a movie.

581
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
And you see already people choosing,

582
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh, that's a nice person to talk to.

583
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Or, you know, I can relate to that person.

584
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
And so you said the guy with two color eyes...

585
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
I was always...

586
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
And the white skin, he's nice to talk to.

587
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I was always very artistic and a very rocky kind of girl.

588
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
You know, I was always a little bit different than the rest.

589
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Ah, Han.

590
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
So you don't have to inform me of this.

591
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I'm quite aware.

592
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
And so was he.

593
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
So that attracts right away.

594
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Yeah.

595
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
You know?

596
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
So he was a bit of crazy.

597
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Crazy.

598
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
So you hooked up with David?

599
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
We were a little bit friends.

600
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Who then was not David Bowie?

601
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
No.

602
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
David Jones.

603
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
David Jones.

604
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
And so we had walks.

605
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,400
And sometimes we just had dinner together or set next to each other.

606
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
But we know when we...

607
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
He was always carrying around his guitar.

608
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Always.

609
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
And he...

610
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
His guitar.

611
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
His music.

612
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Yeah.

613
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
He always wants to sing.

614
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,400
And in these days he was just almost overflowing of, you know, all sorts of ideas.

615
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
And songs that he had in his head.

616
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Yeah.

617
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
So yeah.

618
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I think so.

619
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Yeah.

620
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,400
So we were walking on the beach.

621
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
And he was playing again.

622
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
We sat down.

623
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,400
And he said, I want to play you a couple of songs.

624
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Had you kissed at this point?

625
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
No, no, no, no, no.

626
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
I just wanted to get to the good part.

627
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
And he was...

628
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
I thought this was the good part.

629
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm not kidding.

630
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
He was playing that song over and over again.

631
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Whenever we were every time the same song.

632
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,400
And he was singing and strumming his guitar.

633
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
And he was singing, Graham couldn't play.

634
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Or to me, your tone.

635
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
You have to know Patricia.

636
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Yeah.

637
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
She was crying.

638
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
If I hit this song.

639
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Yeah.

640
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
So this was...

641
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
He hadn't written the whole song yet.

642
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
He was writing it on the beach, basically.

643
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Well, he just wrote it.

644
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
He just wrote that.

645
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,400
And then he said, don't you think I sound like John Lennon?

646
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
So I can just see, because I'm going like,

647
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Shut the fuck up with that ground control crowd.

648
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Said no.

649
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I don't think so.

650
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
You know, it's one of his biggest hits ever.

651
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Yeah.

652
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
I love that story.

653
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
He was doing it over and over and over.

654
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
And we can control the whole tune.

655
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Every time the same thing.

656
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I said, yeah, that's my latest.

657
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
And you thought it was shit, right?

658
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
What do you think of?

659
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I don't know.

660
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
So that was...

661
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,400
So it got the Patricia endorsement.

662
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,400
That song contest.

663
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
We all went home again.

664
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
And then his record was released.

665
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
And it was a big hit.

666
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Big hit.

667
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Yeah.

668
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Where was I?

669
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Oh, man.

670
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
That is so funny.

671
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah.

672
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
That is so funny.

673
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
And then there's some other stuff.

674
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
But I guess you're not interested in telling us that.

675
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
What?

676
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Yeah.

677
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Oh, yeah.

678
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Well, actually then we snogged a little bit.

679
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
And you know, like teenagers did.

680
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Wait a minute.

681
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Won't you guys...

682
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
In his hotel room and that Angie was at the door?

683
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
I mean, it was...

684
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
I'm listening.

685
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
I'm listening.

686
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Something was happening there in Malta.

687
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
And we were very nice.

688
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
This string.

689
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Just picked on me.

690
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
And I like it.

691
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
And suddenly suddenly he said,

692
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Oh.

693
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,400
My girlfriend is probably coming.

694
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
She's an American.

695
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
She's an American.

696
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
That's Angie.

697
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
And I didn't know that.

698
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
She said, but she wants to surprise me and come over and I thought,

699
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Oh, okay.

700
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Uh-huh.

701
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
That's a pity.

702
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
You know.

703
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Because, you know, we were very...

704
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
You need a friend if you were all lonely Malta.

705
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Yes.

706
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
So she came over.

707
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
And...

708
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
But hey, she said, yeah.

709
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Yeah. She said, she's very cool.

710
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
So we can...

711
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
We can have a...

712
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
A three-cent.

713
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Easy.

714
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Easy.

715
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
What's she had?

716
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
No, not at all.

717
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
And she...

718
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
And he added...

719
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Um...

720
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Oh, yeah.

721
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
And by the way, when she comes over,

722
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
you will see she looks like Barbara Streisand.

723
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Uh-huh.

724
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Compliment of all compliment.

725
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Oh, okay.

726
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Alrighty.

727
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Once she came over, I thought, well, you know.

728
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Well, alright.

729
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Yeah.

730
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Because when we saw David Bowie in Montro,

731
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
well, that was a long time ago.

732
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
But after that, when he came over for real,

733
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Can't go to do this, we...

734
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,400
You know, we got it on again, and we did it.

735
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
And you did it?

736
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Yeah, he's a fabulous lover.

737
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
He's a fabulous lover.

738
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Is he better than me?

739
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Just be honest?

740
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Yeah, he's a fabulous lover.

741
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Yeah, he's a fabulous lover.

742
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Is he better than me?

743
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Just be honest?

744
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Yeah, he's a fabulous lover.

745
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Is he better than me?

746
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
I remember.

747
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
No.

748
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
But I remember, Angie came in again.

749
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Oh, damn.

750
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Curse.

751
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
She was very jealous, and she was troubled.

752
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
She was just...

753
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Hmm.

754
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
But indeed, the only question.

755
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
But then again, if you're married, you shouldn't do that.

756
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
You know, that your wife is coming over.

757
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Yeah, really.

758
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
You know, in the hotel.

759
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Uh-huh.

760
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,400
But then later, I heard in one of the programs that he...

761
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Later, when he was in his marriage with Angie,

762
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
he did that a lot.

763
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Just, you know, slept around.

764
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Yeah, slept around.

765
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Yeah, it was the 70s.

766
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
And he...

767
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
You could do all that shit.

768
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,400
He caught a record with Lulu and I heard...

769
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
He did more than just caught a record with Lulu.

770
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,400
And he's saying one of the programs that just aired in Ray Britain.

771
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
And she...

772
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
And he came home and he said, you fucks her.

773
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Fuxelsing the serious stars 102.

774
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Have a great weekend.

775
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
We'll be back on Monday.

776
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
For to hear the rest of Patricia's David Bowie story.

777
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
No.

778
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
It's a daily source code.com.

779
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Take everybody this out.

780
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400
I went to his closing PCH's next.

781
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
And we had a little bit two nights ago.

782
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,400
And this is actually after the show that you said to me that I don't satisfy you enough.

783
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
You forgot.

784
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Oh, it's true.

785
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Okay.

787
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Thank you for gotten.

788
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Yeah, okay.

789
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Just...

790
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
No.

791
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Okay.

792
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Have you forgotten that evening?

793
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Day before yesterday.

794
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Yes.

795
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
So speaking of the Eurovision Song Contest.

796
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
We're in bed.

797
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
And we're...

798
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Because there's all this preamble on the BBC just doesn't...

799
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400
You know, all these flashbacks and lookbacks.

800
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,400
And every single public broadcast in Europe is doing this now.

801
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
And they had Brotherhood of Man.

802
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

803
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Kisses.

804
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Join me.

805
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Save all your kisses for me.

806
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
And of course, I'm a disjockey right.

807
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
So I go, it's a Brotherhood of Man.

808
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Everybody in my bed.

809
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
I said, there's not the Brotherhood of Man.

810
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
No.

811
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
And I said, oh, you want to put your money where your mouth is.

812
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Yes.

813
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
And I had to put my mouth.

814
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Where is it?

815
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
There.

816
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Can you tell that I won the bet?

817
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Yes.

818
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
You did.

819
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I was...

820
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I thought...

821
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
I thought...

822
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
I was right.

823
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
So just as a...

824
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
As a measure, just for the audience.

825
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Are you satisfied enough today?

826
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Is it okay?

827
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Yeah.

828
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm fine.

829
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Oh, I'm fine.

830
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Okay.

831
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
So just back to the Eurovision Song Contest really quickly.

832
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Yeah.

833
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I think that what all this proves is that democracy is mediocrity.

834
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,400
It's just everything that comes out of it is mediocre.

835
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
You know, it's...

836
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
It's because gone through so many committees.

837
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
And it's just...

838
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
It's lame.

839
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
It's so inspiring.

840
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,400
You know, girls allowed kind of group and they have sort of a...

841
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
You know, a boy group that...

842
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Yeah.

843
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah.

844
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
So bad.

845
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
So bad.

846
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
So...

847
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
The best part, of course, is Terry Woven, who does commentary.

848
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Oh, fantastic.

849
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I think he drinks like 10 pints of...

850
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
I don't know.

851
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
So...

852
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
So fun.

853
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
And we've got to comment from Holland, huh?

854
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Oh.

855
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Yeah, it's cool.

856
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Dear Adam and Patricia.

857
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
This is Ray from Holland.

858
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Adam, you know, I'm a big fan of yours.

859
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Although I'm not in the situation to listen every day.

860
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I really love to hear you on the Charlie, and especially the shows with Patricia.

861
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,400
You two really make it here to complete.

862
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Anyway.

863
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Last Wednesday, you were talking about all the burping and the sincere...

864
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Actually, you blamed it on the sincere, but...

865
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Come on, Adam.

866
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
You know better than that.

867
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Really dear Charlie, friends.

868
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Way back in the 80s even before the work-offing machines.

869
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Adam hosted the radio show in Holland on Friday night with...

870
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Do you remember this?

871
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I remember this.

872
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
I remember the moment.

873
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Okay.

874
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I'll let you tell the moment after he plays the segment.

875
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Well, I think three million listeners.

876
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,400
He was already doing these things on air.

877
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
It's not new.

878
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
He's just a boy with a big mouth.

879
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Burping on air.

880
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
When it was a dream, you had an Amsterdam.

881
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
You're doing it.

882
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
You're doing it.

883
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I was even better with the series.

884
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
I lived in California for the years.

885
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
The war didn't end.

886
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
It was really cool.

887
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
That was the video video.

888
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
M.C.

889
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
It was the M.C.

890
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
It was the M.C.

891
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
It's the middle.

892
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Yeah.

893
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
I don't know.

894
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
That was bad in these days.

895
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,400
This was 1984, I think, or 85.

896
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,400
There was only one popular radio station that was legal.

897
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
We both come this...

898
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Do they do that on the BBC right now?

899
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Burping?

900
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Yeah.

901
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Can Terry Burp?

902
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I don't think that doesn't fit with Terry.

903
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
But Chris Moiles, I'm sure.

904
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I'm sure we'd do that.

905
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,400
But in 84, I mean, there's just no way.

906
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
No way.

907
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
And so this was my co-host who was reading a story.

908
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
And then he couldn't find the words.

909
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
And I just...

910
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
I remember it.

911
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
I had this big gulp of coke.

912
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
And I went...

913
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
And then I immediately blamed him.

914
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

915
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Because it sounded like he did it.

916
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Yeah, and I remember I was in the car.

917
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Because we were having a secret affair at the time, right?

918
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
I know.

919
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I was driving to you to your house already.

920
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
You're like 180 in your poor.

921
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
When my poors, I had to park the car.

922
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
I was in shock.

923
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I wasn't sure.

924
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
I had to park the car.

925
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,400
And I was thinking, did I hear that well?

926
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
God, he was burping.

927
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,400
I couldn't believe it because that was...

928
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
That was no...

929
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Not done.

930
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Not done at all.

931
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
No.

932
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
No.

933
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
I've never...

934
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
And it was my...

935
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
The first time I heard it from...

936
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
I'm such a visionary, aren't I?

937
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
You are the first with everything.

938
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,400
And my boss at the time, Lex Harding, was on a boat.

939
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Right.

940
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
But he was on a boat when he heard it.

941
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
And he almost fell overboard.

942
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
But it was called you, right?

943
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Yeah, right in your heart.

944
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
I didn't even show you.

945
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Yeah.

946
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
He said, dude.

947
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
The red telephone was...

948
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Dude, not only can you not do that, but you almost got me really wet.

949
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
But that was it.

950
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
It was no problem.

951
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Yeah.

952
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
He was a guy who understood that he had to...

953
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
I had to park the car.

954
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Yeah.

955
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
That was awesome.

956
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
That's awesome.

957
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
That's awesome.

958
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
That's awesome.

959
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
That's awesome.

960
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,400
That's awesome.

961
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
That's awesome.

962
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
That's awesome.

963
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
But I tell you, he's back.

964
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Roger?

965
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Yeah?

966
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
He's back?

967
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Yeah.

968
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Yes.

969
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Yeah.

970
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
He's back.

971
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
He found me again.

972
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
I know he's back.

973
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
He's like a couple of...

974
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Yeah.

975
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Yeah.

976
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,400
get me very excited. I'd like to join in too when I'm listening to you banging away,

977
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,400
but this is a good list. The camp has very expensive and hard to buy. You can always try your

978
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,400
local dairy farms, see if they've got any old ones lying around, or maybe a music shop.

979
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,400
I don't know. If you live in a city, maybe you don't have any farms nearby, or maybe I've

980
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,400
been issued with a call or they'll keep me away from livestock. Then there isn't

981
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,400
you away. All you need is a can of baked beans, a can of cano cano in a plate.

982
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,400
I can of baked beans, open them up with a can opener, and then she's been from the plate.

983
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Then let's with a can that you can tap with a ballpoint pen, and it sounds just like a cowbell.

984
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:51,400
You can use any type of can really, not just beans. I could make the mistake though of the

985
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,400
human evaporated milk in a can would be or would be evaporated. Fortunately it wasn't.

986
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,400
So she's got an empty can, and there's not too resty, and she's got any shops there.

987
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Then you should be fine. Now let's go. So happy banging.

988
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,400
I want this.

989
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,400
No, no, that was baby. You can bang my box from Channel J Robin Bird Show.

990
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm very rude. I think I forgot to finish the Dutch guy's comment.

991
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I'm sorry.

992
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Hi, how are you doing?

993
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Have you ever done any of your apropos?

994
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Come on. You're watching a little bit of a link in this video.

995
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
No one understands this.

996
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Of course I am.

997
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,400
I know it was because of the brochish freaking del.

998
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Anyway, thanks and have a wonderful weekend. Bye.

999
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
And that's your song in the background.

1000
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Yeah, and yours.

1001
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Yeah, that's it.

1002
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
That's another story.

1003
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
That's another story.

1004
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,400
We have to explain, because that's actually very, that's a beautiful story.

1005
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
So we tell them, now we should know.

1006
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,400
We'll save that for when we're on the road together.

1007
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Now, do you want to do the show with me every day?

1008
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
I guess I have to, I'm there.

1009
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
But you don't have to, but sometimes we have to do it.

1010
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
We're there with so English.

1011
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Have to.

1012
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
You don't have to.

1013
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Don't have to.

1014
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Yes.

1015
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
You started to become a little bit English.

1016
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Yes.

1017
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Or have sexes.

1018
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Kids call the bill.

1019
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,400
The problem is, and when we go out west, west coast,

1020
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
we either have to do it late at night before we go to bed.

1021
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Or at the end of the day, basically, for the next day,

1022
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
which is kind of fun.

1023
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Maybe next time we should do it in the bed.

1024
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Maybe people want to come with us.

1025
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
And we record.

1026
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
You might want to, you might want to rephrase that.

1027
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
People want to come with us.

1028
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Yeah.

1029
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Come into the bed with us.

1030
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Come into the bed with us.

1031
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Yeah.

1032
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Dutch birth.

1033
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Who?

1034
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I do want to talk with you about Paul McCartney.

1035
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
But before we do that, I play the song.

1036
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Yeah.

1037
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
We'll talk about that in a second.

1038
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
I played a song Monday, I think.

1039
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,400
And I heard it on the Martina Butler Show, Emot Girl Talk.

1040
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Yeah.

1041
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
You have no idea.

1042
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
I mentioned the Christina.

1043
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I said, I'm getting all these comments about this one song.

1044
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
And she said, oh, yeah.

1045
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
I know this guy.

1046
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I don't know them for a long time.

1047
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,400
But listen to the comments that people are sending.

1048
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
If you know, mind, it's really cool.

1049
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Hey, Adam.

1050
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
This is Christian Philadelphia.

1051
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
And egoatepext.com.

1052
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm a listener.

1053
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
And I was delayed here.

1054
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,400
I'm going to work at death cancer study on the podcast.

1055
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Literally on the podcast, literally on the pod show.

1056
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
And you can get work on it.

1057
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Whatever.

1058
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Not done.

1059
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Not done.

1060
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
This makes me realize how big this is.

1061
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,400
This is the first artist that I've heard on the podcast.

1062
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,400
He's in that work that I've heard of before.

1063
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
He's following a podcast.

1064
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,400
And it's going to take off from here on out.

1065
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Every time you get one band on.

1066
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,400
They talked all their band friends.

1067
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
And you get 20 bands on.

1068
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Soon enough, you had the whole indie music scene on the

1069
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
podcast music network.

1070
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
So awesome.

1071
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
And keep to the work.

1072
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,400
So for some reason.

1073
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,400
The people now say the podcast music network is validated.

1074
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Excuse me.

1075
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Since so.

1076
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Because this is the podcast.

1077
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
What?

1078
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
I have to park the car.

1079
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Because you're burping.

1080
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
And I am sorry.

1081
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm sorry.

1082
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Because we just, you know, we were talking about it.

1083
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
And I had to park the car because you were burping.

1084
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Oh, sorry.

1085
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm sorry.

1086
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
No, it's the short term memory loss.

1087
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
It's the.

1088
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Yeah, you got that.

1089
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Uh-huh.

1090
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Yeah.

1091
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Dude, Adam, I'm sitting here listening to straightening on.

1092
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I had no idea that death cat for cutie had pod safe music.

1093
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
It just freaked me out.

1094
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
You hear that.

1095
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Such a good song.

1096
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I actually had it on my computer.

1097
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
It was making a thing about listening to music.

1098
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
But I just had to flip on the source code instead.

1099
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,400
By the way, this phone line is great for these impulse comments.

1100
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Thanks, Adam.

1101
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,400
So I want you to hear the song and tell me what you think about it.

1102
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Because I like it.

1103
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,400
But I was just blown away by, and this is maybe, you know, just 2% of all the stuff that

1104
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
people are sending about this particular song.

1105
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Deathcab for cutie.

1106
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Title and registration, please.

1107
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:28,400
The glove compartment is an accurate laying down.

1108
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,400
And everybody knows it.

1109
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,400
So I'm proposing.

1110
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,400
A swift orderly chant.

1111
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Because behind it's door.

1112
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,400
There's nothing to keep my fingers down.

1113
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:56,400
And all I find are soothing here's from better times before the clear.

1114
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Of your tail lights fading.

1115
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:20,400
To find yourself a better life.

1116
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:28,400
I was searching for some legal document.

1117
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
It's the laying deep down on the hood.

1118
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:42,400
When I stumble upon pictures I tried to forget.

1119
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:54,400
And that's how this idea was drilled into my head.

1120
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Because it's too important to stay the way.

1121
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,400
There's no plan for how our love did slowly fade.

1122
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
And now that it's common.

1123
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,400
It's like it wasn't there at all.

1124
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
And here I was.

1125
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,400
The disappointment ever went.

1126
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:44,400
It's like it wasn't there at all.

1127
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,400
There's no plan for how our love did slowly fade.

1128
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Now that it's common.

1129
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,400
It's like it wasn't there at all.

1130
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
And here I was.

1131
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,400
The disappointment ever went.

1132
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,400
The lie lying away.

1133
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,400
The lie lying away.

1134
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,400
The lie lying away.

1135
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,400
What do you think?

1136
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Yeah it's not your style I know.

1137
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Well.

1138
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,400
I liked it but I was missing, you know, the core or something.

1139
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Really?

1140
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
I don't want two, three.

1141
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Right.

1142
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
It's kind of like round control to me.

1143
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Yeah.

1144
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Yeah.

1145
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Before I got a whole bunch of things.

1146
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
You know what we always in Dutch say?

1147
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
No.

1148
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
We always say.

1149
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
And find you.

1150
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Well, you just did it.

1151
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
That is their hunt.

1152
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
That is their hunt.

1153
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
That's probably.

1154
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
That kind of sticks.

1155
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
And then I.

1156
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Tom the pod save music now.

1157
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Hey, a couple of things before I forget.

1158
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Voice mail numbers for your feedback.

1159
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Jersey 201-625-6357 in London, 0207-681-3753-3.

1160
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Congratulations to Marcus Couch.

1161
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Today is one year anniversary in podcasting.

1162
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Check them out at the scenes scene.

1163
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
He sent me this whole thing with a song.

1164
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
But I don't.

1165
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
We'd already agreed to do our show.

1166
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
So I can't play that.

1167
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,400
And I so much I wanted to talk to you about hunt.

1168
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
It's unbelievable.

1169
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Oh, I see.

1170
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,400
How much people sent me that link to the.

1171
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
You know, the guy.

1172
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
I told the story the other day on the show.

1173
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
The guy who was interviewed by the BBC, but he wasn't the expert.

1174
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Oh, that was so funny.

1175
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
I have the video of it.

1176
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Oh, really?

1177
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
You wanted to see just a little bit.

1178
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
It's it's hilarious.

1179
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Yeah.

1180
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
It's hilarious.

1181
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
You can see the minute he's introduced.

1182
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
The guy's like, you have to come over here.

1183
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
That's okay.

1184
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Just turn around.

1185
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
I should put the.

1186
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Put the sound system on.

1187
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Amazing.

1188
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Yeah.

1189
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
This is the guy.

1190
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
He was there for job interview.

1191
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,400
And they pulled him in for an interview about the Apple records versus Apple iTunes lawsuit.

1192
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
But I'm going round between Apple computer.

1193
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
The company behind the iPod and Apple.

1194
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
I just want you to see his face and the shit he talks.

1195
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
At the beginning of this interview.

1196
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
So this is on BBC News 24.

1197
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
And they pulled this.

1198
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,400
They pulled the wrong guy from the from the waiting room.

1199
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Instead of the in the expert who were there were going to interview.

1200
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
What about this lawsuit?

1201
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
As long as they pulled in this guy.

1202
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
And the minute they introduced his name.

1203
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
He figures out that they've got the wrong guy.

1204
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
And look at his face.

1205
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
He's still.

1206
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Okay.

1207
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
He's when the round started.

1208
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Well, the judge in the case as we've heard has just ruled in favor of Apple.

1209
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Call.

1210
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Time to record label.

1211
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,400
So what does this all mean for the industry and the gross.

1212
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
If music online.

1213
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Well, by Kumi is the editor of technology website.

1214
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
News.

1215
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Look at his face.

1216
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Hello.

1217
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,900
Good morning.

1218
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Well, you surprised by this verdict today.

1219
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,900
I'm very surprised to see this verdict too.

1220
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
To come on me.

1221
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
I was expecting that.

1222
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
When I came.

1223
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
I was a totally something else.

1224
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
And I'm coming.

1225
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
He's basically saying.

1226
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
I didn't know I was going to talk about the big surprise anyway.

1227
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,900
A big surprise.

1228
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
Yeah.

1229
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,900
Yeah.

1230
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
Yeah.

1231
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
It was a God to the costs and.

1232
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
So now he's just.

1233
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Now he's just.

1234
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,900
Now he's just.

1235
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
And he just keeps on going.

1236
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
But you know how that happened.

1237
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
And now we met.

1238
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Yeah.

1239
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
Now I already told the story.

1240
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
I already told about the stupid stupid.

1241
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Yeah.

1242
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Yeah.

1243
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900
Stupid producers.

1244
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Yeah.

1245
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
They don't have brain dead.

1246
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Even though what you're doing.

1247
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
All right.

1248
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Okay.

1249
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
Let's talk about.

1250
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
And I'll put the link in the show notes.

1251
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,900
Of course.

1252
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
All right.

1253
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
So Paul McCartney.

1254
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,900
And I'm a guy who will.

1255
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
Who will dispute this all the way through up until the.

1256
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Yeah, you do.

1257
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
I said it.

1258
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,900
You know, is because you read all this crap in the papers for about a week and a half.

1259
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,900
It's been going on.

1260
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
Yeah.

1261
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,900
And we read too many things about ourselves until I hear it from the guys mouth himself.

1262
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
I'm just not going to believe it.

1263
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
And now they've actually released the statement.

1264
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
I guess.

1265
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Yeah.

1266
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,900
That he and what's your name Heather Miller Mills.

1267
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Yeah.

1268
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Split up.

1269
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
You know, that.

1270
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
That right there is a clue that there was destined to end up in failure.

1271
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,900
Because she never went by Heather McCartney.

1272
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
She went by Heather Mills.

1273
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,900
No.

1274
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,900
No.

1275
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,900
Because she's somebody to.

1276
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Yeah.

1277
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,900
Like Patricia Puy versus.

1278
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
No.

1279
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,900
Not a dog.

1280
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Because I've always been Mrs. Curry in America.

1281
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,900
I've never.

1282
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
For the past two months.

1283
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,900
I think you've been saying to me, this is wrong.

1284
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
This is not going right.

1285
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,900
This is not going to work between these two.

1286
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,900
You were way before the papers were saying this.

1287
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
And it was just one moment.

1288
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,900
I saw one moment.

1289
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,900
They had a show about animal rights.

1290
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,900
And she does a lot for, you know, against for.

1291
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
And she had a whole show about it.

1292
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,900
And.

1293
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Yeah.

1294
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
And you're totally.

1295
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,900
Very interesting.

1296
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,900
I mean, I do agree in a lot of things.

1297
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
And they make for from dogs and cats.

1298
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
And that's ridiculous.

1299
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,900
I mean, that is absolutely ridiculous.

1300
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,900
So.

1301
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,900
Why did it.

1302
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,900
It's less ridiculous than from a mink.

1303
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
It's it's ridiculous.

1304
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,900
Anyway, we don't need it because the the fake is beautiful.

1305
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
Right.

1306
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,900
Beautiful.

1307
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,900
That can make it as beautiful.

1308
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,900
Even more beautiful.

1309
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,900
So.

1310
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,900
And they match nicely.

1311
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,900
Different.

1312
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,900
Right.

1313
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,900
What?

1314
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,900
And then the fake firm matches nicely with your teeth.

1315
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900
It does.

1316
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,400
Yes.

1317
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,400
So, but I was watching that and also Paul McCartney was in it.

1318
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
And I saw them.

1319
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
They were talking together about something.

1320
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
And she was explaining something.

1321
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,400
And she was.

1322
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
And she said, you know, we're going to do this.

1323
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
I'm going to do that.

1324
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
And my husband Paul.

1325
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,400
He has a lot of famous people that he knows.

1326
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
And they're going to help to.

1327
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
And a lot of relations.

1328
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Yeah.

1329
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
And and she looked at him.

1330
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Uh huh.

1331
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
And that was the moment.

1332
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
And I saw.

1333
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
Yes.

1334
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Uh.

1335
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Looking at her like, what the fuck is she saying?

1336
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I missed it.

1337
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Yeah.

1338
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
And really, I really.

1339
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
So he's like, I don't want to do this.

1340
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,400
You know, I'm all.

1341
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
That was the boy.

1342
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,400
Would you do it?

1343
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
But no.

1344
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
He doesn't like that.

1345
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
He doesn't like to, you know,

1346
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
get his, you know,

1347
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
use his friend.

1348
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Use his famous friend.

1349
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
You never see him in publicity.

1350
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Really.

1351
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
Except when he's with his women.

1352
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
His women always want to drag him into public.

1353
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
He is a very quiet person.

1354
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,400
And now I know that the marriage that he had with Linda was the most wonderful marriage.

1355
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,400
That's exactly the woman that he needed.

1356
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,400
And they were very, very extremely happy.

1357
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
And.

1358
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
And he was, you know, smoking is clear.

1359
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
And she was baking her.

1360
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,400
Um, a vegetarian meals and everything and cooking for him.

1361
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
And they, they loved it.

1362
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
They were never an hour without each other.

1363
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
I think the whole.

1364
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,400
The whole, the, the life that they had together was only nine days that it were apart.

1365
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
So it's a little bit like that.

1366
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
You would kill me if I was around.

1367
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
No, I want you gone.

1368
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Yeah, exactly.

1369
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Get him out.

1370
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
So.

1371
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Get that stinky sweaty man out.

1372
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
He depends on what kind of life you have, of course.

1373
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,400
But so, and then, and then,

1374
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
I saw him.

1375
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,400
Meals, you know, when he started to date her.

1376
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,400
And I thought, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1377
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,400
I can see that, you know, he's a sweet guy.

1378
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,400
He's a sweet man.

1379
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,400
And he already seen it.

1380
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Had it dated, done it.

1381
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,400
You know, actually it could have moved in here with me.

1382
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Yeah, really.

1383
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
You know, it would be the same as having me, huh?

1384
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
I'm just an old guy smoking a split.

1385
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Hangin out.

1386
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
Yeah.

1387
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Watching your cook.

1388
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
Yeah, Paul.

1389
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
I know what you mean.

1390
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,400
We did it all.

1391
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
Yeah.

1392
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,400
But, and she just wants to do her own thing.

1393
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
And it is.

1394
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,400
And then she probably wants to use him for that.

1395
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
And, and she does, and I think she means well.

1396
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,400
She's in for a rough ride.

1397
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,400
Now, man.

1398
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
But she's in for a rough ride.

1399
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
His kids didn't like her.

1400
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
They really tried.

1401
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Yeah, Stella.

1402
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,400
And I've heard a lot of famous friends from Paul.

1403
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
A couple of time mentioning.

1404
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,400
Hey, Paul.

1405
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Hey, Paul.

1406
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
Get the slagger out your life.

1407
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
And like, sir, Alton.

1408
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
You know, he has a big mouth.

1409
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Yeah, no kidding.

1410
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
And he was meant to say something nasty.

1411
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Heather, a couple of time.

1412
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
He said, it's a very cold cold woman.

1413
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
I don't like her.

1414
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
She's such a queen.

1415
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Yeah.

1416
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
Why does he do that?

1417
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
He's always into a thing with everybody.

1418
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Everybody.

1419
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Right.

1420
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
So knows.

1421
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
He has nothing to lose, I guess.

1422
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
No.

1423
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
He doesn't care.

1424
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
All right.

1425
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
So, so now everybody officially hates Heather.

1426
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,400
No, now they have a child.

1427
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Oh, but now they're.

1428
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
Yeah.

1429
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Especially.

1430
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
She's going to be.

1431
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
They have a kid together.

1432
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
Yeah.

1433
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
She's beautiful.

1434
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Yeah.

1435
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
That sucks.

1436
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
And they're married now for four years.

1437
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
And I think that everyone's going to hate her.

1438
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I'm going to look at her.

1439
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
Like, oh, you're going to take his money now.

1440
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
We hate you for more.

1441
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Yeah.

1442
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,400
But it's not real.

1443
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
I think it's the tabloids.

1444
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,400
They're really good.

1445
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,400
They feel good.

1446
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Yeah.

1447
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Yeah.

1448
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,400
And she just had another operation four weeks ago on her.

1449
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
Yeah.

1450
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,400
That was already going on.

1451
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Well, it's something messed up there.

1452
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
She works around so much.

1453
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
Yeah.

1454
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
She overdid the walking on her.

1455
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,400
You know, with her artificial leg.

1456
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,400
Yeah.

1457
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
And it started to hurt.

1458
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
No, no.

1459
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
I thought that the plate inside her.

1460
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,400
Yeah.

1461
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Also, and her knees started to hurt.

1462
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,400
That connects to the leg.

1463
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400
That it shifted or something.

1464
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
I saw her complaining in that documentary.

1465
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Well, no, shit.

1466
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
I would, I would be complaining.

1467
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Yeah.

1468
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,400
I can like that.

1469
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,400
Nothing to do with it.

1470
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
No, no, no.

1471
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,400
But still.

1472
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,400
He knew what her leg.

1473
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,400
So I guess the question is, did he, was this a rebound love that he jumped

1474
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
into this too quickly after Linda's death?

1475
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,400
No, I think he believed that he had, you know, he found another pal, another

1476
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
friend.

1477
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
But that's not what she is.

1478
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,400
He wants a pal.

1479
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,400
He wants a friend.

1480
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,400
He wants, you know, like we are.

1481
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
We're buddies.

1482
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Yes, we are.

1483
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
We're buddies.

1484
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
We need to buddy.

1485
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
And she's going the wrong way every time.

1486
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Every guy needs a buddy who will come into your office at 11 o'clock a night and say,

1487
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
it's okay, huh?

1488
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,400
You can play as on second life as long as you like.

1489
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,400
That's what every guy needs.

1490
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
As long as you play with me now and then.

1491
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
I satisfy you long time.

1492
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
All right.

1493
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
So I'm prepping this morning.

1494
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Going through my email, listening to voice mail comments.

1495
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
And the doorbell goes.

1496
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
Yeah.

1497
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
And I know I don't have to go and get it because there's no.

1498
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
There's a lot of people in the house now.

1499
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
You never pick up the phone.

1500
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,400
It's not for me.

1501
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
You never open to door.

1502
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,400
It's not for me.

1503
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
Yeah.

1504
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
What, what do you, you lost for you?

1505
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,400
Well, in this case.

1506
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Yeah.

1507
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,400
Right.

1508
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
So Patricia brings up this package.

1509
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,400
She says, are you a virgin flying club member?

1510
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
Yes.

1511
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
I have a package for you.

1512
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Yes.

1513
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
So it was a special delivery.

1514
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,400
And in an, um, a beautiful, what is it?

1515
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Silver plated silver plated travel alarm clock?

1516
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,400
No, not silver plated.

1517
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,400
Yes, it is silver plated because the instructions said how to care for silver plating.

1518
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Oh.

1519
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
Silver baby.

1520
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
Well, it doesn't look good.

1521
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
No, no.

1522
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
I took off the plastic shielding.

1523
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
Oh, no.

1524
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
It looks better.

1525
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
Yeah.

1526
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Please put your fingers on it.

1527
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Make it on all messy.

1528
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Yeah.

1529
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Okay.

1530
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
That's the diamond.

1531
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
It's quite handsome.

1532
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,400
It's quite handsome.

1533
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,400
And accompanied by a letter from the CEO, the chief executive Steve Ridgeway, actually signed

1534
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
by him in a hurry.

1535
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
I'm sure you had to send it.

1536
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
A shit lover.

1537
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,400
But writing personally that, thank you personally for your huge contribution to

1538
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,400
Virgin Atlantic.

1539
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Let you know that during the last 12 months, you have managed to earn over 100

1540
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
tier points by flying with us.

1541
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
So I'm reading this to you.

1542
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
And essentially, what's kind of nice about this?

1543
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,400
Forget the alarm clock is I now get what they call a personal account executive,

1544
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,400
which means I have a special number and an email address.

1545
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,400
And through that, I can reach either Pauline Box or Morgan Morag Morton.

1546
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,400
And so these are my professionals.

1547
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,400
And they'll take everything I never have to, you know, I guess.

1548
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Oh, your fly bitch.

1549
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,400
It's like my fly.

1550
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
Yes, my fly bitch is.

1551
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
I don't know if Morgan's going to go my fly bitch.

1552
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,400
One moment, please.

1553
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,400
Yeah.

1554
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,400
I got my fly bitch.

1555
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Let me go text my fly bitch.

1556
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,400
Give me some points and two points.

1557
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,400
So I'm reading this to you into your mom and my phone rings.

1558
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,400
Yeah.

1559
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
And I pick up the phone.

1560
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
And it's hi.

1561
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,400
This is Pauline Box.

1562
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Did you just receive a letter?

1563
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
I'm like, god damn you guys are good at virgin.

1564
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,400
There is my fly bitch.

1565
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,400
And my fly.

1566
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,400
I got to tell her that next time.

1567
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,400
Yeah, cool.

1568
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,400
I guess the other day when I was booking our tickets to New York, you know,

1569
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,400
it was kind of complicated because I was trying to do miles plus money, you know, to save money,

1570
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
essentially because it's very expensive.

1571
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,400
And you know, everything was all confused as it turned out.

1572
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,400
And then when I was all done, then she says, you know, because you had this gold card line or whatever,

1573
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:39,400
the representative before I had the fly bitches says, is anything else you'd like me to look at?

1574
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,400
And I said, yeah, what do you think of my hair today?

1575
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
And it was like a silence.

1576
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,400
You go, I think of pardon because you repeat that.

1577
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,400
I got to record that shit when I call those people.

1578
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
I know you do that a lot.

1579
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,400
I love that.

1580
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
You confuse people with it.

1581
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
But you know, it changes their day.

1582
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,400
Doesn't it?

1583
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Well, it didn't get her, did she?

1584
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,400
Because she wasn't ready for it.

1585
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,400
But next time she, I'm bombing, I'm bombing big time.

1586
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
And you do that a lot.

1587
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
What bomb?

1588
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,400
No, we are serious talking to somebody, you know, having a serious conversation, which

1589
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
it may be very important for that moment.

1590
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,400
Give me an example.

1591
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,400
Give me an example.

1592
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,400
Give me an example.

1593
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,400
And people look at us like, no, that's not all about.

1594
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,400
Give me an example.

1595
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,400
No, I don't know.

1596
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,400
What important are you looking at a house and then, you know, lady,

1597
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,400
you know, from the real estate agents, just a dry person with papers on there.

1598
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,400
Oh, she was kind of dry.

1599
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
Yeah, I know.

1600
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
And then you could stupid.

1601
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,400
Well, what?

1602
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Like what?

1603
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,400
You're looking at a house and you say, oh, that's nice.

1604
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,400
I can hang you on the ceiling.

1605
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,400
I didn't say that.

1606
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,400
That's not stupid.

1607
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,400
That's a pretty good one, actually.

1608
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
I have to remember that.

1609
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,400
I have to use that line.

1610
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,400
And those ladies.

1611
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,400
Because he breaks the tension of the stupid dry person with the papers

1612
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,400
on the ceiling.

1613
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Sometimes I have to say, oh, he's only kidding.

1614
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,400
You know, but it's, it's, it's the way I talk.

1615
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
Yeah, I know.

1616
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
You okay?

1617
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
I don't know.

1618
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,400
I like them.

1619
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,400
It's not exactly why you said, this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.

1620
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
That's why I like you.

1621
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
I like those.

1622
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Just like.

1623
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,400
It's like no.

1624
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,400
We went from love to like.

1625
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,400
No.

1626
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,400
I've been downgraded.

1627
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
No, I mean, the remarks.

1628
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,400
I'm not saying I love the remarks, but I'm like him.

1629
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,400
I can, you know, laugh about them.

1630
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,400
You guys, I think else for us baby until we wrap up.

1631
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,400
Well, I'm already 52 minutes.

1632
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
Well, I don't like it when they're tired.

1633
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,400
I do this every single day.

1634
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,400
I do this every single day.

1635
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Oh, it's looking, you know, following me through the house.

1636
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,400
They are telling me what I, that's exactly what you don't this.

1637
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,400
They're like, they're like furbies that follow you around.

1638
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
And then when you point them towards each other, they go,

1639
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,400
let's do this.

1640
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
Let's do that.

1641
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
Have you did the bed yet?

1642
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Oh, God.

1643
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,400
They steer clear of me, boy.

1644
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,400
When I'm in my office, they're like, they tiptoe past.

1645
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,400
They're like, he's working.

1646
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,400
Don't disturb me.

1647
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,400
I'm in second life.

1648
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,400
You know, hanging out with people on the castle.

1649
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
And then he's working.

1650
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,400
Don't disturb me.

1651
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,400
That's what I saw.

1652
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,400
This week, would they be able to handle Christina for the next 10 days?

1653
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Sure.

1654
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Crikey, man.

1655
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,400
I don't know about that.

1656
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,400
That's going to be interesting.

1657
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Say the least.

1658
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Yeah.

1659
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Interesting.

1660
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,400
Well, I told her to be very, very nice.

1661
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,400
Well, your mom will give me a report, right?

1662
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,400
She'll give me an honest report.

1663
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,400
I told Christina, fundamental things in her life would change if I don't hear my mom.

1664
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,400
That's true.

1665
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,400
She will definitely kick her ass.

1666
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Oh, yes.

1667
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Yeah.

1668
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,400
I just don't want to get that call on an eight hour time dear friends of three in the morning.

1669
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,400
Yeah.

1670
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
Right.

1671
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,400
Yeah.

1672
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Okay.

1673
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
I'm going to call my mom.

1674
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
I'm going to pack.

1675
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
You pack.

1676
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,400
Oh, call my mom.

1677
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
I'm picking up Christina at school.

1678
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
Oh, I have to call.

1679
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,400
I got to go buy a new mobile with her.

1680
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Yeah.

1681
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,400
Because she's, how many mobiles has she now broken five?

1682
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Oh, so many.

1683
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
It's unbelievable.

1684
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Yeah.

1685
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,400
It's just unbelievable.

1686
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,400
I didn't do anything.

1687
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
I didn't do anything.

1688
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Yeah.

1689
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
There's kids.

1690
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
You know what they do.

1691
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
No, I don't.

1692
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,400
I'd like to know.

1693
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
It's unbelievable.

1694
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
It's unbelievable.

1695
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
I don't know.

1696
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Even the cheapest ass.

1697
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,400
No.

1698
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,400
It's unbelievable.

1699
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,400
Oh, man.

1700
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,400
Okay.

1701
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
I had another song.

1702
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,400
I'm not going to play it.

1703
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,400
Excuse me.

1704
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Oh.

1705
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Who should I play song?

1706
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,400
Yeah.

1707
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
One more.

1708
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
One more song.

1709
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
I heard this song.

1710
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,400
Someone sent me an email that CC Chapman played it on the accident hash.

1711
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Lee Colter.

1712
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
The Booty Voodoo.

1713
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Oh, man.

1714
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,400

00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
Oh, man.

1827
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Oh, man.

Oh, man.

1832
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,400
Oh, man.

1833
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,400
Oh, man.

1834
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Oh, man.

1835
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
Oh, man.

1836
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,400
Oh, man.

1837
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Oh, man.

1838
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,400
Oh, man.

1839
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Oh, man.

1840
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,400
Oh, man.

1841
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,400
Oh, man.

1842
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Oh, man.

1843
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
Oh, man.

1844
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Oh, man.

1845
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
Oh, man.

1846
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Oh, man.

1847
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,400
Oh, man.

1848
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,400
Oh, man.

1849
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Oh, man.

1850
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,400
Oh, man.

1851
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Oh, man.

1852
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,400
Oh, man.

1853
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,400
Oh, man.

1854
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,400
Oh, man.

1855
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,400
Oh, man.

00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,400
Oh, man.

1857
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Oh, man.

1858
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Oh, man.

1859
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,400
Oh, man.

1860
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,400

Oh, man.

1863
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,400
Oh, man.

1864
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,400
Oh, man.

1865
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,400
Oh, man.

1866
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,400
Oh, man.

1867
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Oh, man.

1868
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Oh, man.

1869
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
Oh, man.

1870
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Oh, man.

1871
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Oh, man.

1872
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,400
Oh, man.

1873
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,400
Oh, man.

1874
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,400
Oh, man.

1875
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,400
Oh, man.

1876
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,400
Oh, man.

1877
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:18,640
Oh, man.

1878
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,400
Oh, man.

1879
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Oh, man.

1880
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,400
Oh, man.

1881
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:21,900
Oh, man.

1882
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,900
You throw some cowbell in there, man. It's just rocks in.

1883
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,900
I bet it drives people crazy.

1884
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,900
Yeah, some people really do not like me doing that.

1885
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,900
Yeah.

1886
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,900
But a lot of people...

1887
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,900
You can see your face. You really can see that.

1888
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,900
I am enjoying myself.

1889
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,900
You can see the face with him.

1890
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,900
Bye, man.

1891
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,900
From Papotum, boom, boom.

1892
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,900
It was Robbie Williams, wasn't it?

1893
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,900
A little bit.

1894
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,900
Time to rock your body.

1895
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,900
That's good.

1896
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Yeah, there's no shit as perfect.

1897
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,900
If you have a good song, you always think,

1898
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,900
Do I know this?

1899
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
Do I know this song?

1900
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,900
Then it's a good song.

1901
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,900
All right, baby.

1902
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,900
So, Monday you'll join me for the show?

1903
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,900
Yeah.

1904
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,900
And then Tuesday, when we're new year...

1905
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,900
Our Monday, I don't know.

1906
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,900
It depends on you.

1907
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,900
You do it in the evening, right?

1908
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,900
Um...

1909
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,900
Because I meet...

1910
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,900
I think I meet my sister.

1911
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,900
Oh, she's gonna be in New York too.

1912
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,900
Oh, excellent.

1913
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,900
Well, Sunday night by the way.

1914
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,900
Marta has changed the tickets.

1915
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,900
We have tickets for Sunday night to...

1916
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,900
Julia Roberts on Broadway.

1917
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,900
Okay.

1918
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,900
That would be fun.

1919
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,900
Yeah. Good.

1920
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,900
You don't like that?

1921
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:15,900
Yeah, yeah.

1922
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,900
Well, I've heard some reviews.

1923
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,900
Uh-huh.

1924
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,900
Some say that it sucks.

1925
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,900
Yeah.

1926
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,900
And she sucks.

1927
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,900
Right.

1928
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,900
And some say it's brilliant.

1929
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,900
Perfect.

1930
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,900
So we'll do...

1931
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:26,900
Sunday evening after we get...

1932
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,900
Let's find out.

1933
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,900
After that, then we'll record Sunday evening.

1934
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,900
And then we'll have a show from Monday.

1935
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,900
And we'll do the review.

1936
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,900
If she sucks or not.

1937
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,900
And we are honest.

1938
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,900
Uh-huh.

1939
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,900
Some of us in the room are extremely honest.

1940
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,900
Yeah.

1941
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,900
Beyond the honesty.

1942
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,900
I love to do this.

1943
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,900
Yeah.

1944
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,900
And I love you.

1945
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,900
Well, thank you, Mr. Curry.

1946
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,900
I mean, I love you, baby.

1947
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,900
Okay.

1948
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,900
All right.

1949
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,900
Hey, Petrisha.

1950
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,900
How do we get weekend?

1951
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,900
Yeah. Thank you.

1952
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,900
Yeah.

1953
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,900
Shall I pack yours, too?

1954
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,900
Your suit case?

1955
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,900
Would you please?

1956
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,900
Would you mind just leave some space open for the gear?

1957
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,900
Because otherwise, you're going to do it.

1958
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,900
Last minute.

1959
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,900
Last minute.

1960
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,900
My end.

1961
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,900
I'm the last minute.

1962
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,900
My end.

1963
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,900
Yes.

1964
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,900
Me and me.

1965
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,900
Just leave room for the gear for the microphone, the mixer, and the compressor.

1966
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,900
Story of my life.

1967
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,900
I know.

1968
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,900
I have a great weekend to everybody.

1969
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,900
Love you, honey.

1970
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,900
Love you, too.

1971
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,900
Oh, shit.

1972
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,900
That was, that was poor.

1973
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,900
I have a great weekend to everybody.

1974
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,900
Love you, honey.

1975
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,900
I love you, honey.

1976
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,900
I love you, too.

1977
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,900

1978
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,900
Stick it in your ear.

00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,900
Get this pod cast and more great ones like it.
