00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Think Advertising sucks.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Think you can do better?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Pod Show and EarthLink are willing to put our money where your mouth is.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Listen to this podcast or go to adchelens.podshow.com to see how you can win big

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in the EarthLink make advertising better challenge.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And now, brothers, are reading from the book of Charlie.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Chapter 400.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And RSS was upon the face of the net.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And it was good.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then did Dave create the enclosure tag?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And it was very good.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And Adam looked upon the enclosures and commanded that they should move in an automatic

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
fashion onto the iPod which the prophet Steve of Cupertino had cast upon a land like white

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
grains of sand.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And the enclosures to look at him and say,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
yeah, right.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And so Adam did write the script that would compel the enclosures onto his pod of eye.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And it was good.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But Adam knew it could be better.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And so he cast his source code out onto the net and set onto developers

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
hardy upon my code that would me all be able to benefit from a better file

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
catcher and put onto eye powder.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And the developers did party on the code.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And the code was pretty good.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And the developers said upon to Adam,

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
send us content so we might test the code.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And so Adam sent them content on the first day in the second day and so forth.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And on the sixth and the seventh day he rested.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And yet still he called his content the daily source code.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And loaded the pod catchers go forth upon the net and use them to obtain the content

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and listen to it upon their computers.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And their CD players and their iPods and their eye rivers and so on.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And thus the daily source code became the place where users and developers

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
party together.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And there was no need for transmitters.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And the people rose up and declared,

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
we don't need no sticking transmitters.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then did the users send their own content to Adam.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And some of it was good.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And the piloted state upon to the world with 16 million dollars of our planes

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
strapped to my ass and the next generation of radio content in my ears.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And so the daily source code grew.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And then Adam did drink of the secrets and sails.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And then did he belch upon the mic and invoke the names and sails.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And thus the people get the names and sails in their heads every time.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
One of their numbers burped up on the land.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And it came to pass that Adam did call his old friend Ron

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and get a field gang together and create pod show.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And the daily source code continued to grow.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And in growing its name the shrink.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And it became known as the DSC.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And in the language of the tribe of the pilots.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It was called the Delta and Sierra and Charlie.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And the people who had the iPod known as the shuffle did cry out and sound

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to Adam.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Who is us?

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Or we do not know which episode we are listening to.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Since we lacked the display upon which to read a file name.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And thus did Adam count the number of the Delta Sierra Charlie at the beginning of the show.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And it was good.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And then did Patricia and Christina visit upon the Charlie.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And it was even better.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And Ron and Adam gathered the content and the hosts and their shows from all the corners of the net.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And put them upon the pod show network.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I put silly ads upon them.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And it was good.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But the ads were bad.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And so the users created their own ads.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then it was good.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And the people who were busy and liked the abbreviations called upon Adam.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And it referring to his show they called it the Charlie or the Jia Jia or the Carlos.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then the counting of the Charlie reached 20 score minus 1.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And seeing that the Charlie would reach the milestone of 20 score or 390 and 9 and 1 more.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Did I create this program to celebrate the anniversary of the Daily Source code?

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And thus did I scan the way to be the one to say Delta Sierra Charlie or zero zero.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And it was good.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We don't need lost thinking turns, man.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm testing this battle curry.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, where you're gonna go?

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now that's so town's gone.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How you're gonna do?

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What has been so one done?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What you're gonna hit right at that tip?

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The Larry essence of cool.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In streets I didn't fly.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I still ain't your eye.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
For you I know that it's true.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's my eye for the know.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What you're gonna say?

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
When they talk it down.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That I'd be covered today.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It wasn't nothing, nothing but a plane change.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You don't say so town's the way it's on.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That it be.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And someday we'll build it all again.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
When we've had enough of this empty day.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The fact you murdered this holy man

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
will start a fresh crazy event.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When you're gonna see that so town's dead.

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When you're gonna see that so town's dead.

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And all those beautiful people you used to know.

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well they ain't so fair.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When you're right at high.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're new for the skies.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Just being like once you're grown.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
With one bringing your heart something that came.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You thought that you'd better change in the world.

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You'll say so town's the way it is.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But it makes you new.

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Some day we'll build it all again.

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
When we've had enough of this empty day.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The fact you murdered this holy man will start a fresh crazy event.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well they ain't so fair.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
When you're gonna see that so town's dead.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now that's so town's gone.

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When you're gonna see that so town's dead.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Just being like once you're grown.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Just being like once you're grown.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm talking about so town's dead.

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Because so town's gone.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But there's those crazy clothes to guess the way.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Flows in your head.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And your peace sides everywhere.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They don't back in so town's dead.

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Nobody's telling what happened.

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
All those dreams are peaceful.

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And understand it and hide it.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And rub it.

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Now I want to be in the game.

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Have I ever heard of it?

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't let see this old town.

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Showtime which is born.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're not the one.

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're not the one.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Just being like once you're grown.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Just being like once you're grown.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Just being like once you're grown.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Just being like once you're grown.

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Just being like once you're grown.

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's for mellow start of your Charlie.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
After all the show is 400.

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How are you doing everybody?

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It is Delta Sierra Charlie.

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Daily source code episode number 400 coming to you from the Curry Cottage in the

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
affluent suburb of Seri known as Gilford.

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And kicking it off was a long song.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That was long.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I finished my sense sale before the song was even over.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sure I'm bordering this.

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Anabule is what I'm going to say.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
From the podcast music network reading from his bio.

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Ola.

157
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's considered to be the UK's finest sold singer songwriters and performs over 100

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
shows a year in the UK island in Europe.

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He's emerged as an artist of distinction.

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Honing is writing in production skills at the same time evolving into a passionate

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and committed performer.

162
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't know man.

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sounded like Michael McDonald to me, but I liked it.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And thank you very much Howard Greenstein for the opening there of number 400.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That was also long.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Those two combined really helped us and say oh intake.

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I just wanted to mention that Howard's nephew Sawyer is in hospital recovering from a spinal injury.

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It has been able to move from the hips down for two and a half weeks and I quite sure what happened.

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He's 12 years old and it would be cool if you sent him a little message.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You can do that at getwellsoyer.com show notes will contain the link as always.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So I'm about on time today recording the show.

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And of course you could be listening to this on serious stars 102 or hopefully you're listening to it as a podcast.

173
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
400 episodes.

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you lay them all out back to back and you play this show every single day, seven days a week,

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
13 months I think is how long it would take for you to listen to every single one of them.

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And Patricia's like wow that's cool congratulations.

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What is 400?

178
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I wasn't going to do anything with people start sending me all this 400 show stuff, which I really appreciate of course.

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But yeah, it was like we did it at 100 and 200, which was nomed X and 250.

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can do it at 250, you can do it 400, you can do it five.

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Who cares?

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just the fact that you guys are listening and subscribe, that's all that I care about.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hey, as I'm leaf and portion fifth, just wanted to congratulate you on your 400 show.

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Long time childlessness since 1997.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I thought I sent you this feedback on Friday.

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So by the time I guess to choose day you should have catch up on all your GML and voice mouths.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
All right, cheers.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, was that the UK version of the lighter click?

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's your drug of choice.

190
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you very much, buddy.

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Adam, good morning.

192
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's you clocked, levy.

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, he's tired.

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Like, what am I like?

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Five minutes into TSC 399 and I just heard the Kabel song.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I've heard you mentioned me.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And the email that I sent, thank you so much.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And man, that pronunciation was unbelievable of my first name.

199
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm guessing that is a combination of you knowing Dutch and having that sound,

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and probably hearing my previous audio comes.

201
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't think you'd actually ever mentioned me on the show before,

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
but that sent you a couple of comments before.

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So you've obviously heard them.

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Appreciate that very much.

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Keep up the fantastic work.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I am super even more inspired now to really get that the podcast going.

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Keep it up and the best to Christina and Patricia and all of us.

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Pretty mom as well.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Thanks man.

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,500
Bye.

211
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,000
Alright, you've thought.

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yep.

213
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you met her back.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Start.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You've read.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You've thought.

217
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And yeah, I grew up growing up in the Netherlands.

218
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You get that sound, which is not a very pretty sound.

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But it is very distinct.

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And in fact, in the second world war,

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,500
it was often used to see if you were really one of the good guys.

222
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
A Dutch person would ask you to say groaning.

223
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Growning was really the one, which is a place in the north of the Netherlands.

224
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Kind of like the way the Yanks would say,

225
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
who won the World Series?

226
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,500
You know, to see if you were truly an American,

227
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
the Dutch youth sound check.

228
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
And you can tell.

229
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
You can tell if a German person does it because they do it a little bit differently.

230
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,500
And I would say probably Dutch and Yiddish are very close to each other.

231
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,500
But that's a very distinct sound.

232
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
So thank you very much for the voicemail.

233
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
If you want to send a message in,

234
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,500
we've got a number New Jersey 2016256357.

235
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Because you can take the boy out of Jersey,

236
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
but you can't take Jersey out of the boy.

237
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,500
And if you're in London, or if you're in Europe and want to use the London number,

238
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
although I think that even with Skype out,

239
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
you're going to find the Jersey numbers cheaper.

240
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,500
It's 02076813753.

241
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Put me in your phone.

242
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Okay, just put the number in.

243
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Here it is.

244
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,500
1216256357.

245
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Okay.

246
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Add to address books.

247
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
See?

248
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
That wasn't too hard.

249
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
No was it.

250
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,500
So I've maintained my presence on Windows,

251
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
although I've done a little more studying

252
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
as to what exactly the differences are between Mac.

253
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
And it's not just the OS, the operating system.

254
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
It's also the hardware itself.

255
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,500
And of course Apple has a great connection between the hardware and the operating system.

256
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,500
And many pieces of software because they really control a lot of those pieces of what

257
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
becomes a PC, a personal computer.

258
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,500
And of course with the Windows, there are different,

259
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
they're even different processors, of course.

260
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
You can use different versions.

261
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Got Intel and AMD.

262
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
It says it.

263
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Ah.

264
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,500
This is a moment brought to you by the Gilmore gang.

265
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
So what exactly are those differences?

266
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Well, let me tell you what.

267
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
First of all, before I even get into differences,

268
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
here's one thing I hate about Windows.

269
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
I hate it when you install a piece of software.

270
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,500
And it decides that it's going to become your default piece of software for particular file type.

271
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,500
And this happens most mainly with MP3s.

272
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Anything that you install or auto install,

273
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
thank you very much.

274
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Another thing I don't like about these PC manufacturers.

275
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
It auto installs.

276
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
You know, then all the icons change.

277
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
And yeah, you can set it back to,

278
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
oh, I like stuff opening in quick time.

279
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
I don't want things opening in iTunes.

280
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
And I certainly don't want stuff opening in the hell.

281
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Is this piece of crap?

282
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Hold on.

283
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Let me see.

284
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
What is it called?

285
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I thought it was open.

286
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Hold on.

287
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Let me see.

288
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
It is.

289
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
I see a piece of crap.

290
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I hate that.

291
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Music, melody, maintainer or something like that.

292
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
And it makes all the MP3 icons in a little stupid icon.

293
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
That I really dislike.

294
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Really dislike it.

295
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Ask me.

296
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Please ask me if you can be the default.

297
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Don't just do it.

298
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
So here's some really simple differences that I noticed.

299
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
First of all, the layout of the desktop.

300
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
And although it's very obvious.

301
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
And I'm sure you've seen this before.

302
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
And you, I don't know if we even talk about it anymore.

303
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,500
With a Mac, your hard drive or what on the windows would be.

304
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,500
My computer is located in the upper right hand corner of the screen.

305
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
On windows, it's on the upper left hand corner of the screen.

306
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
And your stuff starts building up left.

307
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Whereas on the Mac, it starts building up on the right.

308
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,500
So the most obvious change is to just shift that stuff over to the right.

309
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
And that's what I'm trained to do.

310
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm trained to go to my computer in the upper right hand corner.

311
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
So yeah, even though I was building, you know, new neural neural networks in my brain

312
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
by remembering to go left.

313
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Screw that man.

314
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
I put it all up on the right.

315
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
The task bar is the other main difference.

316
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,500
And I found this wonderful utility called.

317
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
But the heck is it called?

318
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Object doc.

319
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Oh, yes.

320
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Object doc.

321
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
A very commercial name.

322
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,500
However, what it does is it simulates the OS XOS 10 doc at the bottom of your screen.

323
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
And it removes the task bar.

324
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
And you get all of the same functionality that you're used to with the doc on the Mac.

325
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
And that's also something that, you know, I really missed.

326
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
It's trained to go down there to launch my applications.

327
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I don't want to go to a start menu.

328
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I don't want to go to the desktop.

329
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
The desktop is my workplace.

330
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
I don't want filling up with icons to start stuff.

331
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Another thing I'm not too keen about, which happens automatically all too often.

332
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
In fact, even cast blaster does that.

333
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
By the way, using the new version of cast blaster with audio plus,

334
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,500
very interesting concept.

335
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Then the, I guess the downside to Mac versus PC is really the way stuff feels and looks or looks and feels.

336
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
And let me elaborate just a little bit.

337
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,500
The feeling is, I'm talking about the mouse, you know, how the trackpad works and how it scrolls across the screen.

338
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
It just feels a little more.

339
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
I don't know.

340
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
A little more cheap.

341
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I can't explain exactly what that means, but just feels kind of cheap.

342
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
However, it's really fast.

343
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
The same goes for the display.

344
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I have a beautiful LG monitor.

345
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
And, you know, the colors are great and the brightness is there.

346
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,500
But it's, it's still the Mac just has a better display technology.

347
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Of course, things do go just a little bit slower on the Mac.

348
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,500
They render a little bit slower on the screen.

349
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Just displaying stuff.

350
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
I can tell.

351
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
It just takes less time on windows.

352
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Same for scrolling and moving stuff up and down.

353
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:33,500
And I can only presume the reason for that is that Apple sacrificed a little bit of speed for all the beautiful pieces.

354
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Which, of course, in the long run when we have computers that are so powerful that the user experience will always be a continuous snap.

355
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,500
You know, then it'll be nice to have a beautiful, beautiful view, beautiful feel.

356
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Just have everything feel luxurious, but still have the same speed that Windows has today.

357
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I think we're probably still a long way off from that.

358
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Because I've played with a couple of the Mac books, which, of course, Intel based.

359
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,500
And, you know, now you're really competing with the same type of processor.

360
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
And it is just slower.

361
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
And so, if anything, I'm liking the speed of it.

362
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I'm getting used to the kind of cheap feel.

363
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I can't, I hate to say that way.

364
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I can't quite explain it, but it just, yeah, it feels cheap.

365
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
And otherwise, I don't miss too much, honestly.

366
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
So, I think what I'm going to do is continue on Windows.

367
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,500
And I will take the power book back to the Mac store in San Francisco when I'm there.

368
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Which should be Tuesday.

369
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:39,500
And by the way, thank you, IJ, who left a comment at curry.com about the, uh, was about object doc.

370
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Because that is indeed one of the, one of the things that I just really, really missed.

371
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Quick little Trinity update, of course, you should know as a listener to the daily source code.

372
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,500
The Trinity is my Mercedes station wagon diesel 300 turbo diesel, I should say.

373
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Um, which is eggnog colored.

374
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
And, which actually has its own theme song.

375
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,500
It's only one thing we might as well sing along.

376
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:25,500
So, I'll send this link, let me see, uh, who sent it to me here.

377
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Martin Wright.

378
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,500
And it's about challenge X, a three year competition sponsored by General Motors,

379
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
the US Department of Energy and other industry leaders.

380
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,500
17 teams will re-engineer a GM equinox, which is a crossover sport utility vehicle,

381
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:49,500
to minimize energy consumption emissions and greenhouse gases while maintaining or exceeding the vehicles utility performance.

382
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Well, engineering students at the University of California Davis have unveiled their entry.

383
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,500
It's powered by electric motors and a small internal combustion engine that can run on gasoline or ethanol.

384
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
So, they're looking it up to, uh, what they're saying here.

385
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Up to 40 miles running on battery power and then another 40 miles on the internal combustion engine.

386
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,500
And that's all cool, you know, so it's a, it's a very environmentally friendly vehicle,

387
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,500
but they've named it Trinity.

388
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Oh, I'm sorry, but I do have a slight problem with this.

389
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Well, I feel that we have some kind of branded trademark on Trinity and certainly have prior art to show forward.

390
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I, you know, it's, I don't care if they, well, if they call it Trinity, they have to at least say that there is an original,

391
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,500
the OG of the TD, Trinity.

392
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
No, I'm saying, oh, how come that didn't work?

393
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Crap.

394
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I'm supposed to fire automatically.

395
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Yeah, right.

396
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Though G Trinity, right, yeah.

397
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Still episode number 400.

398
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,500
Adam, it's Derek Kay Miller from the Penn Machine podcast.

399
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,500
I haven't left you an audio comment in a while, but I wanted to be there early in the morning for you,

400
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
because it's late at night here in Vancouver, and it's early in England,

401
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,500
and I wanted to say congratulations on the daily source code,

402
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
the Delta CR Charlie, the Charlie, the Carlos,

403
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Wat Throciento's number 400.

404
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
How about that?

405
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,500
I've got a little story for you, actually.

406
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,500
The first podcast I ever heard was DSC number 200 that you did live at Nomdex last year,

407
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
and I wasn't listening on my iPod, and I wasn't listening on my computer.

408
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I was there in the audience, and I was looking up there on the stage and going,

409
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
what the hell is this?

410
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,500
But I came around within a few days.

411
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,500
I was taking the songs that I was recording, and I was posting them on my own podcast,

412
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,500
and then I put them on the pod safe music network.

413
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,500
And over the past year, I've had hundreds and hundreds of podcasts use that music,

414
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
and I've had thousands of people here of them.

415
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
And you know what?

416
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Not long after that, I started getting the editor's association I belonged to,

417
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:32,500
into podcasting, and then earlier this year, my wife started her own podcast over at lip gloss and laptops,

418
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,500
and just recently, I came on board as the new co-host of Inside Home Recording.

419
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
I can't believe it.

420
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Suddenly, I'm Mr. Podcast Guy.

421
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
I'm like the podcast expert.

422
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,500
People have had me come talk about podcasting, and last year I didn't even know what was going on.

423
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,500
So, thanks, because I don't know if it would have happened if I hadn't been sitting there at Nomdex,

424
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
with you doing DSC number 200.

425
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,500
So, here's to 400, and here's to many hundreds more.

426
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Although, of course, it might be the Patricia and the Guy show now.

427
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Anyway, great job, and I hope we'll see you at Nomdex this year.

428
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,500
My wife's coming to it's like a Miller podcast frenzy there.

429
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Talk to you later.

430
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,500
To Patricia came in.

431
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
She sticks her head around the door and just stands there.

432
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
And of course, there's nothing. You can't hear anything.

433
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
And did this.

434
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Yeah, and I said, yeah, it's great.

435
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
And then you just stood there.

436
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I'm like, what are you going to come in?

437
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
So, yeah, can I just sit here and drink my cup of tea?

438
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
I'm like, no, I don't want an audience behind me.

439
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
I just made myself a nice cup of tea.

440
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I see a man standing in his underwear here.

441
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
I'm not in my underwear.

442
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I enjoy my cup of tea and enjoy my husbands's body.

443
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I'm not in my underwear.

444
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
I'm a half half.

445
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
What are we calling?

446
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,500
We call it a weekend baker's outfit.

447
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
What?

448
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
What?

449
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
You called it something, you're...

450
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
I mean, someone had a question about that.

451
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Hold on a second.

452
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Where was it?

453
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Dave Crossfire.

454
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
I couldn't make out the clothing articles in the podcast

455
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
and can't find the text in the show notes.

456
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
You said you wear boxers and what?

457
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
It sounded like wife beaters.

458
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Yeah.

459
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Yeah, wife beaters.

460
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Is that a wife beaters?

461
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Yeah, so if you've ever watched cops...

462
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
It's always a man who wears that.

463
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Every single guy who's beating up his wife wears one of these t-shirts.

464
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
You know, just with the straps.

465
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Yeah.

466
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
That's a wife beater.

467
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Yeah.

468
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
That's what dawn from dawn.

469
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Yeah, they move easier in it.

470
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Yeah, you'll beat your wife more easily.

471
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
She'd take note of that.

472
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Yeah, right.

473
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,500
So...

474
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,500
So I said, if you want to come in, then you have to say,

475
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
you can't just sit here and drink your tea and do nothing.

476
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
I'll charge money for that.

477
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Like some people I know who won't do anything unless they make money for you.

478
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Yeah, right.

479
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Uh-huh.

480
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Exactly.

481
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
So this is show number...

482
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
You know what?

483
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Through all this, I miss the satellite window.

484
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Grape.

485
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Oh, you did?

486
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Yeah.

487
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
And now?

488
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Well, I'll make it 49 minutes.

489
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
You slipped out of that.

490
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Yeah, I flipped out.

491
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Okay.

492
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
This is my 400's show and everyone sent it.

493
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I know.

494
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Congratulations.

495
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Thank you.

496
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Mr. Adam Curry.

497
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Yeah.

498
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
So you're going to continue to come on the shisha?

499
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Now, and then, you know, there are people who want to hear you on your own too.

500
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
No, they're all right.

501
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
It sounds like sounds like everybody just wants you.

502
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
I read it.

503
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Like Lady Patricia and the guy show.

504
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Why?

505
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Right.

506
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Like I've nothing else to do.

507
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Oh, excuse me.

508
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Mommy.

509
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
I know you.

510
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I need to be sure there's...

511
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
That's right.

512
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Give me someone coffee.

513
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
I was right.

514
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Take care of you guys.

515
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
You know.

516
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Okay.

517
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
And I'm going to London tonight.

518
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Yes, you are.

519
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
It's not a great thing overnight.

520
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Meetings all day tomorrow.

521
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Isn't it cool that we're setting up an office here?

522
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Oh, it's so cool because I was thinking

523
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,500
when you are going to the office here in there and now and then.

524
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Yeah.

525
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
And then, yeah.

526
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Have a re-went.

527
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Yes, I'll go with you.

528
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Oh, really?

529
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
Not through the office, but I'll go and have an eye.

530
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Come and clean.

531
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Come and clean my desk.

532
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
I don't have to go by myself in the train.

533
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Okay.

534
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Oh, that's cool.

535
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
And I'll get that's a boring part.

536
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
But then we also want to go if I leave it like,

537
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,940
leave it like 7.30 in the morning or 8 o'clock really?

538
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
Sure.

539
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
Uh-huh.

540
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,340
Well, if it's very cold, I don't know, but I'm up anyway for it.

541
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,940
No, I'm up anyway for Christina, so.

542
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,940
I'm glad you're here because I got a note from Ulrich, Ulrich Pulsin.

543
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
Yeah, Ulrich?

544
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
Ulrich.

545
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,580
And he sent me a link to a BBC series.

546
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Is it Ulrich?

547
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
It probably is, let me say.

548
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,580
No, it's Ulrich.

549
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
With a cake.

550
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Okay.

551
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Ulrich.

552
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,580
Ulrich Pulsin.

553
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,580
Uh-huh.

554
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,420
And it said, did you read about, you must have read this in the paper, the Chris Moiles, who's

555
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,700
the number one morning radio show host here.

556
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,700
He had used the word gay.

557
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:58,500
It was something about, um, see if I, uh, he had said about a ringtone.

558
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,940
Uh, he said, I don't want this one, it's gay.

559
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,700
And so there are a whole bunch of complaints.

560
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,900
And of course, this relates exactly to that whole, you know, common, that back and

561
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,540
forth thing, that back and forth thing that I had with Madge or Richard actually, back

562
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,540
and forth thing.

563
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,540
I believe these sort of remarks.

564
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
It's so yeah.

565
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:19,660
Well, anyway, so the B, then you can analyze everything, just if you say, back and forth

566
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,460
is, uh, that's gay.

567
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,620
So, hey, would you please not record the studio?

568
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
Sorry.

569
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,100
It's already hanging together with Gaffer tape and bailing wire.

570
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,980
Um, so anyway, so the complaints went to the, uh, what they called, the Board of Governors,

571
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,820
who, I guess, like the people who make all the decisions at the BBC because they take

572
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,140
a recomplaint seriously, I presume.

573
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:46,820
And they said, it was not homophobic because the word gay now means rubbish in modern playground

574
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:52,900
speak and need not be offensive to homosexuals, according to the BBC Board of Governors.

575
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,620
And what if they say so then then it's, it's, it's that way, baby.

576
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,620
It's a truth.

577
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,780
So here, so, and then the BBC publishes the history of the word gay.

578
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,060
That's kind of it.

579
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Happy.

580
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:09,660
Belief to be derived from the old French guy, GAI, the Latin guy is, or a Germanic source,

581
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:16,620
originally meant carefree, happy, or bright, and showy, gay, basically.

582
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:23,740
From the late 17th century, it acquired sexual connotation of uninhibited by moral constraints.

583
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,820
That sounds like me.

584
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:32,420
Then Gertrude Stein's, Ms. Fur and Ms. Scheme from 1922, cited as first published reference

585
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:39,540
to ambiguous sexuality, that Noel Coward pens tribute to dandies of the gay 90s, wearing

586
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,420
green carnations in 1929's musical, bitter sweet.

587
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:51,620
Then it was used to describe foppish dress code unattached men or bachelors, until adopted, adopted

588
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,340
by homosexuals themselves in the 1960s.

589
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,780
I didn't know that.

590
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,860
Originally used as an adjective, as in He is gay, the word is adopted as a singular noun.

591
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,620
I am the only gay in the village, it actually says it right there, that's funny.

592
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,380
Then you only gay in the village, you know.

593
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,780
So it went from an adjective, you know, an adjective, as a word that describes it, what

594
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,260
do you call that in Dutch and by fucho-gnau-mort?

595
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
Yeah.

596
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
How old are you?

597
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
How old are you?

598
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
Yeah.

599
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Is that right?

600
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Yeah.

601
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:28,380
To self-standach, noun-bort, a singular noun.

602
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,260
And then children, students, use gay as shorthand for rubbish, don't use bewordleck, bewordleck

603
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,260
have you in bewordleck?

604
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
I don't know.

605
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
That's all conjugation.

606
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,780
I can now come bewordleck, macho-gnau-mort, the benek fucho-gnau-mort, what do you

607
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
do?

608
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
OK.

609
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,060
You're speaking in tongues.

610
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,100
Children and students now use gay as shorthand for rubbish during the 1990s.

611
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,060
And now, at the end of this, it's a BBC by the way.

612
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:56,860
Bloggers substitute gay for boring or dull, reversing the original meaning.

613
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Yeah.

614
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,860
How, I mean, that's how language changes.

615
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Yep.

616
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,860
Isn't that in a language language?

617
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,060
Oh, it changes so much, because you can say something and people will look at you

618
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,420
like that stupid, because you mean something else.

619
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,620
It goes really, really fast, listening to your daughter, you can hear that.

620
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,620
Oh, my God.

621
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,620
Oh, my God.

622
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,620
Oh, my God.

623
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,340
Well, the changes faster than I can print pages for her art homework.

624
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,340
That's for sure.

625
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
No, no.

626
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,820
They're talking about the mallet.

627
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,980
Yeah, the mallet is back, and they like that.

628
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
And it's cool.

629
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,980
It's cool.

630
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
Can you believe that?

631
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Yeah.

632
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,300
And we used to have that painting that, yeah, the made me look like Barry Manillow

633
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
with a mallet.

634
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,260
We can hang it up again, because now it's good.

635
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
Exactly.

636
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,140
I hate that painting.

637
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,740
I love it because you gave it to me.

638
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,860
Oh, it's a sweet.

639
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,220
It was, it makes me look like Barry Manillow with a mallet.

640
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,460
Well, it was a little Chinese guy, New York.

641
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,220
Let's face it.

642
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,860
I am Barry Manillow with a mallet.

643
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,060
I saw him painting and he did it really quickly, really fast.

644
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:00,740
I mean, and I said, can you, I had to sort of cover from a magazine, but the two of us,

645
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,740
yeah, when we left for America.

646
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,180
It was a picture from Hovert de Roast.

647
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,420
Yes, no, no, no, no.

648
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,140
Yes, it was.

649
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,140
Yes, it was.

650
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,980
It was exactly.

651
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,820
It was not from the paparazzi or anything.

652
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:17,740
So I, and he copied that, but in his own way, you look like Barry Manillow

653
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,460
with a mallet.

654
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,020
So somebody who came to a house said, what are you doing with Barry Manillow?

655
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,180
It's crazy.

656
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,220
Stroking his mallet.

657
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,540
It was so funny.

658
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,980
But the mallet is bad.

659
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
The mallet is bad.

660
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980
The mallet is long enough.

661
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,660
I need a mallet song.

662
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,660
Jeff, make me a mallet song.

663
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
We need that.

664
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,660
So funny.

665
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,540
Oh, and the kids, and I know now why she was so grumpy the last couple of weeks.

666
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
So Christina?

667
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
Yeah, yeah.

668
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,740
I noticed a couple of pieces of paper in her waist basket and I could see here

669
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,740
in there.

670
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,220
You read her, of course, fondness that she threw out.

671
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,340
No, no, no, no, she always writes little.

672
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,340
What do you mean, no, no?

673
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
And then she throws it away.

674
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Did you read them?

675
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,820
Sometimes it just lays there.

676
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,260
So I thought, what is this?

677
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,460
And then you could see that she was actually, I am very grumpy the last couple of days

678
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,060
because she was very disappointed in that Jack.

679
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,900
You know, okay, that her parents, that his parents are taking him to Spain.

680
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,100
Yeah, but the way he reacted and suddenly said, well, it's over then because he doesn't

681
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
make any sense.

682
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,100
And, you know, it's not going anywhere so goodbye.

683
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,660
She was going through a self-help therapy.

684
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,660
I think so.

685
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,740
But I read some very wise words, very, but she was a bit disappointed and grumpy

686
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
from it.

687
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,140
So very understandable.

688
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
But you read her shit.

689
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
No, I didn't.

690
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,140
He did.

691
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
She said, just said, I read something.

692
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,780
But somebody has to clean it up.

693
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
But she is wise.

694
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,380
But then you understand it.

695
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,980
And then you see that there's a lot going on.

696
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Yeah.

697
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
I have to, I have to do.

698
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,980
I mean, I felt bad for her when I heard about it, but you know, I don't think

699
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,980
it was a lot of time.

700
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,020
You know, and well, no one really told me the story about how he did it, I didn't get

701
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,020
that information.

702
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,020
That's why I'm glad I read it here and there, yeah, sometimes she writes it down

703
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,660
and throws it away or leaves it on her desk, you know.

704
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,820
But she doesn't, she doesn't, because sometimes she did you read that and I said, well,

705
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,740
yeah, you know, it was just there and she doesn't.

706
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,540
I'll tell you honestly, if she, if I had seen thrown out stuff in her way space, I probably

707
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
wouldn't have read it.

708
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,180
I just don't do that for anybody.

709
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,180
That's not specifically her.

710
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
I just don't do that.

711
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
No, I normally don't.

712
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,180
I mean, I could read all of her email and everything, I guess.

713
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,580
No, but I saw her writing a lot and I thought something's going on there.

714
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,580
She wanted.

715
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,700
I thought she was prepping for her show.

716
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
That too.

717
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,700
Yeah, that too.

718
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,300
Maybe she'll have some, but it's already over.

719
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,300
It's, it's healing, you know, these, it makes the, the, the, the, the, the, the morning,

720
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,180
I was grumpy because of her throwing, and actually the 11 pictures printed out and, of course,

721
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,140
the Mac is the only machine that was configured to the printer and that was broken.

722
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,620
And so I'm trying to print stuff and it's going really slow and download a driver, which

723
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,940
was going to take 20 minutes.

724
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,260
And she does everything, uh, less minutes and, you know, do you remember the last minute,

725
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
man?

726
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,460
Uh, no, refresh my memory.

727
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
That's you.

728
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,460
Sinbad.

729
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
You know, we had a song less minute, man.

730
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,460
Yes.

731
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,460
That's a good one.

732
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,460
Wait.

733
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,460
Ah, ah, ah.

734
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,460
Here we come.

735
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,460
Last minute.

736
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,460
Yeah.

737
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,500
And then there he is.

738
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,380
Who can do it later than anyone can?

739
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
Yeah.

740
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,380
Yeah.

741
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Yeah.

742
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,380
So bad news for you, baby.

743
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,380
Oh, yeah.

744
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,380
Yep.

745
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,380
You know what starts this weekend?

746
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
Oh, football.

747
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,380
World cup soccer.

748
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,980
What would we have to see that one?

749
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,980
What one?

750
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,980
The one from England.

751
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
Is it England, Germany?

752
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,380
Yeah, but baby, hold on second.

753
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
I'd have to see that.

754
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,660
There's going to be games every single day.

755
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,060
Well, I'm saying bad bad news for you is because none of your TV shows will be on.

756
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
It'll all be football.

757
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,060
You don't care?

758
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
No.

759
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,060
Yeah.

760
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
You can watch.

761
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
Really?

762
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
You're not going to go like.

763
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,060
No, no.

764
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,500
I have a lot of magazines to read and playboy.

765
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:15,780
Maybe I can do some research on my computer.

766
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Not?

767
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
Yeah.

768
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
Absolutely.

769
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
We know it.

770
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,940
When you're on your computer, all you have to do to keep up and be able to talk with

771
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
the neighbors is listening to this podcast.

772
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,940
Hi, Adam.

773
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,940
This is Phil.

774
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,140
We're from the Soccer Show podcast available at SoccerShow.com.

775
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,180
And we're going to give a quick preview of the upcoming World Cup.

776
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,300
The World Cup is being staged in Germany.

777
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,900
Kicks off on June the 9th and culminates in the final on July 9th.

778
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:46,180
The hot favorites are going to be Brazil, followed by England, Germany, Argentina, and Italy.

779
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,940
We also have our eye in Holland and France who are just outside that leading pack.

780
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,700
You can get odds of 66 to one against the USA winning, which reflects the difficulty of

781
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,100
their draw as much as the quality of their team.

782
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,260
So Tony, what are you going to be checking out this weekend?

783
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,420
I think Friday you've got to watch the opening game of the tournament.

784
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:07,340
Germany against Costa Rica, 12 new Eastern, on ESPN2, you've got to watch that first game.

785
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,220
It's a real potential banana skin for the host Germany.

786
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,540
They've got a lot of pressure on them and the crowd could turn against them if it doesn't

787
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
go their way.

788
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,580
Okay, Saturday I'm going to be checking out of course, England versus Paraguay, come

789
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,580
on England.

790
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,820
That kicks off 9 a.m. Eastern on ABC.

791
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,780
You've got to keep your eye on England, center forward, Peter Kraut.

792
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,780
He's six foot seven tall, conservatively 60% of which is neck.

793
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,700
If he scores, you'll see him do this crazy body popping robot dance celebration, which you do

794
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
not want to miss.

795
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,740
Well, I think if I've recovered from Peter Kraut's robot celebration, then I'm going to be

796
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:42,820
watching Serbia Montenegro against Holland, 90 A.M. Eastern on ESPN2 on Sunday, Holland might

797
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,220
up for the tournament or a really classy side with some outstanding attacking options.

798
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,940
Serbia Montenegro, SNM as they may be destined to be known or a decent side, but they're

799
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,940
going to have to be depain to make it out of group that also features South American legends

800
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
Argentina.

801
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,380
And that brings us to Monday and the USA versus the Czech Republic, that starts at noon

802
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,100
Eastern on ESPN2.

803
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,660
London, Donovan, and Democracy, easily offer their best chances of hitting the net.

804
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,100
An interesting matchup is going to be the towering Czech Straker Jan Kohler versus the

805
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,900
Man Mountain, a Gucci onaway in the heart of the American defense.

806
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,980
The soccer show is going to be produced in daily shows throughout the tournament.

807
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,220
We're going to discuss all the games that have been played, preview the upcoming games

808
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,100
and cover all the news and gossip as the tournament progresses.

809
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,580
We're going to be playing Listen of Oismail as well, so please feel free to contribute.

811
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,060
So you know, I don't give it a rat's ass about soccer, right?

812
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,860
I'm stupid because I said England Germany, but no, of course not.

813
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,660
You're not stupid.

814
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,860
You just don't know anything about sports.

815
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,700
Now, the Germany is the host.

816
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Yes.

817
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
I thought England was also playing against it.

818
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,540
Well, they could.

819
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:45,740
It could one.

820
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,740
No, I don't think they're in the same pool.

821
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,540
I sure hope so.

822
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
I don't think they're in the same pool.

823
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
They're in the same pool.

824
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
That's what I heard.

825
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,100
So I'm not a big sports fan at all.

826
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,300
I don't give a rat's ass, but I love this.

827
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,820
These guys are going to send me two minute updates so that if you just want to keep up with

828
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,260
what's going on and what I like is anyone in Europe knows where they can see the game.

829
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,740
But this is they tell you when you can see it on in the states, which is kind of cool.

830
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,340
And they're going to give me updates.

831
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,860
You know, I don't need more than two minutes of it.

832
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,340
And just need to know which game I have to watch.

833
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,940
Because you're right, if England plays Germany, yeah, of course I'm watching.

834
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,020
And I'd like to watch how about Holland Brazil.

835
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,100
I think they have to play each other.

836
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,060
I think Brazil is going to kick their ass.

837
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,940
Do you think so?

838
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
Yeah.

839
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,140
But America is, is a long, is people.

840
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,660
America is a long shot favorite of mine.

841
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,380
I think America might actually do something this year.

842
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,660
We'll be kind of cool.

843
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,660
We'll be cool.

844
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,660
And there's more where that came.

845
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
Hi, this is Dave Lyfton of the soccer blockers.

846
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,980
And the best way to follow the action in Germany this summer is by joining us at the

847
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,780
World Cup Roundtable.

848
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,060
Every night America's top soccer bloggers will discuss the matches of the day.

849
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,700
We'll be the upcoming games in a whole lot more.

850
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,020
Come check us out at WorldCupRoundtable.logspot.com.

851
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,860
All right, there's even a pod safe song about it.

852
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,860
Really?

853
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,100
Yeah, and you should learn the words.

854
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,300
If you're rooting for England, it's called Come On England.

855
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,300
Thank you, you remember that.

856
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:32,220
In 66, when all of a way I wish I'd been alive to see that game, ever so big such

857
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:38,220
sense has come all the way.

858
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:49,460
We have the players, we knew what they could do, but they couldn't help us when World Cup

859
00:42:49,460 --> 00:43:19,460

Yeah, come on in one, yeah, yeah

00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,460
Let's start our tune

867
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:21,460
Please bring back your mind

868
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,460
I'm waiting here

869
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,460
You gotta walk up to a horse

870
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,460
And three lines on our chest

871
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:38,460
Cause we all know we are the best

872
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,460
We're gonna get this song played

873
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,460
I'm waiting here someday

874
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:52,460
Come on in one, yeah, you can play

875
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:57,460
Come on in one, yeah, yeah

876
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,460
Let's start our tune

877
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,460
Maybe she can't go on in one, yeah

878
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,460
Come on in one, yeah, yeah

879
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,460
Let's start our tune

880
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,460
Please bring back your mind

881
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,460
Okay, nice song

882
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,460
Sounds a bit a little bit like his head is stuck

883
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,460
In half of the ball or something

884
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,460
In half of what?

885
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,460
In the ball

886
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

887
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,460
I'm tired, I'm tired

888
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,460
I love the lyrics

889
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,460
We'll drink a lot of beer

890
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,460
Yeah, yeah

891
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,460
Go on in England

892
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,460
This is the most important thing

893
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,460
From the bot pods I'm using that word

894
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,460
Listen to their bio, this is great

895
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,460
Started in April of 2004 testosterone

896
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,460
Who's with that call?

897
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,460
Was formed by the two guitarist Ian and Dave

898
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,460
When they wrote their first song Amy

899
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,460
Realizing that they needed more members

900
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,460
Hahaha

901
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,460
Dave and Ian asked their friend Jack to join

902
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,460
And completely line up with Nick on bass

903
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,460
Unfortunately Jack left the band in order to pursue his own career

904
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,460
That's in the bio, I love you guys

905
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,460
That is so funny

906
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,460
That's marketing

907
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,460
That's wonderful

908
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,460
That's good

909
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,460
The influences Blink 182

910
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
Nerf Herder

911
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,460
Bowling for soup

912
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,460
And Green Day

913
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,460
How old are we, babe?

914
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,460
I'm fucking older we now

915
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,460
Yeah, right

916
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,460
I just got some nerdy stuff to do

917
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,460
So you're welcome to hang around

918
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
But

919
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,460
No, I'm actually waiting for you

920
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,460
So I can do your hair

921
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,460
And then I can get the hell out

922
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,460
Yeah, I have to do some stuff

923
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,460
Alright, let me finish up

924
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,460
I've got a couple of nerdy stuff to talk about

925
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,460
My computer and stuff

926
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,460
Okay

927
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,460
Okay

928
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,460
Will anybody enjoy that?

929
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,460
Well

930
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,460
Yeah

931
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,460
Yeah

932
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,460
That sounds good

933
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,460
Oh good

934
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,460
But the good thing about is if they don't

935
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,460
They can just fast forward

936
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,460
That's right

937
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,460
To the song at the end

938
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,460
Or they can fast forward through that

939
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,460
And that's the way to get rid of it

940
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,460
Out of your system

941
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,460
It's out of my system

942
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,460
Right

943
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,460
Out of my system

944
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,460
Have you been injured

945
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,460
Listening to average podcast

946
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,460
Have you been the victim of pod faders?

947
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Have you been fraudulently induced to listen to a podcast

948
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,460
That has some standard pod safe music

949
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,460
And a really lame host

950
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,460
That I urge you to subscribe to the Jersey Todd Show

Just listen to one of our satisfied listeners

962
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,460
I used to subscribe to them pod cast

963
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,460
With that their iPod

964
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,460
After five minutes my ears hurt

965
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,460
Oh

966
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,460
Then I got smaller earbuds

967
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,460
Now my ears don't hurt so bad

968
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,460
And oh yeah

969
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,460
I listened to that Jersey Todd Show

970
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,460
That's some fine listening

971
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Well listen to our celebrity endorser Matthew Ebel

972
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,460
Hey this is Matthew Ebel

973
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,460
And I've been listening to

974
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,460
Jersey Todd Show

975
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,460
From Jersey

976
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,460
And it's okay

977
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,460
So if you're in an accident or injure yourself at work

978
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,460
And you're injured really badly

979
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,460
And there's one bone everywhere

980
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,460
You should call an ambulance

981
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,460
Chances are the ambulance driver

982
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,460
Is listening to the Jersey Todd Show

983
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,460
www.JurzyTonShow.com

984
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,460
Oh man

985
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,460
A lawyer with a sense of humor

986
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,460
I love it

987
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,460
The ad challenge is still on

988
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,460
It'll be on for quite a while

989
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,460
It's going to be fun

990
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,460
Pretty soon I'm going to start playing some of the stuff that's coming in

991
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,460
So basically you come up with the way to sell earthlink

992
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,460
Help us sell it

993
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,460
And you'll make some money if you win

994
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,460
You know for those guys from Jersey

995
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,460
They set up the promotion

996
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,460
Ad challenge.podshow.com

997
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,460
It's a really long show

998
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,460
In fact for those of you listening to this on serious stars

999
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,460
102

1000
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,460
It's time for me to cut out

1001
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,460
Let's see

1002
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,460
I think we'll have Pacific Coast Hellway next

1003
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,460
And then you regular Tuesday line up

1004
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,460
We'll follow

00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,460
And of course I'll be back tomorrow

1006
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,460
For you

1007
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,460
Well, it's going to be just another show

1008
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,460
And for us here doing the podcast

1009
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,460
It'll be 401

1010
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,460
401

1011
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,460
Man

1012
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,460
All right serious listeners

1013
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,460
Take care of seeing tomorrow

1014
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,460
PCH next

1015
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,460
Bye

1016
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,460
Two split shows

1017
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,460
What it is

1018
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,460
It wasn't planning on having Patricia coming

1019
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,460
But she always makes me laugh

1020
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,460
Big time

1021
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,460
Okay

1022
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,460
I promised some geeky stuff

1023
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,460
And it's about my

1024
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,460
About my Macintosh

1025
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,460
Because you know this thing had a really strange

1026
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,460
Fryout

1027
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,460
I've had screens go and

1028
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,460
Distrives go and

1029
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,460
All kinds of other stuff

1030
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,460
And by the way this 1.67

1031
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,460
Geagerhertz power book G4

1032
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,460
I've heard other similar issues

1033
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,460
Besides the audio issue

1034
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,460
Which was one big problem

1035
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,460
Which we got fixed

1036
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,460
And the fan became really noisy

1037
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,460
And I heard that happened with other people's

1038
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,460
Power books as well

1039
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,460
And I didn't just hear it from here

1040
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,460
Say actually heard their fans start to crank

1041
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,460
And then you tap the speaker

1042
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,460
I mean it's just it's all hardware stuff

1043
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,460
It's just poor manufacturing

1044
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,460
I guess we're designed that

1045
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,460
It's still being tested

1046
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,460
So people are sending in their comments

1047
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,460
And feedback

1048
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,460
Hey Adam this is VT

1049
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,460
From the gaming's edge podcast

1050
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,460
Wanting to make a quick audio

1051
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,460
Comment about your recent Mac was

1052
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,460
Specifically the fact that you

1053
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,460
noticed that the second life client

1054
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,460
Actually runs faster on many PCs

1055
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,460
Then it does on many Macs

1056
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,460
This of course is a direct result of the fact

1057
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,460
That when Lyndon research first

1058
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,460
Created second life

1059
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:36,460
It was developed initially for windows

1060
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,460
Yeah probably for whether direct ex

1061
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,460
System calls or something like that

1062
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,460
Yeah the Mac will get

1063
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,460
This is really where the problem started

1064
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,460
With the Mac I have to say

1065
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,460
When it started running second life

1066
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,460
It could really really hot and the fan

1067
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,460
Will be blowing full speed

1068
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,460
And then that would make my palm sweaty

1069
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,460
And all kinds of sweaty gunk would feed

1070
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,460
Feed into the keyboards

1071
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,460
And as I said keys would just pop

1072
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,460
And off because I was tapping

1073
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
I'm so hard

1074
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,460
Of course you second life

1075
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,460
Basically the Mac version

1076
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,460
Is just a port of the windows

1077
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,460
Codebase

1078
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,460
Now they did go in and do some enhancement

1079
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,460
Specifically for the Mac port

1080
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,460
One of which being adding

1081
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Some OpenGL specific calls

1082
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,460
To increase graphics performance

1083
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,460
On Macs that have higher end graphics cards

1084
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,460
And also added some auto-vec instructions

1085
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,460
That being the special effects

1086
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,460
On the G4 and G5 CPUs

1087
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,460
That are in many Macs

1088
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,460
To increase the background performance

1089
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,460
But those little tweaks and refinements

1090
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,460
In the grand scheme of things

1091
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,460
Don't really quite overcome the fact

1092
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,460
That the version that you play

1093
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,460
Second life when you're playing on a Mac

1094
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,460
Wasn't really cut it specifically for the Mac

1095
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,460
Another key thing to consider

1096
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,460
When comparing the games performance

1097
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,460
On the different operating systems

1098
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,460
Is the fact that unlike Windows XP

1099
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,460
OS 10 actually uses protected memory

1100
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,460
Which essentially trades off

1101
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,460
A small fraction of your overall system

1102
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,460
Performance in favor of a much greater level of system

1103
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,460
Is this turning you on as much as it's turning me on?

1104
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,460
Probability

1105
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,460
So when you factor in the fact that the game was a port

1106
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,460
And that it's running on a system that is consciously

1107
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,460
Sacrificing speed for stability

1108
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,460
Yes, there you have your performance

1109
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,460
That's it

1110
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,460
That's the hardware configuration

1111
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,460
In both cases is at least comparable

1112
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,460
CPU graphics card memory

1113
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,460
You get the idea

1114
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,460
So aesthetics and user interface aside

1115
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,460
There are actually some very significant differences

1116
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,460
In Windows 10 and Windows XP

1117
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,460
Protected memory just being one of the most important ones

1118
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,460
Having said that

1119
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,460
I do feel your pain

1120
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,460
Regarding all your hardware failures

1121
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,460
But suffice to say

1122
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,460
I think your laptops tend to get a little more travel

1123
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,460
And abuse than the average persons do

1124
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,460
I could go on

1125
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,460
But this is getting kind of long

1126
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,460
So I'll leave you with this thought

1127
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,460
Okay

1128
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,460
What happens when gaming nerds cut a record?

1129
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,460
Granny got game

1130
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,460
Hot safe music network

1131
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,460
I did

1132
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,460
Check it

1133
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,460
Check it

1134
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,460
Okay, thank you

1135
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,460
Nerdtalk

1136
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,460
Oh

1137
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,460
Nerdtalk

1138
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,460
Yep

1139
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,460
So I was right

1140
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,460
I was writing my assumptions about sacrificing some of that

1141
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:29,460
Nice smooth stuff and stability stuff

1142
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,460
Which should be actually Windows stuff is stable

1143
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,460
It's not another stuff is crashing on me

1144
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,460
Sometimes a little hard to switch between applications

1145
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,460
That are graphic intensive though it takes a long time

1146
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,460
Which sucks because you know that way

1147
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,460
It's very hard to do a quick hide on second life

1148
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,460
When your real life girlfriend comes in

1149
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,460
Hey, I'm a start from the just start from podcast

1150
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,460
That just start from that order

1151
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,460
I was listening to DSC 399

1152
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,460
And you were talking about your fried power book

1153
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,460
And how the keyboard and mouse wasn't working

1154
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,460
But did you cut up on the external keyboard?

1155
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,460
If you did that you could probably boot off the install desk

1156
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,460
And that should give you the driver's career too

1157
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,460
If not, you could just get one of those new MacBooks

1158
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,460
But that wouldn't solve the burning enough stuff

1159
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,460
When you've all three problems

1160
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,460
I was surprised they hear you complaining about the Apple hardware

1161
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,460
I switched it over two years ago

1162
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,460
And I have an old power map G4

1163
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,460
I use it for everything including my podcast

1164
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,460
And a lot of video editing

1165
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,460
And I've never had a hardware problem

1166
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,460
So I hope it helps

1167
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,460
I look forward to show 400

1168
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,460
You can find my podcast that just sounds not worth

1169
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,460
Bye

1170
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,460
All right Josh, thanks buddy

1171
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,460
Yeah, yeah

1172
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,460
I just refused to accept that I've gotten all Monday morning models

1173
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,460
You know, it's just

1174
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,460
But I've been through this with you

1175
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,460
I've been a

1176
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,460
I've been a Mac beta tester

1177
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,460
Up until the Mac actually became just as useful as Windows

1178
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,460
And now I'm noticing some of these hardware things that are just pissing me off

1179
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,460
You know, it's really making me angry

1180
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,460
And I must say there's a lot of software out there

1181
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,460
Running on Windows

1182
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,460
There's a lot of software from Mac too, but

1183
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,460
I don't know

1184
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,460
It's still kind of up in the air

1185
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,460
All right, the wind it up

1186
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,460
Pods have music artists

1187
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,460
Where people on behalf of Pods have music artists

1188
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,460
Ask me all the time

1189
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,460
How do we get a song played on your show

1190
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,460
I said, I don't know

1191
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,460
You send me an email or something

1192
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,460
Get my attention and then

1193
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,460
I'll listen to it if I like it

1194
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,460
I put it on

1195
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,460
It's that simple

1196
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,460
And of course everything being played on the

1197
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,460
Daily Source Code from the Pods have music network

1198
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,460
If the artist is into it

1199
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,460
It goes live for purchase after being played

1200
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,460
As a part of our Pods show plus

1201
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,460
Rollout

1202
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,460
A rolling rollout

1203
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,460
And one way to get my attention is to call into the voice mail lines

1204
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,460
Hey Adam, what's up?

1205
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,460
This is Gary Alexander calling you from Los Vegas

1206
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,460
I'm originally from South Carolina

1207
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,460
I'm a singer songwriter

1208
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,460
And I am a Pods show

1209
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,460
Pods say from music artists

1210
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,460
And I really like for you to check out my music

1211
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,460
I have about four songs uploaded right now

1212
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,460
And I think you may dig the song listen

1213
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,460
Which is basically a songwriters' plea

1214
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,460
And the song was upon the time of America

1215
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,460
I think that you may dig some of that stuff

1216
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,460
And I think that you'll get it

1217
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,460
I've been performing since I was 14 years old

1218
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,460
I'm now 30 years old

1219
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,460
And it took kick in and I had a record deal

1220
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,460
We won a brother's interview in details

1221
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,460
And I'm more excited about Pods show

1222
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,460
Than I have been about any of the other shit

1223
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,460
That I've been involved with

1224
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,460
I know it sounds like I'm just kissing ass

1225
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,460
But you know I don't get fast no fans

1226
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,460
I dig what you're doing

1227
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,460
And I hope that you dig what I'm doing

She's a small tail girl, with big time dreams

1269
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:32,460
And I'm just a Romeo, with some fainted blue jeans

1270
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:42,460
Yes girls like this, and made me want a role on my dreams

1271
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:48,460
Once upon a time, a miracle

1272
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:58,460
Oh yeah, once upon a time, a miracle

1273
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:12,460
She can eat us, when they go 20 years

1274
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:18,460
I don't know, I hear that song, and I roll down the window

1275
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:27,460
I think back to those days, oh I remember

1276
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:35,460
You're supposed to have a miracle

1277
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:43,460
You're supposed to have a miracle

1278
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:49,460

Oh yeah, once upon a time, a miracle

1281
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:13,460
She can't eat us, when they go 20 years

1282
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:17,460
She's got a bit of a spring scene vibe too

1283
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:23,460
Gary Alexander from Nevada

1284
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:29,460
Originally from a small town of America, Joanna South Carolina

1285
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:37,460
Once upon a time in America, and just got an email from the satellite repairman, Peter, although I was late and he was late

1286
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,460
And it's too late to tell the serious satellite listeners about this

1287
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:47,460
But special guest today on this interesting day to day zero six zero six zero six

1288

We'll be none other than Satan, check it out at pacificcoasthellway.com

I'll be back, oh no, maybe not tomorrow because I'm going to the city

1290
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:07,460
So you may have to miss a show, but then certainly we'll have one on Thursday to catch up and Friday

1291
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,460
And get into the world cup and do all kinds of fun stuff, I guess
