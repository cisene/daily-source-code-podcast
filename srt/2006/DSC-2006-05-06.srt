9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I like to think I'm trying to keep you ready.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're fantastic.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You built a CRT.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
BBC.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sure they're bummed out about all this noise about the Minister of Parliament

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and they're trying to now really push the pedal to the metal.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They get their money from public funds.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, I mean, from public funds, the public literally pays for a television and radio license.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a hundred and twenty-one pounds a year.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Ten pounds a month and you can watch and enjoy all the BBC programs.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you don't buy the way and even if you buy a television set, they'll track you down.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And the fine can be up to a thousand pounds.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But it's good.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I enjoy what the BBC delivers.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And now they want to raise the amount of money they want, above standard inflation rate.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So they're asking for, I think, 2.3 percent more.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not too sure on the figures, but it's a hell of a lot of hundred millions more.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Which means that we, the inhabitants would have to pay more.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And so now they're going through this whole review process.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And they're trying to prove that it's going to be worth it.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
One of the things is very interesting.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They said it's that they're dealing with extraordinary inflation, which boils down to the fact,

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
they say that because of the media landscape today, it's very hard to get good qualified people.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So they need more money to attract these, these high flyers who are already been snapped up by

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
other broadcast corporations and other production companies.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I was like, please, would you open up your ears for a second and listen to the talent that's all around you?

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, no.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
They've put that in a separate little box and they're saying, we're going to make the BBC.com website,

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
or BBC.co.uk website.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're going to make it the place for user generp when a minute.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
For user generated content content content content content.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So they're trying to be hipsters.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And they're also saying it's going to be, this is interesting that they want to be the place

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
for independent music.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's, we'll see what they do with that.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I still find that there's a huge disconnect within the BBC between BBC digital who responsible for all that stuff.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And the program makers, the people who are making radio and television programming,

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
they really don't cooperate together from my personal observations.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So it was just, you know, so they're trying to make it show that they're worth all this extra money.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And I think they're going to be, it's going to be declined, I think.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And justly so.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, and so now they're also publishing the salaries of the top TV hosts and then radio presenters.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And it's just, it's, and the newspapers are really going at this.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You know, you have Rupert Murdoch who owns Sky, who has used really a competition for the BBC in the marketplace,

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
even though it's competition for eyeballs, not for advertising money,

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
because the BBC doesn't have any advertisers.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And so the sun newspaper, which he owns, of course, is slamming the BBC off the time.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So it's just fun to watch.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Over the weekend, I did show Patricia a second life.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And I was a little wary to be quite honest because, you know, she's a smart.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
She's like, um, online game.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, okay. What's it about fucking?

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I said, well, there's that.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And she said, well, just don't let anyone see you.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is why I love my wife. She's so incredibly smart and with it.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But she was actually fascinated. And she's been asking a lot of questions.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And she has some pretty good insights that we've been talking about business opportunities for second life.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I think we can really be productive.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There's a lot of things.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In fact, I wouldn't mind sitting in my office and having representations of other podshow people at HQ,

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
sitting in my office, sitting in the office or in the same proximity.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And we can, you know, pass stuff to each other, which would be notes or, you know,

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the way we do in real life.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Only, I think that this is a much richer interface.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And you really do get sucked in, whereas if I'm on Skype or on IM or, you know,

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
or emailing with people, then, you know, it's still seem somewhat removed.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And the reverse is also kind of true that, and I've said this before,

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
second life is doing something to me in real life.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In fact, I actually went out shopping with Patricia on Sunday and had a good time.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And as she's walking along, I'm looking at her saying to myself,

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
how she would really look good and, you know, dress like this sort of.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And it's because I've been looking at all these avatars and having these exact same thoughts.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And it's really giving me some kind of extra appreciation for, um, for real life.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's hard, it's hard to explain it.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It really, really is.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But emotion and communication melted into one with the visual aspect.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It does something to you.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Again, I am the guy who gladly point you towards the drugs that won't kill you.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In five years, we will be using this type of architecture, I believe,

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
for a lot of our day-to-day communication.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And what's happening is there's this just fantastic world where you have everything that you can

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
imagine, you can make, you can dream up, but there's infrastructure of money flow

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and land and ownership and rights and stuff like that.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I see so much opportunity.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I don't necessarily see it as, oh, let's go all sitting a circle and listen to a podcast.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But once again, what happened last night, where I think we had at one point almost 50 different avatars, people,

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
on the rooftop of Curry Castle.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Partying, um, I really got to figure out how to, how to play Podsake music.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I got this box of free tunes and what's cool about it is,

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
when I start playing it, everybody in proximity hears it.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And if you walk away from it, it actually gets softer and it's a stereo vibe.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So if you are to the right of me, you'll hear it in your left ear and vice versa on the left side.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's, it's outrageously cool.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You know, you can dance, you can chat, but then all of a sudden, all of a sudden, ladies and gentlemen,

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
who should crash the party?

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But Madge Weinstein beautifully, beautifully animated as the bloated lesbian.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And, you know, so that was very funny, of course.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But what, what I really, really liked is, um,

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Kachia was there. You know, Kachia, she just done all this great video work for us.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And does my headers on Curry.com. She gives such great head there.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And Madge says, hey, is that Kachia, the video chick from Holland?

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They paired off and they went off into a separate corner and had a conversation.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean, that doesn't happen on just regular instant message systems.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This was something extraordinarily cool.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In fact, I know that at least five people who were at the party got laid last night in second life.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And yes, that's an uneven number, but hey, it is second life.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now, just as in first life, real life, you have to respect other people in second life.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And no, none of my neighbors, and all of a sudden, I have sprouted quite a few,

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
including my good friend comic strip blogger with his lighthouse to the right,

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
who has not once dropped by the castle because, as he says in the comments on Curry.com,

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
he, uh, he didn't receive an invite.

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I did make sure to invite him, because I think that people would really get a kick out of meeting him at a party.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But I have neighbors, people.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So could you please do me favor and not be flying through other people's castles and houses and messing about with their stuff and sitting in their chairs and stuff?

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Otherwise, everyone has to lock their shit up and it's just not, it's not cool.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So a little bit of respect for the neighbors if you don't mind because they actually did come and complain.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
They were cool about it, but, you know, it is a neighborhood and it is kind of looking pretty gaudy.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So if you wouldn't mind taking your crap with you, you know, your cages, your sex machines,

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
there were some awesome stuff there this morning.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I left the, the rotating pod show, um, headphone head ball about the castle.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So it's a little more of a beacon and you should be able to find it.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
A curry castle just to go to the search command in a second life.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Since, yeah, totally messes with your head.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Totally sets you up differently than you'd expect.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not really a game.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It is interaction with other people.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It is very much like real life.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now I've been on, you know, for a lot like 12, 13 days now.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Some people observations and some things that I really, um, that really I don't like about the system.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you, uh, form a friendship with someone, which if essentially is like becoming, you know,

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you're both on each other's body list, you can at that point be tracked by your friend.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And you can teleport to your friend no matter where they are in second life.

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Now that really takes a whole lot of respect because I have business meetings.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm, I'm right now doing some interesting business stuff development in second life.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Uh, we're not buying an island, but you better believe we're buying something.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You better believe we need much bigger infrastructure for what I expect we can actually do with this.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I mean, cheese. Think about, you know, the pod save music artist performing live and then being able to meet and greet them later.

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You'll find the experiences almost as good as the real thing almost as good.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Certainly a heck of a lot more convenient.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So, you know, I've, I've been in meetings, I've been other places when all of a sudden someone who's on my friends list drops right in, you know, and it's rude.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And you really have to treat that with respect. So what I've done is I've cleaned up my friends list.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Everyone who added me as a friend, I've pretty much removed every single one of you.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Not because I don't want to be your buddy and hang out, but before I give away friendship, um,

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have to know that I can get that respect because it's, uh, the interruptions are not fun.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I, what I don't think is anywhere or something, you know, I like to be in second life.

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'd like to be able to listen to podcasts in there, do my email in there, watch some video podcasts, maybe invite someone in if I see something cool.

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's a great way to share media, by the way, particularly that song stuff, man.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just I click on the CD that I have on my hand and everyone can hear it, you know, that's a very, very cool way to share audio.

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And the same can be done with video because people have demonstrated that to me.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But I'd like to have like a cone of silence, you know, so I can just pull something down where no one can see me, no one can hear me, whatever I'm doing.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And this is not about sex, by the way.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But of course, that would be an integrated part of the experience.

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But, you know, because I can't have sex now, you know, anyone can, can just teleport down on me and take a picture, you know, I'd be the laughing stock.

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I could just be spin Martin posting that everywhere. No, no, no, no, we're not going to, I'm completely,

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
celibate.

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Second life, celibate, SLC, Sierra Lima, Charlie.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Because of that.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You know, so it would be cool if there was some way of pulling down a cone of silence.

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So if you're not on my friends list, you obviously can't track me.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then the I am's cranky, oh, man.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Just, and I don't, there's no way to shut them off.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You either shut off every all communications or you shut nothing off, and that's a real bummer.

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So, you know, I just have I am's coming in all the time.

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's okay. I'm learning to ignore them or respond when it's appropriate.

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But, you know, if I don't respond, it's because I'm probably doing something else.

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I am very, very excited to tell you that what we're doing, and it'll be under the pod show banner.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's going to fit perfectly with what we're doing.

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I hope we get lots more listeners coming in.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Podcasters, of course, very welcome, because you guys are enthusiastic and you bring such an incredible network of people and,

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and music and entertainment and fun.

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I want to be able to encapsulate that, as it were, into something that anybody can really enjoy and experience.

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And also, we'll help you learn.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay?

185
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So I'll keep you up the speed. I say within about 30 days, we should have something up and running.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm just not going to tell you where or what or how, but very, very excellent and exciting opportunity.

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do you take it in the air?

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah.

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Lady Patricia, let's drop by.

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hello.

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is not just because we love each other very much and we like doing stuff together.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But it's all about ratings.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, isn't it so sharp?

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't like that.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What?

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, that's not honest.

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Of course.

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What do you mean?

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's the most honest thing I can say.

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
People love it when you're on the show.

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay.

202
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But I just do it because sometimes I like to talk to you.

203
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Is it okay?

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, it's okay.

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can hear you.

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah, Patricia was complaining about the sound in the studio.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's right.

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I gave, I lent Christina my headphones.

209
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Uh-huh.

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yep.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So that's how they got busted.

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah.

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I like it.

214
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So anyway, due to popular demand, I'm trying to get Patricia.

215
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm trying to wear it on.

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is not, it is nice.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Adam is in his underwear.

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, I'm not in my underwear.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Adam is on the way.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Not in my underwear.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, yeah.

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have my black, uh, for say, slacks on.

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Are these my first six?

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yep.

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And my rustling, brumly, crumly shoes.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yep.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And this is, this is, this you gave me.

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is my Italian wife beater.

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, is it?

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
My other ones are really wife beater.

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This is a little more stylish.

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I said, are you going to beg the bread?

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm making a pasta for you, baby.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Come here.

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll make your pasta rise.

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So we're doing something fun tonight.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think it's seven o'clock.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hopefully it's fun.

244
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We don't know that.

245
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Uh, we were watching Joan Collins on Jonathan Ross.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Two, three weeks ago.

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah.

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And you like Joan Collins?

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're, uh, like her.

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
She's, she's a feisty lady.

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah.

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And how old is she now?

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
She's got to be pushed in seven days.

254
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Wow.

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
She's got to be very close.

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
She's already seven.

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Really?

258
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
She looks amazing.

259
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And, you know, you can say anything about her.

260
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She's well preserved.

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Now she's well preserved.

262
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
She looks good.

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And she's.

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But that's gone.

265
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think even on there's something very sexy about her.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I really, really, really just, I'm curious.

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What the rest of her looks like?

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why?

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Because I just want to know.

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I mean, would it be like a, would her head stick out like a sore thumb?

272
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
About the rest?

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I think no, no, no.

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I think she takes care of herself.

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
For skin is not bad.

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She knows.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
She's still with that guy.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Didn't she have some younger guy?

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, she has a younger guy.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Those guys will keep you moving.

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah.

283
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
She said that she's very happy with him.

284
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
She tried a couple of times.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I mean, with her.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
She's been interested.

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
She's been married.

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Some interesting guys.

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But didn't work out.

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Who was she?

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
She's a strong woman.

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Who was she married to?

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't know.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, come on.

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There was some famous guy.

297
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
She was married to.

298
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It wasn't her?

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No.

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
No.

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I thought so.

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And some whack-out guy that didn't work out at all.

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Peter or something.

304
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

305
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

306
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He turned out to be some kind of, of course.

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Of course.

308
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So she's doing a tour.

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
A small theater to a.

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

311
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
An evening with Joan.

312
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I can't.

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And so we're lying on that.

315
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And now we're looking at each other.

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We're saying, what is she going to do?

317
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

318
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And I grab a blackberry.

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm like, yeah.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let's order some tickets.

321
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah.

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So we were very curious.

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What an evening with Joan Collins.

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah.

325
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's about 35 miles away.

326
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's not in London.

327
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
She's not in London at all.

328
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a nice, nice trip.

329
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I hope so.

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah.

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So it's to the south of here.

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So it's about.

334
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why are you doing that?

335
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Why?

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Well, we don't have to go.

337
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If you don't want to go, we don't have to go.

338
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, why not?

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But because.

340
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You know how to do a lesson.

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I thought it'd be interesting.

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
How my future will be.

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, please.

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I mean, this is your future.

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Right here on this show.

348
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This is your future.

349
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is your future.

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
When Jonathan asked her.

351
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You know, why she did this.

352
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
She said, why?

353
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I need the money.

354
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's what I always say.

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean, work.

356
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I need the money.

357
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's what I always say.

358
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
People think that.

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't always use more money.

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
People always equate celebrity status to wealth.

361
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't have to do anything anymore.

362
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah.

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's so not true.

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Look it up.

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

366
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't have to do anything.

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You want to live like a star.

368
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If you want.

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Once you are a star like she is.

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
People expect her to live in a beautiful house.

371
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
She cannot just live in a little college.

372
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's like we do.

373
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Of course she could.

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Of course she could.

375
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You know, people expected to live in a mansion.

376
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And she lives.

377
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
She has a beautiful man.

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I've got to tell you.

379
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am so beyond that.

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
For myself.

381
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh yeah.

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then why are you building castles in second life?

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, to accommodate.

384
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Why a castle.

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, why just because I like what a castle looks like.

386
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why not a bunker.

387
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
For exactly the way you just said a bunker.

388
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And besides, curry bunker does not have the same caché as curry castle.

389
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So what I mean is everybody would like to have their own castle.

390
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let me just say, well, we've had a castle.

391
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I miss it.

392
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Still very much.

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's part of it.

395
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because the castle I'm building in second life is a great place for entertaining.

396
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh.

397
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Okay.

398
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Uh huh.

399
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah.

400
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay.

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You want to get into second life now.

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You want to talk about that?

403
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, you know.

404
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I see that it's.

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Very, very interesting.

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And it's brilliant.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And I see it as a game.

408
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But I don't see that.

409
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You don't see the purpose of it?

410
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No.

411
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I mean, people can hardly deal with the first life.

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And now they're escaped to.

413
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They want to escape to a second life.

414
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Well, let.

415
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Let.

416
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then and then probably somebody that they're not.

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And then probably be a girl a chick with big boobs and a very extremely high heels.

418
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Have you seen me in second life?

419
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Are you the girl with a boobs?

420
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No.

421
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No.

422
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So everybody's of course somebody that they actually are not.

423
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Well, you, you can.

424
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Is that the, the fantasy?

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, did you, well, first of all, let's just step back.

426
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
See, I am the girl with the big boobs and the extremely high heels.

427
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes, exactly.

428
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And, and all the girls in all the girls in second life who look anything like you.

429
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I immediately have a crush on.

430
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The only thing is they're about six feet tall.

431
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Uh huh.

432
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's the only difference.

433
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And if you were in second life.

434
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

435
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But if you were in second life.

436
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The, the only thing you change about yourself is you make yourself taller.

437
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Right.

438
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
True or not.

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah.

440
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Okay.

441
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Now, let me just step back for a sec because I said this to you last night.

442
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You said, who has, in fact, you, you did want a real Patricia.

443
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Who was time for this?

444
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're really.

445
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And I said, this is.

446
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
People have hard time for each other.

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, boy.

448
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No.

449
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah.

450
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Before you get into that, let me just step back.

451
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's replacing television time.

452
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's replacing all that other time that is spent on other entertainment.

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't think that it's in addition.

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You know, so we spend.

455
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Time to find the TV.

456
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If we watch television together, you know, that we always,

457
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
uh, you know, or argue about it.

458
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Or usually about.

459
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Can't you make comments during the commercials?

460
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Have you, you know, or, you know, a discussion.

461
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Or you talk about it.

462
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Or you enjoy it together.

463
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And you know, with me, you do something together.

464
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Together.

465
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Right.

466
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But that's what second life.

467
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
To get lots of people do second life together.

468
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Couso and Joe.

469
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So I need to sit there with my laptop and play with you together in second time.

470
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, you don't have to.

471
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Well, first of all, I'm allowed to have some personal time to do whatever the hell I want to do.

472
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Right.

473
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And you know, like you don't do that.

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, I take advantage of that privilege.

475
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And this actually is, if anything, this is cutting into my flying time.

476
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I might have, I might have decided to fly instead of, uh,

477
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
sit on second life for two hours.

478
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So, but it's a, it's a choice.

479
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And that's what I think is so interesting.

480
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Why are people choosing this?

481
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't give me that, that's smart.

482
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You think I'm talking out of it?

483
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm not.

484
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm serious about it.

485
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm serious about it.

486
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm serious.

487
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm serious.

488
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay, dear.

489
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Um, so, uh, Mark Yosimoto Nemkov.

490
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hold on, you know, from Pacific Coast, Hellway.

491
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So we interviewed Blake Morgan, who, uh, is the owner of the record company.

492
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And also of a couple other, uh, pod save artists that we've played.

493
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Listen to what he says.

494
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Undeniably, every single time, um, any of our music has been played on, on your show or on Adam's show.

495
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm, and Adam playing, uh, ever since, um, from Leslie's record.

496
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We, we saw a gigantic hit instantly.

497
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like we saw a huge spike instantly.

498
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And it's not like a coincidence or anything.

499
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's, it's absolutely clear.

500
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You can see it on iTunes.

501
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We know it happening off of our site.

502
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There's no doubt about it.

503
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Podcasting works.

504
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's the new radio.

505
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

506
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, I wouldn't go so far.

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Say it's the new radio.

508
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But for those guys.

509
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I always say it for the music.

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, but for the, you know, people from traditional music business.

511
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, it is, it is the new radio.

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's the new promotional vehicle.

513
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And they're selling on iTunes.

514
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So wait until we finally get everything open up.

515
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And the MP3's will be available on the podcast music network.

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I think we can actually break some of the shit that's going on.

517
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's going to be phenomenal.

518
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah.

519
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The following is an actual pod star conversation.

520
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
May 1st 2006.

521
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Pod star emergency.

522
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
This is Adam.

523
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah.

524
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm stuck in a stop wait.

525
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And the guy we're coming next to me is listening to corporate radio.

526
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So loud.

527
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I can't hear my favorite podcast.

528
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay, sir.

529
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Try not to panic.

530
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I've just called in an air strike from the pod father.

531
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That things happen to people who listen to bad radio.

532
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Is everything all right now, sir?

533
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yes.

534
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yes.

535
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Thank you.

536
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, bless you.

537
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Odd star.

538
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Tell us where bad radio lives.

539
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And we'll make sure it's gone.

540
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So the pod show palace coming along quite nicely.

541
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Quite nicely.

542
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
In fact, I'm looking for

543
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Scriptures and animators.

544
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Who, so this is real life stuff.

545
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Okay.

546
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm looking for Scriptures and animators who can help out with this project that I'm working on,

547
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
which I think will fit seamlessly into what we're doing in real life and podcast.

548
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And we'll just give us an extra dimension.

549
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You know, not trying to hook you on crack or anything, but it could happen.

550
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So if you're, you know, think, what is it?

551
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Machinima?

552
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Is that what they call it?

553
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You know, where you create videos from second life.

554
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Think that.

555
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Think about, you know, great animation.

556
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Think about, you know, the Scriptures who, and I've looked at the scripting language for second life.

557
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It seems.

558
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It doesn't actually seem all that rich.

559
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You know, there's some, there's some good stuff in there.

560
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But could do with a lot more.

561
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But if you're interested, fire off an email to pod show palace at gmail.com.

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So, Scriptures and animators experience in second life, please only,

563
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and send them off to podshowpalis at gmail.com.

564
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Again, neighbor.

565
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Open up your parcel to me, neighbor, so I can drop by unexpectedly when you're having sex.

566
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What is that?

567
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's the recycle bin dudes.

568
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
They're late today.

569
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I was bank holiday, of course.

570
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's why.

571
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Uh, yeah, here.

572
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This is a sound seeing tour of the cottage recycle pickup.

573
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Recycle it.

574
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't waste it.

575
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Call the recycling hotline.

576
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
143, 445, 084.

577
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
There's a bunch of guys with no t-shirts on outside my house.

578
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Okay.

579
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So, well, that's going out in the background.

580
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's, it's not all irritating.

581
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Uh, make so little say.

582
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
This is what pod casting is all about.

583
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We don't.

584
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What soundproof studios?

585
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
We ain't got no stinking soundproof studios.

586
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
When it comes to the, to the world stage,

587
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
it's all about turf.

588
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's all about money.

589
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's all about who's, who's the boss of who is coming.

590
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yes, coming strip.

591
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Comic strip.

592
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Comic strip.

593
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Comic strip.

594
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Comic strip.

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Can't start a weekend without a note from CSB.

596
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Hello, what I'm carry.

597
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
How are you?

598
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So, I am just a listener of your show.

599
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I would like to suggest you something is a listener.

600
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Namely.

601
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
One of my favorite radio presenters.

602
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He's a number of correspondence who are regular listeners.

603
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Appointed by him to report on subjects such as video games,

604
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
London Underground,

605
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
urban, music, urban music, etc.

606
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The opportunity to become a correspondent is a very, very,

607
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
one and much valued by listeners of this radio presenter.

608
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I, I hereby suggest Adam carried you two,

609
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
we'll appoint some correspondence on various topics

610
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and let them pluck the topics of podcasts

611
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and you would play the short audio reports on a regular basis.

612
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Once a month for example.

613
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I want to hear for being a correspondent on European Union

614
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
but I reckon that several people would want to hear

615
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
as correspondence on various topics and areas of interest.

616
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Just ask your listeners.

617
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So, have a nice weekend mate.

618
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And move your skinny ass out of this fucking gulfot

619
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
to admire the rest of beautiful UK too.

620
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Ciao.

621
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Dude, I admire it plenty.

622
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I saw Portsmouth just the other night.

623
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And tomorrow I'll be flying over Dover

624
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and all kinds of other wonderful places.

625
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's beautiful.

626
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And as a pilot, you have such a different perspective on

627
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the land that you live on.

628
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So, I enjoy it.

629
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You know, comic strip.

630
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I think that's exactly not the way to go.

631
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Everybody, every listener of this show

632
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
as far as I'm concerned is a correspondent.

633
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Whatever's going on in your piece of the world,

634
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
or in your piece of your life.

635
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Let me know about it.

636
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
If you think why does Adam suck so bad on the cowbell,

637
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I just want you to know that I don't really have

638
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
the proper equipment yet because I've been using a pencil.

639
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And the pencil just doesn't have the right,

640
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
the earth or length or weight to really get into the rhythm.

641
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
All right.

642
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So, I want you to know that there are obstacles

643
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
in my cowbell playing, and I'm really trying on.

644
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay.

645
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I told you about the pod safe music.

646
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Some are stuff that we're working on.

647
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Now, I haven't really discussed this with the sales

648
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and marketing team, but just think parks.

649
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Think big parks.

650
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Think all around America.

651
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Think wouldn't it be great if you could go see

652
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
a pod safe music showcase in a really professional environment?

653
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Wouldn't that be cool?

654
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Okay.

655
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Now, there's only a couple of them.

656
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So, and trust me, it's not the mouse house.

657
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Okay.

658
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So, there you go.

659
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Second life.

660
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I got a sign off here.

661
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I can't see tailwinds.

662
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm not a pilot.

663
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I can't do the wider flick.

664
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't even do that stuff anymore, unfortunately.

665
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But I did think of one thing that I could sign off with

666
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
to be to wish you many blow jobs.

667
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So, BJ's at them.

668
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And I'm hoping this catches on because I really want

669
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
to hear comic strip bloggers say,

670
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
the low jobs and then charity,

671
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
or how about, you know, rather small doing it.

672
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They've a good job to be with you at them.

673
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So, there you go, buddy.

674
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
We'll be getting many, and we'll be getting many blow jobs

675
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
in the next week.

676
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Thank you, later.

677
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, man.

678
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
At first, I'm like, no, not another second life comment.

679
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
But then you really pulled it out, man.

680
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I appreciate that.

681
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah, many BJ's to you, man.

682
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
May you receive or shall you give this weekend.

683
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Either one is fine.

684
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Let's have more of those this weekend.

685
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Okay?

686
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Get your ass out of second life.

687
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And let's concentrate on blow jobs.

688
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Much better idea.

689
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
portions of the show brought you by earth link.

690
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The pod show challenge on the way soon brought you by earth link.

691
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You're going to love it.

692
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You're going to be able to participate in wind valuable cash prizes.

693
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And change advertising at the same time.

694
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I know it sounds really hokey, but you can love it.

695
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's different.

696
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I have a lot of fun just prepping for it.

697
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Also, of course, I'll keep you download with her

698
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And if you're looking for a great deal on domain name,

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
go to godaddy.com and upon checkout,

701

use the special promotional code dsc3, dsc number three,

702
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and you'll get your domain name for only $6.95.

703
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And that's it.

704
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
A little bit longer than intended.

705
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
We'll be back to 40 minutes on Monday.

706
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000

I love it.
