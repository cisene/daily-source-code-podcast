00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's the Daily Source Code, with the multinational, Adam Curry.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good job, Cindy.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good waiting, Cass.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you, buddy.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I am from Holland.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Isn't that beer?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Bringing the show to the US.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They said I might want to get a bit of American in me.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I hope you're the first time.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Delta's Yeracharling.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
489.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Did the next generation radio content in my ears?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We don't need no sticky and dirty.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Fantastic.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's Adam Curry.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Charlie, what are you doing with daddy's computer?

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't know.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Danny, Josh, Scott.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, we train hotcasters.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Seriously early in the day.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey, it's DSE for a line.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm telling you now.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I quit.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I quit.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I quit.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm telling you now.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I quit.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I quit.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I quit.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I quit.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I quit.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I quit.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I quit.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I quit.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I quit.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The situation where you shit's there in my face.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Ain't gonna go on no more.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ain't gonna go on no more.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ain't gonna go on no more.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ain't gonna go on no more.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I got my hands dirty while you roll on mine.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
With one eye on the time.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've done my hardest diving.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
For I can't take that hotify.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can't roll me around your tongue no more.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Baby, it's time to clear up your emotion.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I say, baby.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You'll never fall and overboard.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please don't say, baby.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But I'm telling you now.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I quit.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I quit.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I quit.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I quit.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,200
Because loving you is a job I don't need

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,600
Ain't gotta gotta work no more

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,400
I quit, I quit

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,600
The situation's making for me

61
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Ain't gotta gotta work no more

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Ain't gotta gotta work no more

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Ain't gotta gotta work

64
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,200
I hate you, I hate you

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I hate you, I hate you

66
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I hate you, I hate you

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Too late to say your story

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,200
You're just like every other

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Love them, a shot brings out in you

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
You're gonna run and forth

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Come back, and I'm so sorry

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,200
That I can't be your mother

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
And I'm telling you now

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I quit, I quit

75
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Because loving you is a job I don't need

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Ain't gotta gotta work no more

77
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
I quit, I quit

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
The situation's making for me

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Ain't gotta gotta Work no more

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Ain't gotta gotta work no more

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,200
I quit, I quit

82
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I quit, I quit

83
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,400
I quit, I quit

84
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,200
I quit, I quit

85
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Ain't gotta gotta work no more

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Ain't gotta work

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Ila Brown, I quit, brand new on the pod save music network, and you probably know her.

88
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,200
A C, she was season five American Idol Finalist, place number 13, and of course perform

89
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,200
for 35 million viewers. She's put all of her CDs tracks up on the pod save music

90
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,200
that were really like this stuff. Apparently she did the CD in just under two weeks,

91
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,200
right after American Idol Contract expired. She also went to the NCAA to play for

92
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Boston College Eagles. I mean, why not? She's also easy on the eyes. Influences,

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Celine Dion, Natasha Beningfield, Disney songs, Mariah Carey, and so many more. No idea

94
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,200
if she's single. She's probably Sagittarius. Everybody, oh, thank you Jersey Todd

95
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,200
for pointing that one out to me, man. Always right on dude. Coming to you from the curry

96
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
cottage in the affluent suburb of Suri known as Gilford. It's the daily source code episode

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,200
for 89 beautiful, beautiful crisp sunny day today where we've definitely just, you know,

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,200
November 1st, I played pod save for piece boom. We're into winter all of a sudden. It's cold.

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,200
First sub zero temperature. I'll be sending rate, of course. I think we had one or two degrees below

100
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,200
zero last night, some frost on the ground this morning. But it really is that nice.

101
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,200
You know, as long as there's no clouds in this sunshine, it's great for two reasons.

102
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,200
One, it makes you feel really good with that crisp air outside. And two, there's a much less

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,200
or almost zero risk of icing when you're flying in sub zero temperature. You don't want clouds

104
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,200
when it's freezing. Or even when it's, I mean, even if it's nine or 10 degrees on the ground up at

105
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,200
altitude, it could be freezing and could get your icing, could make your fly really, really bad.

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:20,200
No, I'm saying, yes, it's Thursday. Amy Mac. Here to save my ass. Amy.

107
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Hey, baby. That's right. It's time to exercise with Amy Mac.

108
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I'm ready. All right. I think you're going to be pleased with today's exercise.

109
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Oh, yeah, I always have Amy, you know that. It requires some stability, but not a great deal of movement like last week.

110
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Hold on, hold on.

111
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Did you feel those kicks the next day? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold on, Amy.

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Hold on. I got to take off my bathroom. I just want to be prepared, you know, before you get me doing stuff.

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Let me open it the out. The second microphone here.

114
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Let me just check the second. Oh, hey, hold on. Why isn't no working? What the hell?

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Oh, oh, sorry. Didn't mean to hurt you like that. Yeah. Testing one two.

116
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Yes. Okay. Had to turn on the Phantom Power. Okay. Back to Amy Mac.

117
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
That's what I thought. All right. Let's do it.

118
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Okay. Let's get started. Okay. I'm ready.

119
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Stand tall. Stand shoulder with a part.

120
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Feet shoulder with. Now lift your right leg up and straighten it out in front of you.

121
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Okay. Good. Now balance and hold. Okay. I'm balancing and holding. Great.

122
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,200
You probably feel this in your leg. Yeah, my thigh. Yeah. Now take that leg and make eight small circles to the left.

123
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:33,200
While holding your balance. Okay. One two. Head tall, stomach squeeze, three, two, and eight.

124
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,200
And put it down. Now eight small circles to the right.

125
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Please, that's that. Keep it from to be over.

127
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Excellent. Bring that right leg down.

128
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Shake it out. Okay. Shake it out. Good.

129
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
And take your left leg up and straighten it out in front of you.

130
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Okay. It doesn't go all the way out in front of you. Really?

131
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Now balance. Okay. I'm balancing.

132
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Breathing and being small circles to the left.

133
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
One two. Squeeze everything.

134
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Yeah. Yeah. Woo.

135
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Full circles. Don't just wiggle in play.

136
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Okay. Okay. Okay. I did it. And now circle to the right leg.

137
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Oh, I've heard enough. One two.

138
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Stand up tall. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

139
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
You know exactly. I'm sorry.

140
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Bring it. Well, that seemed pointless.

141
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
It really works all those stability muscles and pills and endurance for the legs and butt.

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,200
As you practice, you'll be able to balance longer and do more circles.

143
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Well, that's it for me. Visit me over at fitness.patchow.com

144
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
And until next time.

145
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay. Okay. I can turn off the second microphone.

146
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
There we go. It's better. Okay. Thanks, Amy.

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Did that show launch officially?

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I think this now officially on pod show plus the exercise.

149
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,200
So you can all do all 12 episodes of exercise.

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Back to it's a 12 step program that we have here.

151
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Also fitness attack, Amy Max regular podcast is now also available on Espanol.

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,200
With pod show diva Marta.

153
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Catching my breath here for a second. Let me just check my notes.

154
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Let me see what I got going on today.

155
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Oh, yeah. This was pretty important.

156
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I was aware of this, but I kind of forgotten about it.

157
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
The strip podcast. I've played bits from the strip before.

158
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,200
They always get all the mega celebrities in Vegas.

159
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Who do we listen to? Who do we listen to?

160
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Oh, Chubby Chakra. That's right. That was a really good one.

161
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
But they've always got some kind of celebrity hanging out of the strip podcast.

162
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,200
And they're running a sweepstakes, which I think is coming to an end pretty soon.

163
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
It's a,

164
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Oh, that was an all expenses.

165
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,200
It was a trip to Vietnam on a second. Let me just go to his page for a sec.

166
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Oh, the deadline's been extended. Excellent. Let's see.

167
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Help us pick a new theme song when a prize. Click here.

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Is that it?

169
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Somehow I don't think that's the one. Wait a minute.

170
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Here's the Vegas trip sweepstakes deadline.

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

172
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Oh, it's from Southwest Vacations. Excellent.

173
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Okay. Where do they have?

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Just like you. We love Las Vegas.

175
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Oops.

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
And the strip podcast. Take advantage of our vacation deal.

177
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
The week and experience it throws those Vegas.

178
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Enter to win a trip to the strip. There you go.

179
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
That's what it is. Okay. Go check it out.

180
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,200
At, of course, I'll put a link in the, in the show notes.

181
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Oops. Oh, my words.

182
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,200
It's SteveFrice.com slash podcast.

183
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm pretty sure they have the strip.podshow.com.

184
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I'll put a link in the show notes so you can find it easily.

185
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Now, what the heck happened to my notes here?

186
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
I've been using that Google notebook.

187
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
That's pretty cool.

188
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Because, you know, it can synchronize across any browser.

189
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
So you kind of have your notes nearby.

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
And at your fingertips, regardless of what computer you're on.

191
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
So it's definitely very cool.

192
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Ah, remember this?

193
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Remember this is a November jump out.

194
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
A trace and a plot.

195
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,200
I've seen a reason why I jumped out of trace and should never be forgot.

196
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
So that's the nursery rhyme.

197
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,200
I was hoping you guys would come up with a good rhyme for me.

198
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
So then 400 years people still know about the daily source code.

199
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,200
But I think I kind of received a challenge from a lot of the different listeners when we start talking about flying.

200
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
And I checked it out with Captain Dan.

201
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,200
And it is actually possible for us to fly at night on bonfire night.

202
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,200
And get some footage of us flying over the fireworks and bonfires.

203
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Or as Chris Rockwell says, who will be doing camera from the back seat.

204
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Go up in a plane and if people shoot fireworks at me, fuck yeah, count me in.

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,200
And this is actually, and the reason why I want to do this, besides the fact that it's just cool.

206
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I haven't done any night flying in a while, is I've been thinking about doing a video show called Flying Fools.

207
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,200
And it's since I'm flying anyway.

208
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I meet so many interesting people at airfields, well, certainly all across the UK and different parts of Europe.

209
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,200
But I do hook up with some interesting folks.

210
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I think maybe it would be a cool show to show aviation from a little different side.

211
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
And the people that make aviation happen.

212
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,200
It might be kind of specialist, but I think what better way to start off with the first episode is me being the flying full number one.

213
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Attempting to go film fireworks and bonfires from the air in the dark.

214
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,200
And so of course, Captain Dan is working on making that happen.

215
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I think we have to actually pay to have the airport stay open longer or open up, especially for us.

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
It's going to be interesting.

217
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Actually, I think we're going to pull a bunch of guys who want to do some night flying and they'll all chip in.

218
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Now I got to figure out when and where the bonfires are.

219
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,200
The final member of the fifth, which is Sunday, right?

220
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
But then I get this message.

221
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I had him, it's John from Gielford here again, just following up on yesterday's call about bonfire night seeing Gielford.

222
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Just be filling up with text from there by things, please.

223
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
And I've just noticed that the sign-up side, the department.

224
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
They're only up in the same three, bonfire and fireworks.

225
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
That's the night 7 p.m.

226
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
So, wrap up.

227
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
We'll get to family down there.

228
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
And I got all of them.

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
He's called sign-up down here, we're up on that.

230
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I've looked rough that.

231
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Here's what I'm flying.

232
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Yeah, so I totally want to do that.

233
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
But I got to know, is it Saturday night?

234
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
You said Saturday night.

235
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Are you sure you were right about Saturday?

236
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
What is Sunday then?

237
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Is Guy Fark, I mean, is bonfire night?

238
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Like the night before Christmas?

239
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Is that the night before the fifth?

240
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
And someone's going to help me out here.

241
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Come on.

242
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
The Brits help the yank out because I want to do this.

243
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
But if it's Saturday, I have to know.

244
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
And I kind of planned it all for Sunday.

245
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
So is it Sunday night or Saturday night?

246
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Please help me.

247
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
I love the company.

248
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Hey Adam, it's a, it's a friend in New York City.

249
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
David, a polito, that guitar man from Central Park.

250
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Listen, if you careful what you wish for, brother,

251
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I know you've been saying that you'd like I love the company

252
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
to become part of the Potio Plus family.

253
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Well, if you go to iltc.potio.com, we hooked up.

254
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,200
And we're bringing you a new show every day Monday through Friday

255
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
to show about music, the people that make music.

256
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Once a week, my buddy said Bernstein's coming along.

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
You know, the guy that brought the Beatles to America.

258
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
He really wants to meet you, by the way.

259
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,200
And then, you know, once a week.

260
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Now we're not even quiet.

261
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
We do something called the Wednesday wake-up call.

262
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200
It's all about music's place in politics and social

263
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
conscience.

264
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,200
This phone numbers that everybody can call in and kind of mix it up with everybody else.

265
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
It's really very cool.

266
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Just tell people to show up.

267
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I love the company.

268
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Good.

269
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Welcome aboard.

270
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,200
David at polito is buddy James and sit Bernstein.

271
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I mean, is that spectacular or what?

272
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I love the company.

273
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
ILTC.potio.com.

274
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Great to have you guys on the networking.

275
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I, I so want to hang out with you guys.

276
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
And of course there will be a New York trip in the near future.

277
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
I was so sick the last time I couldn't go and hang out with him.

278
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
But I definitely want to chill with these dudes.

279
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
That's a cool, it's cool company.

280
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Our friend David I polito keeps in New York.

281
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Very, very excited about it.

282
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,200
So we've been producing, man, we've been doing so much.

283
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
We've been producing shows for our launch.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,200
We've been signing all kinds of new podcasts, pod shows, independent

285
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,200
video producers doing some amazing, just amazing shit.

286
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
And I'm really proud about this about an acquisition.

287
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I guess we'd call an acquisition.

288
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
We won't own anything.

289
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,200
But we've got none other than Pete Townsend.

290
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,200
And Rachel Fuller, who will be joining pod show with in the attic.

291
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Which is, I've talked about this before.

292
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,200
And of course I've played a piece of audio of Pete and flaming lips doing

293
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Bobo Riley.

294
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Essentially, as the who are on their on their world tour,

295
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
they're now in Los Angeles.

296
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Every single gig, either just before or after the show,

297
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
it kind of depends on what's going on.

298
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Rachel, who is Pete's girlfriend.

299
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,200
And Pete's son, who does a lot of the production of the show.

300
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,200
They sit down with one or multiple of the bands who opened up for them,

301
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,200
depending on if it's a festival or a straight ahead who gig.

302
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
And they have this air stream trailer, which is completely outfitted

303
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,200
as a production studio audio and video.

304
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
They interview them.

305
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
It's just really like a sit down chill out, have a cup of tea,

306
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
play some songs, talk some shit about the good old days.

307
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,200
And we'll be doing an episode a week.

308
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
I'm really excited about this.

309
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
There's also a contest, a sweepstakes for charity,

310
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,200
that Pete and Rachel have put together with Pete's,

311
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
with the last guitar.

312
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
He's promised not never to smash another guitar,

313
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
though the one he smashed in Tokyo in 2004.

314
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
That's been made into a table.

315
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,200
And they'll be, I guess the sweepstakes,

316
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
there's promotion that they'll be giving that away for charity.

317
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
So details on that coming very soon,

318
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
but I just got to play this one little bit of,

319
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
I'm looking at the video here,

320
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
so you're only gonna hear the audio of,

321
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
see it's Rachel Pete and the flaming lips.

322
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,200
And Pete, Pete goes into the story about a time he dropped acid

323
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
with Keith Moon on an airplane.

324
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
You just kind of listen to a little bit of it, okay?

325
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
This is in the attic, in the trailer, Pete Downson, Rachel Fuller,

326
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
and flaming lips.

327
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I love to become that.

328
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,200
No, I mean, when I took LSD, I never liked it.

329
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I'd always freaked me out.

330
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
I mean, I never could do the blissful, you know,

331
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
see things and be happy and all that sort of.

332
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
So you want to go into a place where all the lost socks were,

333
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
didn't you?

334
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Yeah.

335
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
One.

336
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
No, I mean, quite seriously, as I remember it,

337
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
the big mistake I made was trying to explain this trip that I had

338
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
to Ricky Javez, you know, who he is.

339
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
David, my friend, Dad, I don't know.

340
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Genius.

341
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
He sat there like this, and I took him,

342
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
and then I went up and I went in the plane,

343
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
and I go, oh, she's turning to a pig,

344
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
and I was hearing, you know,

345
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
and suddenly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

346
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I was always in that place where all the fountain pens

347
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
get lost at a bullet point pens, I'm sticking glasses,

348
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
and socks are going at the back of the hand,

349
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
right there.

350
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
And I was in this weird place,

351
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
and I had a voice telling me, go back, go back, go back.

352
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Just looking at me like that, and I said,

353
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,200
anyway, that's really how I began, you know,

354
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
my spiritual thing,

355
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
because when I got back in my body and, you know,

356
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
accepted the fact that I'd actually been out of it.

357
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
I wanted, well, where did I go?

358
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
And he said, oh, but that doesn't,

359
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
that doesn't convince me that doesn't convince me.

360
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
That doesn't convince me.

361
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
You wait until you see this show.

362
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
He goes way into this whole trip,

363
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
into this old experience, he had.

364
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
But there you have it.

365
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Pete Townsend visiting the place where all the lost socks go,

366
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
and where the lost pens turn up.

367
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I love it.

368
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Fantastic.

369
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I'd be kind of avoiding talking about this next topic,

370
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,200
because I've been following along with the Bob Gentry,

371
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
who's been participating in this NBC show called

372
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Star Tomorrow.

373
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
You can find a start.

374
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Star, no, star tomorrow.

375
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
It's start tomorrow.

376
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Star Tomorrow.com.

377
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm not quite sure what the, what the prize is.

378
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
And I have a feeling it's web only.

379
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm not quite sure, however.

380
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
I'll have you know that he is through to the final round,

381
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,200
the top five, so it's the final five,

382
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,200
and he'll be, he'll be vying for,

383
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
for winning this, this competition,

384
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
which, of course, is, you know,

385
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
somewhat like an American idol or whatever,

386
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
but just to remind you, who Bob Gentry is,

387
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm a big fan of the stuff he's doing.

388
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
This has been up on the networks since 2005.

389
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
It's upside down.

390
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Back in time on the source code, everybody.

391
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,200
I've been talking in my last sleep,

392
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
when I'm waking up.

393
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Well, my tongue is tight.

394
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,200
I've been thinking I should leave

395
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,200
instead of waiting for her when the time is right.

396
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,200
I've backed the bags under my eyes.

397
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Well, I've seen enough to know what it's like.

398
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
It's turning me upside down.

399
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

400
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
All I can do is try it.

401
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
When everything's breaking me down,

402
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
looking at me down side out,

403
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,200
well, all rules got changed somehow,

404
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,200
maybe it's suicide,

405
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,200
to stay here and just stick around.

406
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,200
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now,

407
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
till now.

408
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I've been walking in my last sleep,

409
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
when I'm waking up.

410
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Well, my legs are tight.

411
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,200
I've been thinking I should leave

412
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
but though in the world,

413
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
it's a matter tonight.

414
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Well, I've been thinking I should leave

415
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
but though in the world,

416
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
it's a matter tonight.

417
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I've been dreaming I could fly it.

418
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Well, I'm free enough,

419
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
but I'm still way down.

420
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
It's turning me upside down.

421
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

422
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,200
All I can do is try it.

423
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
When everything's breaking me down,

424
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
looking at me down side out,

425
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
well, all rules got changed somehow,

426
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
maybe it's suicide,

427
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
to stay here and just stick around.

428
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now,

429
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,200
till now.

430
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I've been a friend to just walk out.

431
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,200
You know where to stop me down.

432
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
It's turning me upside down.

433
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

434
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
All I can do is try it.

435
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
When everything's breaking me down,

436
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
looking at me down side out,

437
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,200
well, all rules got changed somehow,

438
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
maybe it's suicide.

439
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Well, I'm free enough,

440
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
but though in the world,

441
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
it's a matter tonight.

442
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Well, all rules got changed somehow,

443
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
maybe it's suicide.

444
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:30,200
To stay here and just stick around.

445
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now,

446
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,200
till now.

447
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

448
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
All I can do is try it.

449
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
When all rules got changed somehow,

450
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,200
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now,

451
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,200
until now.

452
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Oh yeah.

453
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
So good to hear that again.

454
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Bob Gentry, upside down,

455
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
you could find him at the pod state of music network.

456
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,200
And hopefully the winner of NBC's Star Tomorrow.

457
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
I see, I didn't even realize this.

458
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
He's just, he put up a new song on October 6.

459
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
What does that sound like?

460
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
I'm playing this directly from the web,

461
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,200
by the way, from the pod team music network.

462
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Oh, you know, it's going to be another

463
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
gentry classic for sure.

464
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Listen to that.

465
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Oh, I got to listen that whole song.

466
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Maybe I'll play it for you on tomorrow's Who Bar Friday.

467
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Okay, let me see.

468
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Oh, you'll love this.

469
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Trucker Tom here. Hey, guess what?

470
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,200
My 81 year old mom is podcasting.

471
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I want you all to join us in RVing and knowing the good,

472
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
the ends and the outs, the good and the bad and the ugly.

473
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,200
It was her idea. She wanted to start a podcast.

474
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,200
I just wanted to tell you that we're not young people anymore,

475
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,200
but we still have a taste for adventure.

476
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,200
And thanks to cast blaster and pod show working together,

477
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,200
it was easy to set her up with the podcast.

478
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Happy to share my mom with the world at RViddits.podshow.com.

479
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Be good to yourselves and I'll let you know when we start our adventure.

480
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Bye, bye.

481
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
I'm waiting to hear that first show is fantastic.

482
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
What's your 81 RViddits.podshow.com?

483
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Fantastic. Thank you so much, Trucker Tom.

484
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
And I'm glad that I worked out with cast blaster.

485
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Once you kind of figured out,

486
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,200
it's really simple because all you do is you record the show.

487
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
You fill out the information, they show notes and some other data.

488
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
They'll help people identify what the show is,

489
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:01,200
what it's about, even your album art and you click upload.

490
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,200
And that's it. There is no step three, essentially.

491
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I'd love to hear from you guys on the voice mail lines.

492
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Lots of Brits calling in these days.

493
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Even though I'm giving out the US number pretty much exclusively these days.

494
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
But in case you forgot.

495
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
I had a meal for three days.

496
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I've just been listening to four eight nights.

497
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:47,200
And your comments regarding the audio quality of the report from Jera and Martin Upper in the city.

498
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
And it's what I'm going to say.

499
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I don't know if it's been for somebody else.

500
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,200
That was produced at my first podcast of the quarter.

501
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Next that idea makes a product out of it.

502
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,200
You know, something with bright colors and big buttons.

503
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,200
For the album coming, you just know the tomorrow to record their content on.

504
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
So I'd like me chuckle that one.

505
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,200
That's just a photo of that.

506
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,200
And yeah, thank you so much.

507
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Thanks, Neil.

508
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Yeah, I don't know what was up with that.

509
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
That was I still got to get to the bottom of that.

510
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,200
What they were using up there in Manchester.

511
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I think Spotlight.podshow.com is where they've uploaded more stuff.

512
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
I'll check for you and put a link in the show notes.

513
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Because it definitely was a lot going on.

514
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
I'd up in Manchester in the city.

515
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,200
And I'm sure that Jill and GD got GM and GD.

516
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I should say.

517
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
They got plenty of new artists on the podcast music network.

518
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,200
And hopefully it turned a lot of artists there on to the whole pod safe music movement

519
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
and to pod casting in general, et cetera.

520
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,200
But the idea of my first podcast, or actually Katja, who does Katja's cast,

521
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
the Kat's cast.

522
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,200
I should say KAT, C-A-S-C-A-S-T dot podshow.com.

523
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,200
She actually did a design of my first podcast recorder.

524
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
She never really finished the technological bit,

525
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
and we were kind of halfway through cast blaster.

526
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
But now that I think about it, this is very much what cast blaster

527
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
might always envision for cast blaster.

528
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Find that at castblaster.com, by the way.

529
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,200
You can use it for free for anything under 10 minutes,

530
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
and then there's $50 for a lifetime license.

531
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Five, actually, should you change computers five times in the meantime?

532
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,200
And I think it would be as simple as creating a new skin.

533
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
I'm not quite sure how it works, and when it does applications,

534
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,200
but I'm pretty sure there's a lot of people who know how it works.

535
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,200
And I guess if you can create a photo shop file that can be cut into bits

536
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
or pieces, it can be done.

537
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,200
But Mike is on vacation currently until,

538
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
well, until, remember, remember the fifth of November.

539
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
When he gets back, I'll see if I can have a chat with him about it.

540
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
And also want to tell you that, you know, we're all very excited about the launch of

541
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,200
BTPodShow.com, which is on the 7th of November.

542
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Remember, remember, the 7th of November.

543
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,200
When we'll be bringing you lots of flavour from Splenda.

544
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,200
But we're also launching the new version of PodShow Plus,

545
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
to be found at podShow.com.

546
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
And I think we've really nailed it this time.

547
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,200
You know, it's only been, was it four months since our first unleash,

548
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,200
and we've learned quite a bit, and we've figured out,

549
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I think what it really takes to have a social media network,

550
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
so we've really divided it up into four pieces.

551
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
You're going to love this when it comes out.

552
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Which will be November, I'm sorry, November 9th.

553
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
The second week of November, whatever.

554
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Somewhere around there, I don't want to have everyone sitting around waiting.

555
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,200
We've divided it into people, which, of course,

556
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,200
is the Plus part, PodShow Plus music, which, of course,

557
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
is the PodSet Music Network.

558
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Shows, which, of course, encompasses all things,

559
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
podcasting, anything that's serialized.

560
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,200
And then a new addition, videos, which I think we really got

561
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,200
a cool video system that you'll be able to upload single videos

562
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
to that you know, you may not want to actually have a show

563
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,200
within RSS feed, or you may want to take advantage of our online

564
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,200
editing system, which will just fucking knock your socks off.

565
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Imagine that upload some music, which you can get from the PodSet Music

566
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Network, upload some graphics, some pictures.

567
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
You could get that somewhere from your gallery at PodShow Plus,

568
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,200
upload pieces of video, and then you can, you know,

569
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
put it all in a timeline, and put transitions in, and, and,

570
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,200
and out the back end, poop, say, a full edited video.

571
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
It's really fucking amazing.

572
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
It's, it's exactly the stuff that I've been begging for.

573
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
So I think you'll really, really like it.

574
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Also, a way to monetize that if you don't want to use advertising

575
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,200
based monetization, or just to let people embed that

576
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,200
on other pages, you know, very much the YouTube Google

577
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
video concept.

578
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,200
But the nice thing is that you can easily then put it

579
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,200
into a show at PodShow Plus, you know, single click stuff.

580
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
We've changed how collections work.

581
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Now you can actually create, um, I'm just going to

582
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
ramble on for a second.

583
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
What the hell is that outside?

584
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Mail truck.

585
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Uh, you'll be able to create a feed of individual items.

586
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
So, you know, already you can say, well, let me just put a feed

587
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
together of, of shows.

588
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
So I have my new show, and, you know, whenever there's a new episode

589
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,200
of any of the shows that I have in that channel in my

590
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
collection, it'll, you know, it'll essentially drop out

591
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
into my iPod, or I have it on my Nokia,

592
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
and 91 cell phone.

593
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
So I'm still liking for the, for the podcast portion of it.

594
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Uh, but now you could also put together a feed very much like

595
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
gigadile, as you know, Andrew Grummit created gigadile.

596
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
You can see gigadile.net.

597
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Um, so now you can say, well, I'm just going to put together a feed

598
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,200
and that feed will only consist of singular items that I put in

599
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
there. So you could even make it private.

600
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
So I could set up a feed for Patricia.

601
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,200
And whenever I found a, you know, a great show, not not a,

602
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,200
I'm really an individual episode, or, or a great, um,

603
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,200
a great video that I wanted to see, or even just a picture.

604
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Then I can put it into that feed, and it will automatically update

605
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
on, uh, on that private channel we have on podgeo

606
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
plus or on her iPod or on, well,

607
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,200
G, her set top box or any of the other myriad of distribution

608
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
devices. We've been working on with people.

609
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
So I'm, I'm really getting excited about this.

610
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Look for that to launch second week of November.

611
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Oh, sorry. Hey, Adam, my name is Logan,

612
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
and I'm a broadcast journalism student, CSU Fresno.

613
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
I'm also working on filmmaking, screenwriting,

614
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
which brings me to my question.

615
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Online video has finally been taken up by major broadcasters.

616
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,200
The big four TV networks are now supplying back episodes for free.

617
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Cable shows. You can now buy on iTunes,

618
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
and even shows like Battlestar Galactica,

619
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
producing quote unquote webisodes

620
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
that are intended exclusively for an online audience.

621
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Right now our independent video podcasts are predominantly

622
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
nonfiction,

623
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Dignation Room of Rules, Gaper TV,

624
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
or the other variety show type.

625
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Tiki Bar TV or Askin Ninja easily come to mind.

626
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
So finally, my question.

627
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Has podcasting matured enough to lure professional

628
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
if not union talent for dramatic and genre shows.

629
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
And our advertisers and podgeo

630
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,200
ready to begin work with show creators and producers

631
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
on making shows with a good production value.

632
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Thanks, Adam. I love the source code,

633
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
and I'm always glad to see a new one up here on my iPod.

634
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Yeah, buddy. Well, let me answer this question for you.

635
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
First of all, I take slight offense to the

636
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
quote good production values.

637
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
That's horseshit.

638
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
You can create good production values

639
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
if you're in an attic somewhere,

640
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
or let's anywhere in the world

641
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
that you have a computer.

642
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
You can create something with great production values.

643
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
I mean, that's just horseshit.

644
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
There's nothing to do with someone who's quote professional or not.

645
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Is the industry ready?

646
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Yeah, what are you talking about?

647
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
I mean, I've been doing this for almost two years.

648
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
No, I've been doing it for two years.

649
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
I'm a code professional.

650
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Lots of people are in it.

651
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Now, what are we doing about that?

652
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Yeah, absolutely.

653
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
We're opening up a studio in Los Angeles.

654
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
We have a studio now in London.

655
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
You know, it's office studio.

656
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
So, you know, there's work going on.

657
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,200
That's cool. That's kind of in the background.

658
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,200
We're working on licensing

659
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,200
with ASCAP BMI to expand that if it all possible.

660
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,200
But, you know, forget about whether that's possible or not.

661
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,200
There's plenty, plenty of professional talent on the pod save music.

662
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Now, work, look at what's coming on board.

663
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Look at the fantastic artists who we have.

664
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
There are definitely mainstream names.

665
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Yeah, we've been working with people here in the UK with the OJ

666
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
and Olivia.

667
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
They're quote unquote professional talent.

668
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,200
The only thing that will be problematic is the concept of union.

669
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,200
This is the one thing that really has to change across the board.

670
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,200
We've changed it in music licensing with the pod save music network license.

671
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,200
We'll have to do something similar with the talent

672
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
because it's just not going to play out.

673
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,200
You know, the audiences aren't going to be large enough

674
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
and it's just not going to make any sense

675
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,200
with the free distribution model that, you know, that's the path

676
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
that we seem to be going down.

677
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
There's no way you can tell anymore where something's been played or repropagated.

678
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,200
So it's pretty much going to be buy out for everybody when they do something.

679
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Or a share in revenue, either one, but not like a union where you have unionized rates.

680
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
I just don't see that happening.

681
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
There's too many variables.

682
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
We've ready for it.

683
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Dude, we're deep into it, right in the middle of it.

684
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
And it's very, very exciting to me.

685
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,200
And we're getting lots of refugees from the broadcast industry.

686
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,200
One last song for you today from British Columbia.

687
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I've played her before on the show.

688
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,200
And I like her.

689
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Yeah, and when she's got the Levi's on,

690
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
and she's got,

691
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
oh, that's second.

692
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Do I have the right, I'm thinking, do I,

693
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,200
is this the right, I don't think I have the right song queueed up.

694
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Crap, how do I do that?

695
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Oh, I see what I did.

696
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
I queueed up the same song twice.

697
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Hold on.

698
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Here it is.

699
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
It was right underneath it.

700
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Yeah, cowboy hat and Levi's cowboy boots and Levi's.

701
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
That's what it is.

702
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
It's a little bit of country on the DSC,

703
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
and it's coming from something that ain't hard on the eyes.

704
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Kelly Brock.

705
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I wonder,

706
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,200
this cowboy wearing a country?

707
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Yeah.

708
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I love to watch and walk.

709
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,200
That boy could put in a healthy girl in shock.

710
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
He makes some of the ladies say.

711
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,200
In his cowboy boots and Levi's.

712
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,200
In his cowboy boots and Levi's.

713
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,200
But boy's got style is number one of the shots.

714
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
I wouldn't forget,

715
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
but I'll make a break your heart.

716
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
It's just a little more.

722
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
It's one of the modern nights.

723
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
That keeps on short.

724
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,200
That's everything we've got to let you play.

725
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
But boy can't play.

726

It was my my body, like it's on your head

767

I've learned while surfing the internet

776
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Number one, entering your email address on some websites

777
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Is an open invitation to spam

778
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Number two, before forwarding an email about the ghost

779
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200

00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Check Snopes.com first

782
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200

00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
The FBI will never send you an email

787

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
They'll simply bust down your door

789
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Never, ever, Google the Toronto-based quartet

790
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200

791
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,200

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Number eight, there is no ousted prints in Bangladesh

797
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Willing to share $15 million with you

798
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Closing one porn pop-up window opens 15 more

799
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200

801
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,200
