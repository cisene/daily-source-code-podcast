1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Shara Charly 3-1

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
7-

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
3 minutes?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We don't need no thinking 3 minutes?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jar

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Fantastic!

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a battle curry

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you may be

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is your daily source code coming to you once again from the

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And this moment kind of dark and chilly

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh man!

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Northern California, it's a hit for Cisco, direct from the condo

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Kicking off with the butterfly catchers

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We come, wake up and climb

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You've been asleep so long, I die

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No, not just a time

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Get up and climb

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't you realize we could set the world apart

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Because here I am

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm coming to say that

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Even if you don't want to be safe

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well here I am

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm coming to get you

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Think we know I like just for this day

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're so annoying

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I know you've been trying

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Just trying to make it through the day

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You've been lying

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can't cry

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But believe me, baby

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Where I say

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We've done

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We've done

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We've done

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Wake up and sing

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Stand up

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Stand up and shout

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You and I salute you, can't find your way out

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm coming to say that

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Even if you don't want to be safe

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah here I am

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm coming to get you

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Think we know I like just for this day

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Think we know I like just for this day

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Think we know I like just for this day

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Think we know I like just for this day

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're so annoying

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I know you've been trying

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Just trying to make it through the day

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You've been lying

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can't cry

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But believe me, baby

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Where I say

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We've done

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We've done

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wake up to me

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We've done

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We've done

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We've done

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We've done

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're so annoying

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I know you've been trying

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Just trying to make it through the day

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Think we know we like just for this day

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Think we know I like just for this day

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Think we know I like just for this day

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Think we know I like just for this day

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:55,360
And then pretty song, butterfly catchers wake up from the potsafe music network.

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,040
So you can find the music.punch.com, direct link, we'll show up in the show notes.

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:09,520
And a wonderful start of the show with that fine audio skipping problem in my $2.5,000

73
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,720
power book.

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,080
I figured I'd just let it go, I wasn't going to restart the show or anything, because

75
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,000
at least we've had it right, it's behind us and hopefully it won't happen again.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,200
So it's Tuesday, I thought that was kind of a nice tune, you know, to ease us into Tuesday

77
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,280
and kind of, you know, like the week is already started, we're not halfway, you know,

78
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
just kind of chill.

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,280
I think I've actually played that song before, but I was listening last night before I went

80
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
to bed.

81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,840
I was listening to the ultimate mix podcast, ultimate mix dot blogspot.com and it was actually

82
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,160
was a very mellow show by itself, and there were a whole bunch of really good tunes,

83
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,960
including the butterfly catchers, so I figured I'd play that for you.

84
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,320
It's been a long, long day, yeah, shoot, I don't know, what is it, maybe 16 hour

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,560
day, it feels like it's, it is technically, it's actually Tuesday just about everywhere

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:09,640
in the world now, but I'm just kind of getting back from from a late late dinner, and

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:19,920
of course, a long day at Pod Show headquarters, man, it was holiday, Martin Luther King day,

88
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,480
and it was not compulsory to come to work, but just by everybody showed up anyway, which

89
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
is very cool.

90
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,080
I'm missing some of my acute come on here, let me see, one of my missing, I don't have

91
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,920
my, oh my gosh, we'll never be able to end the show because I don't have my lighter,

92
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,480
my T is just out of reach and this microphone doesn't have the same dynamics as it does

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,680
back at the cottage.

94
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,760
So there's going to be a lot of cool stuff coming up this week.

95
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,360
Now for those of you who haven't been listening to the source code since it started, which

96
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,960
was well over a year and a half ago, this really is the show we test out a lot of stuff.

97
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,360
In fact, it started out as a show that really was just for software developers, and

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,440
I would tell them about my experiences with their software, and they would use my show

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,440
to test their software, and it got a lot of things rolling in the Pod Catching community,

100
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,600
the software developers predominantly, and as we're getting ready to start to roll out

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,880
the Pod Show Pod Cast delivery network, it's just a part of the Pod Cast network itself.

102
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,080
We're going to be testing it on this show, so expect stuff to be all over the map, and

103
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,160
expect weird stuff to show up, and I'm hoping that you will help me out and give me your

104
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
feedback.

105
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,600
You guys have been great, all listeners have been fantastic, not just give me feedback on the

106
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,920
content of the show, but the audio quality about feeds that are breaking about download

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,240
issues, so it's very, very helpful, and I'm just kind of for warning you right up front,

108
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,000
that stuff is definitely going to be all over the map, so that should probably start happening.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,800
I hope as soon as tomorrow, and from then we're going to start moving in some new podcasters

110
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,880
who are joining the network, and of course, we'll be migrating our existing Pod Squad into

111
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,000
the new architecture, so it's just so much happening, and here's another guy who's going to be

112
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:20,800
part of the big mess, hitting you right between the years with the message of hope, love, and

113
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,080
good news, this is LifeSpring. Hey Adam Steve Web here, wow, who would have thought back

114
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,560
well, Tunnel members ago, when you played the very first LifeSpring promo back when you were at the

115
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,720
Curry Castle, that a scant 14 months later, the LifeSpring podcast would be a part of the greatest

116
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:48,080
podcasnet work in the world, podshow, as you know, I was one of the original godcasters, and now,

117
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,120
partnering with podshow, we can really kick it up enough enough. I'm telling you, I love

118
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,800
religious podcasters. Excellent, thanks Adam for the invitation, and I'm really looking forward to

119
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,760
quitting my day job, and thanks everybody for listening. I'm out of here.

120
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Thanks everybody. Oh man, perfect. It seems like it doesn't even seem that long ago, and then again,

121
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,160
when you hear that audio, you think, wow, that was a long time ago. Well, we welcome the LifeSpring

122
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:31,280
podcast Steve Web into the podshow podcasnet work, and it's great to see a godcaster jumping on board,

123
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,080
and just having all kinds of fantastic ideas about where we can take pod casting, very excited about

124
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,880
it, Steve, and great to have you on board. Let me see, we're going to be, we will do a brief

125
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,440
Metrosexual moment. I tried to plan a little bit earlier, so our friends on the satellite,

126
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,240
a serious satellite star is 103, who sometimes missed the Trinity and the Multi, the Multi-sexual.

127
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,520
Yeah, there you go. The Metrosexual moment. I got to tell you the story. I had dinner with Ron and his wife

128
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:14,720
Marta, and they were at a family function over the weekend, and I think the conversation came

129
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:26,640
down to women's handbags, and I think it was basically a fashion conversation, and Marta loves

130
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,360
handbags, and actually I've been shopping with Ron. I've been pretty impressed when he knew exactly

131
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:42,320
which handbag to pick out as a gift, and Marta bless her heart. So the conversation came up about

132
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,800
Ron having this, this knack, this capability, this skill set, and they were in a restaurant.

133
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,920
She said, well, you know, my husband is the true transsexual, and of course she meant Metrosexual.

134
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,120
Needless to say, down there in Atlanta, they were pretty surprised about Mr. Bloom and his many

135
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:17,840
many talents. Hey Adam, I'm a relatively new listener. My name is Alex. I am totally hooked

136
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,240
to podcasting. I can't wait to get my show off the road. I anxiously await the pod show delivery

137
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:32,880
network is a first thing to put my podcast together. A comment about advertising effectiveness.

138
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Since listening to your show, I purchased or I've had bought for me basically because I asked

139
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,920
the following items. And I dog, the mock three turbo razor, egg knot, countless songs on iTunes,

140
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:53,760
music store, a bunch of songs are downloaded from the pod safe music network, which I will gladly

141
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:02,480
pay for. And a $300 connection for the iPod to play in my new car. But here's the best.

142
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:12,240
I've actually switched from a lifetime of MSDOS based PC machines. And last week, I purchased a totally

143
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:22,320
souped up power book G4. That's right. I have become a Mac user directly because of your

144
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:30,000
comments regarding Apple computer products. Thank you. Thank you. All right. All right. Calm down.

145
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,240
I apologize. It's just an operating system for crying out loud. Directly because your comments

146
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,160
I decided to actually go to a store and look at the Mac in detail and I fell in love with it.

147
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,640
I can't thank you enough for pushing me in this direction. As far as the coffee machine,

148
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,160
I think I'll stick with my Nespresso by Nestle. Nothing can come close to this product.

149
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,080
Not even your beloved Sinceo. I will be highlighting Nespresso on my podcast and hope to get Nestle

150
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,760
as a sponsor. Wait a minute. I don't have a podcast yet. Fuck.

151
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:17,120
Damn. Okay. It's a good podcast that I want to do. About last father's day, my wife and

152
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,320
kids bought me a brand new guitar. I've always wanted to play. And this Christmas, I received

153
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,360
guitar lessons. My podcast will be one man's journey to learn to play the guitar the hard way.

154
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
Sixth string torture is going to be the name of it. It's going to be an acoustic guitar program

155
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,920
featuring indie artists from the pod save music network from garage band from my space.

156
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:49,360
Any other independent artists source I can find. Each episode, I want to devote a segment

157
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,880
also to promos of other acoustic podcasts like acoustic cafes, outstanding. I'd like to do an

158
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,560
IMAX moment that highlights and lists the songs that are in a acoustic IMAX on iTunes.

159
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm not going to play the music. I'm just going to discuss what's available, the free download,

160
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:17,280
the week, etc. And finally, the meat of the podcast will be a torture me section.

161
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,400
It's going to be a segment which I review and discuss in sample and internet related learn how to

162
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,040
play guitar site. There's a lot of them on the site. I'll also play clips from my real guitar lessons

163
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,080
so you can hear my instructor torture me while simultaneously being tortured by my playing.

164
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,680
I need help putting this together at him. It seems so friggin easy, but I just can't get over the

165
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,120
hump of designing the actual show. If there's anyone a pod show that can help me, I would be forever

166
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,800
grateful. I need equipment too, at least I think I do. I have a great mic, headphones, my new

167
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,280
power book, and with the new I web and garage band, I probably have what I need. I don't have a mixer

168
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,720
and I don't have a mobile recording device yet. Hey wait, I have an idea. Since Chris Rockwell's

169
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,480
being such a loser and literally not giving a shit to us anymore, maybe he can donate his equipment

170
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:20,400
to someone that will actually put it to good use. Thanks again for doing what you do and doing

171
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,080
what you do to make what we are doing doable. Hey don't steal that phrase, that phrase pal.

172
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:34,400
It's a line of one of my new songs. I told you my music was the torture. Take care and have a happy

173
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,160
and healthy process me. Thanks again. Nobody listen. Now the reason why I played this for you

174
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,040
for basically a promo for a podcast that doesn't yet exist is I just want you here that thinking

175
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,320
because this is literally how simple it is. Actually, I think he's gone quite far in this thinking

176
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,520
about he's actually describing a format of a show. It's something he's passionate about, something

177
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,840
that he'll be able to, it goes along with a pair of parallels and interest that he already has.

178
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,560
I'll be tracking the podcast. This is kind of interesting because now I've been able to hear

179
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,000
the idea from inception, looking forward to hearing how execution goes. Of course,

180
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,040
it seems like a lot of work to get a podcast together when you listen to that and that of course

181
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,000
is a part of what I'll be testing out this week is a lot of those tools that make it really

182
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,280
as simple as just recording, filling out your show notes and clicking a button. Everything else

183
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,160
is more or less done for you. There's something else I was going to say. Oh yes about pod

184
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,040
safe music this morning when I got a bless Chris, Chris Rockwell's hard man. So he's back

185
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,000
and I had a whole dealing with all kinds of family business but still he's on the machine and

186
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,160
he sent me a link and today I actually made my first purchase of a track off the pod safe music

187
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,160
network and it was just the, I mean it's funny because of course I've done a store before,

188
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,640
you know I bought something online but to see it actually work and then to have the track

189
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,600
right there the download it and have it play it was just it was a great experience so it completely works

190
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,560
and we're working on some some design stuff and well then of course we have to complete

191
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,880
the terms for artists who are interested in participating and then we're going to just open it

192
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,840
up you know we're going to blow it out with anyone who wants to sell their tracks so it's not compulsory

193
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,160
they don't have to which of course for listeners will be a great way for you to support the artist

194
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,360
that the music you love you can download the tracks MP3's in the clear you can copy them onto

195
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:42,320
as many machines and devices as you have and and it's a great way to support as I said a great

196
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,320
way to support your artist for pod castes of course who are members of the pod the pod

197
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,960
safe music network the deal remains the same you're allowed to download these songs for free

198
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
and to play them on your podcast as long as you report that play back into the network.

199
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,000
Hi Adam this is Andy from the polar bear pod cast. I listened to your DSC 316 and in your

200
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,320
training to segment you mentioned your trip to IKEA and as a sweet I of course felt very proud.

201
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,560
I've been talking a great deal about IKEA on my podcast since I seem to be the ambassador for

202
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,680
Sweden in the pod is fear. For us IKEA has become somewhat of a national trademark and it's

203
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,760
impressive that this now global multi-million dollar company won't start it off in a basement in

204
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,440
Elmhurl Sweden and you should know that it has grown to what it is today in only one generation

205
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,680
and it's all thanks to one single guy in your account pad there's an entrepreneur for you

206
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,480
Since I know that you're a traveling man I just thought I'd let you know that

207
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,800
IKEA is opening their first door into pad in April so you might want to pop over there and check that out

208
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,560
although I believe it will look just the same as a story you visited except from the science being

209
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:03,520
fairly hard to read but maybe you're fluent in Japanese as well as English Dutch and god knows what

210
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,480
love the show Adam I don't miss a single episode so keep up the good work and if by any chance

211
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,040
your Mac will start staggering in this clip it's okay now at least we know you just have too many

212
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,080

223
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,520
i know someone has emailed me about this before about a blue ocean business because on to say

224
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,520
basically you're creating a business which is breaking the boundaries of the radio and recording

225
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,480
industry building a business in an uncontested area keep it up fantastic love listen to the show

226
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,760
tailwinds i just want to know does everyone who says tailwinds are they actually a pilot

227
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,200
i'm gonna have to consider that you are if you say tailwinds that's got to be and we've got to keep

228
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,040
some things exclusive to the to the airman and airwomen you know uh thank you very much

appreciate it oh you know i got a hurry up here because we have uh only a few more minutes

230
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:27,600
was sadly metronome yeah yeah yeah the Greg man uh was kind of happy that i coped

231
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,120
to having uh been more or less addicted to the figure skating championships and really enjoying

232
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,200
watching them he says uh Megan Hyde is my roommate's niece that's like a Kevin Bacon

233
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,560
six degrees of separation so our house has been figure skating crates the past few days

234
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,200
yes you actually want i think the junior championships it's all about the double axle and the

235
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,200
tollets and all that's you know my mom actually uh was a uh i think i said my professional figure

236
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,560
skater and uh i still remember i think the last time i saw her she was uh over 50 still on the ice

237
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,440
doing uh doing some well tricks that i thought at least were pretty damn impressive

238
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:14,880
uh let me see here mister Adam says uh who's this from video flat okay having this

239
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
almost three months worth of your informative yet interesting podcast i could not wait to send

240
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,120
my small collaboration there are too many subjects to have an opinion on so i'll start with

241
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,360
the subject of shaving shaving must be the most damaging action one can take against one's face

242
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,840
so careful consideration has to be taken i shave under a hot shower only hot when i shave

243
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,240
i use the big double blades for sensitive skin the ones you'll find uh in the supermarket anywhere

244
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,840
for four bucks it does and i use target shaving cream in 139 made with the same ingredients as

245
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,160
the gelette it looks even the same with the blue gel now you would ask how can you shave with such

246
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,360
cheap blades and cream well very carefully shaving is damaging to the skin so one has to take

247
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,000
the time to do it right time is of the essence that's how you get the best results

248
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,960
once you finish the task i recommend using neutrogena cleanser that's where you spend the money

249
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,920
you know i really appreciate this kind of feedback because uh we just don't get to talk about

250
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,920
this stuff enough you know as guys kind of amongst ourselves and once again we have uh a woman

251
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,520
checking into the metro sexual moment Elizabeth Bonne stale says not to get too personal but

252
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,840
the more stubble my husband is sporting the less i want to wear to bed gentlemen it's just one of

253
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:40,640
the things that you learn right here on the metro sexual moment yeah yeah okay friends on the

268
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:07,200
like that song a lot it was it was very trippy and uh following up on an idea had uh several source

269
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,760
codes go hey Adam says Derek's dean or stain been listening since around July oh five when iTunes

270
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,680
got the podcast feature loving every moment we wanted to email you from many different things

271
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,160
we never got around to it until now listening to DSC 313 where you were talking about the idea

272
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,000
of a car cast of thought of this idea too boy what i love the test time some Subaru TSTIs

273
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,240
and many other test world the cars and broad i mean make that pod cast it to the world i live

274
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,840
in Sydney australia you know i gotta get down to Sydney man there's it's just the australia

275
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,800
there's so much going on it's just such a you know if i could find a real good business reason

276
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,200
that would make it even but i i don't think i can get the girls unless it's like the

277
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,080
the big summer vacation i can't get them down that far um and we got the dogs and the cats

278
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,240
and all that crap and it's just you know you really got to spend at least two weeks in australia

279
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,320
when you have to make the trip really worthwhile but i really want to come and visit i really really

280
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,760
do let's find a business reason to go anyway i live in Sydney australia so i'd have the right

281
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,160
hand drive thing going i could easily look the part the only hitch is i'm nineteen into rent

282
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,800
cars you have to be twenty one here not sure about test driving i'd be interested to know

283
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,320
what becomes of the car cast you know we talked about this today at the office and i think we

284
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,200
really should put this together um and the model that i have here is not not really a commercial one

285
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,080
because i'm a big fan of top gear on the BBC and the reason why that show is so good the reason

286
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,400
why it wanted i think in any award at the most recent awards is because they're not sponsored by any

287
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,000
car manufacturer and they just you know they're so brutally honest and it's a funny show it's

288
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,440
well produced well put together um on the google video go ahead and just search for top gear and

289
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,440
you'll find many of their episode or not not full episodes but at least you'll find some of

290
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,960
their test drives that they've done it's really fantastic stuff so the concept here is uh we just

291
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,400
do test drives but you know i'm thinking ten minutes um where you either do a test drive in a in a

292
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,800
car a new car or rent a car you should be really easy in Los Angeles there was this budget rent

293
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:22,160
a car and you could say i want a rolls or i want you know uh BMW Z8 or uh Ferrari or a Corvette whatever

294
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,560
you wanted uh they'd bring for you i don't think you have a rental place like that in San Francisco but

295
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,560
i don't think it just ten minutes you know and we have a basic format of the description about how

296
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,080
the car feels how it rides this suspension and anything just you know imagine you know you've been

297
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,200
in in my in three of my cars now if you've been listening for a while and uh and people always

298
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,440
seem to enjoy just you know cranking up the sound and listening to the ambient noise and you can

299
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,920
really using your theater of the mind you can really get into actually being there um so working on

300
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,480
that if anyone knows of many places where we can rent uh all different kinds of vehicles in the bay area

301
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,000
let me know uh because there's no better place to start than right here right here in my second

302

to you entitled lonely wait let's do it like this lonely i've been keeping myself to myself this

317
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,800
last week i found the nice website that has lots of free passwords for porn sites so i've been busy

318
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,080
checking those out a lady emailed mister Adam Curry saying that she had a bad reaction when she

319
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,960
heard my voice that's not the first time a lady has had that reaction and reported me i've discussed

320
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,240
these matters last night with my therapist and we both came to the conclusion that the last thing i

321
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,840
want is to upset Adam's audience i don't want Adam to lose any audience because of my interactions

322
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,400
with him even mad just upset with me for no reason i know that Adam understands my feelings and

323
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,680
knows i would never do anything to harm him listening to him seems he seems so very busy these

324
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,960
days jet setting and whatnot i wish i could help him in some way even if it's just a tidy up

325
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,040
those plants by a dry way i don't mind doing it i know i have no experience in running a million

326
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:04,000
dollar company but i can always leave him to do that in his study area whilst i perform task deemed

327
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,520
too meanial for him if it's just cleaning his car taking his dirty clothes to the laundry or

328
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:18,160
mowing a lawn if Adam does not do these then he can record more shows it's just no good when

329
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,600
he's not in the country i don't know what to do with myself in the evenings i don't know what to do

330
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,520

331
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,920

341
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,960
pod save music this is something cc Chapman turned me on to very i have to agree with and very much

342
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,120
a seal type vibe to this guy frances jockey my life on the daily source code

343
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:27,440

baby it's my life

351
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:40,180
Every day I woke up at this morning, we looked around, we were gazing at it

352
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:57,180
Easy, easy, my life Baby it's my life, yeah, just be my life

It's my life Baby, be gone, whatever you say you say you say you say you say

355
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:46,180
You say, yes, you say

356
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:53,180
You know what also has a bit of a like a Robert Palmer vibe too

357
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,180
Francis Chockey, my life from the pot, the same music.net where music.pot showed our calm thanks to CCC

358
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,700
the Chapman accident hash and the U-turn cafe,

359
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,860
but pointing that one out to me.

360
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,700
And if you have any suggestions, any songs

361
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,700
that you was in a listener might have run across

362
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,980
either hearing it on a different podcast

363
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,060
or finding something on the podcast music network.

364
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,900
Please let me know.

365
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,740
Send me a link.

366
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,060
And there's so many songs now.

367
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,780
In fact, we've had, what is now 20,000 over 20,000 songs

368
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,860
reported played?

369
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,060
Today, I mean, those are phenomenal numbers.

370
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,060
Think about it.

371
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,820
You know, an average of all of those podcasts

372
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,020
and let's say an average of,

373
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,700
call it 500 listeners,

374
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,380
times 20,000, a simple big-ass numbers.

375
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,980
This is a real exposure.

376
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,860
Now, it's gonna be interesting to see what happens

377
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,380
when we activate the sales from a number,

378
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,340
from a number of different perspectives.

379
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,220
The first one being just a people will buy.

380
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,860
I'm pretty sure that people are going to buy music,

381
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,380
but also what's gonna be interesting about it

382
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,300
is that it's no DRM, it's MP3.

383
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,180
So it really comes down to humanity

384
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,900
and people wanting to support artists.

385
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,180
And I believe that the pod safe revolution

386
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,540
is much more about the connection between the artist

387
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,460
and their audience and people are sending

388
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,900
little messages back and forth

389
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,620
when they're buying CDs and artists

390
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,380
or sending personalized notes back.

391
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,980
And people feel very involved.

392
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,540
I believe it's going to work.

393
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,540
Over time, who knows what's gonna happen?

394
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,820
But what if it did work?

395
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,660
What if those 10 million virtual spins resulted

396
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,740
in a million people purchasing a track?

397
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,900
It'll really screw up some other people's business.

398
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,620
You know, I'm talking about it anyway.

399
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,180
Okay, so maybe tomorrow we'll start testing out pieces

400
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,460
of the podcast delivery network.

401
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,340
So if stuff goes a little screwy,

402
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,980
then my apologies in advance,

403
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,100
but please let me know what problems you're seeing

404
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,580
if they do occur in the same token.

405
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,860
Everything could be just pretty smooth

406
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,700
and just work.

407
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,860
In fact, that's what I'm counting on.

408
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,340
We've got all kinds of technology

409
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,340
that's being put in place that can insert audio.

410
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,580
It's gonna be a crazy couple of days

411
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,420
before I head back.

412
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
That's for sure.

413
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,980
All right, you guys have yourself a fantastic day.

414
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,580
I'll be back tomorrow with more stuff to talk about.

415
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,940
We probably some Trinity stuff.

416
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,380
Now see, we can get out to the biofueloasis

417
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,900
before I either run out of diesel

418
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
or I have to go back home.

419
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Stay subscribed.

420
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,340
Pot show.

421
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,180
Tough on dirt, gentle on your ears.
