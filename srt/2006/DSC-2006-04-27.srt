5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,760
You could say this podcast is explicit at times.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,760
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,760
To get through.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,760
I've been making my plans.

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
I've been calling my fans.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
I've played all in my hands.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Cause I really want to.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Crack it out.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
I've come before the rock charts.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
Crack it out.

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
We just didn't know the rock charts.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Crack it out.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Crack it out.

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,760
So I've put the big wings.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Crack it out.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,760
Crack it out.

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
I've been hoping to get out.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
I don't turn out a fraud.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Living for the applause.

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Well, that's a late new.

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
I even changed my name.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
This fucking session for fame.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,760
But my head is the same name.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,760
And it's when I'm mature.

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Crack it out.

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,760
I've never forgotten rock charts.

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Crack it out.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
We just didn't know the rock charts.

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Crack it out.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Crack it out.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
So I've put the big wings.

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Crack it out.

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,760
So I've been making my plans.

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Crack it out.

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
So I've put the big wings.

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Crack it out.

81
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Don't make me the one.

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Crack it out.

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Break it down

84
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,760
Break it down

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Break it down

86
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Break it down

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Break it down

88
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Break it down

89
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Not just pot safe, but

90
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Kind of a pot safe anthem as well

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
Crank it out

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Every shine from Caliph for an I.A.

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
From the pot safe music network

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Music.potshow.com

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
And the irony of course is that

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
That song is completely a

97
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Pop-Tard crank it out too

98
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Which makes me just love it all the more

99
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Her fantastic

100
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Everybody how you doing

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
It's Adam

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
You're your friend

103
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
And your ear buds

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Coming to you from curry cottage

105
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Started out really nice this morning

106
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
We had some sunshine

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
It's kind of gone away

108
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
But temperatures are nice

109
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
And spring is in the air

110
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
If you look at my

111
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
My flicker page

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,760
You can see a couple of pictures that I took

113
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
I think two weeks ago in the back garden

114
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,760
And it's really starting to look very very beautiful

115
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
And what a song that was

116
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
How to get it all rocking and rolling

117
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
So a couple of things I want to talk with you about today

118
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
We should be able to fit in a

119
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
40 minute Charlie for you

120
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Which seems to be the

121
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
The overwhelming requests for the length of show

122
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
You know this guy Tom Scrooting

123
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
He's a Dutch guy

124
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
I think he's

125
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Well it's a Dutch name

126
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
So I presume he's Dutch he

127
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Move to Australia

128
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
You actually I don't really know his background

129
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
I don't even know if I've ever had an audio

130
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Comment from Tom

131
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
But he used to listen to

132
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,760
My radio shows in the early early 80s

133
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I'm talking 83, 84

134
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,760
And I believe he also has lots of air checks

135
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
From my earlier pirate radio work

136
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
In fact he's become kind of a

137
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,760
A collecting point for all of my media stuff

138
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Which I'm really happy about

139
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Everybody should be so lucky to have

140
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Someone to document their stuff

141
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,760
And before we left the castle

142
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
I sent him a huge cardboard box

143
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Just filled with cassette tapes and

144
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
Gosh knows what

145
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
And he knew with the agreement

146
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
That he would digitize it

147
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
And he put it up as a podcast

148
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Which of course I'll put a link to that in the show

149
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
No, it's if you're interested

150
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
It's really if you don't understand

151
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Dots you're not going to like all that much

152
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
But he's also finding all these pictures

153
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,760
And I posted one this morning on curry.com of me with meatloaf

154
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
From about 20 years ago on stage

155
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,760
And the story, the story behind that

156
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Trying to think

157
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,760
I think it was John Farnum at the time

158
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Had a huge hit with your voice

159
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
And he was either

160
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
I don't know if meatloaf produced that record

161
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I think they also they did a song together

162
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,760
And I can't quite remember what it was

163
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
It was like

164
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Man my memory

165
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
And this is not the short term

166
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
We know why that's failing

167
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
But the long term now

168
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I can't remember what the song was

169
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
It wasn't a big hit

170
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
And so they both came to promote the record

171
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
And they came to the studios in the Netherlands

172
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
And I think John Farnum was late

173
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
He was coming in from the

174
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Maybe he was coming in from

175
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Well, not coming in on the same plane as

176
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
As meat as we call him in the biz meat

177
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,760
And so they had to practice their song

178
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
You know, do a camera rehearsal

179
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
And that's what you're seeing there

180
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
As me on stage

181
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Pretending to be John Farnum

182
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
And it was I had to say

183
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
It was really cool to do

184
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
I've done that a couple times

185
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
With some pretty big artists just stood in

186
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
And sometimes I was actually broadcast

187
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
That actual take

188
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Anyway, so Tom came up with this great picture

189
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Of one of my very first cars

190
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Which I'm going to put a link on the show notes

191
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
As well

192
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
It's Aloncia

193
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
And

194
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
And he said, you know, you would promise

195
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
I can't remember when

196
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
But apparently I'd promise to tell the story behind the car

197
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Well now that you see the car

198
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
It was I bought it off the car

199
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Dealer just down the road

200
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Bruno who later was incarcerated in the UK

201
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Because he welded like 50 kilos of cocaine

202
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Into the gas tank of a Jaguar e-type

203
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Was trying to import

204
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,760
So this guy was right on the up and up

205
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Right, what'd you expect from a second and car dealer

206
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,760
And so I needed new front tires

207
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
And he got me two new tires

208
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
At a cheap price

209
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
I had no money at the time

210
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
I was just starting out on the in my TV show

211
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
And it was almost like in a test period

212
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
So they were giving me very little

213
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Very little money

214
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
So I had to get the cheap tires

215
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
And then I was driving to the studio

216
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
The next day

217
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
And this was all still very, very exciting

218
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
For me, I can't believe I'm actually driving to the studio

219
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,760
And I'm driving on for those of you who live in the Netherlands

220
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Fraylons of Ech, which connects the highway

221
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Between Amsterdam and Utrecht and Hilversum

222
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
You can kind of take a short cut

223
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Which is I'd say

224
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
It's kind of like that road that all the stars

225
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,760
And Hollywood take to get to the valley to the studio

226
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
So that's kind of this type of road

227
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
So lots of celebrities take it in the morning

228
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
And I'm driving along

229
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
And man, I'm like man, there's a lot of shimmy in the wheel

230
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,760
And the shimmy seems to get progressively worse

231
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
And just as I'm coming into Hilversum

232
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Just into the intersection

233
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Both wheels completely, front wheels completely fall off

234
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Axel's breaking

235
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Not some bolts flying all over the place

236
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Meanwhile, I'm about three minutes away from being late

237
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
So I literally just ditched the car

238
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Run to the studio

239
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Because I was definitely afraid I was going to get in trouble

240
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,760
And then sometime near the end of the afternoon

241
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
The cops came into the studio

242
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,760
And there was a BB gun, a BB hand gun

243
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Which of course was Bruno's

244
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
And it was in the back seat

245
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Or underneath the back seat

246
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
And so they took you in for questioning

247
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
And this is like my second or third week of work

248
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
This is my get to work car

249
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Needless to say

250
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
I was able to explain everything

251
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,760
And maybe that's why they got Bruno a year or two later

252
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,760
But it'd be cool to hear your first car story

253
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
If you have one, if you have any interesting car stories

254
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Because sometimes they can be fun and pretty personal

255
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
And this really only works if you

256
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,760
If you look at the

257
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
If you look at the picture

258
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
So check that out on curry.com

259
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
I'll put a link to it

260
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
I'll put it up on the flicker page

261
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
There you go

262
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Chris Murray says Adam in

263
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
DSC-37

264
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
You played a sample of the radio stations

265
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Available to you as you drove to Farrow

266
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Because that's right on the flying sound scene

267
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
I was surprised that you only played FM stations

268
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Really?

269
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Do you not have a DAB radio in that fancy car of yours?

270
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Yeah, well no, I don't

271
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
That's the digital audio broadcast standard

272
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Which I presume all stations across Europe

273
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Have to switch over to that initially

274
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,760
And that really is what's going on

275
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
In the automotive industry

276
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
When it comes to radio

277
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Look at the states we have serious and XM

278
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Bating it out for each other

279
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Clearly serious on the winning hand

280
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,760
And in Europe we've got DAB

281
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
So if you actually, well you can't take your car from Europe

282
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
To the US doesn't make them much difference

283
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
But look at all these incompatible standards

284
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Even though I know DAB will happen in the states as well

285
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,760
But that was, these were upgrades that were planned 20 years ago

286
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,760
In conjunction with the automobile industry

287
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
This stuff was done on purpose

288
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Because that's the distribution outlet

289
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
And boy, what a disruptive technology

290
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
MP3 became, huh?

291
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Because all of a sudden we're just burning CDs

292
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Which everybody has, we're, we've got earbuds in

293
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,760
You know, if the folks from Omni Outliner Pro

294
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Or listening, I use your Omni Outliner

295
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
All the time from my show prep

296
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
And I really, really love it

297
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
But something happened with a recent upgrade

298
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Which I don't understand

299
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,760
When I, when I save an outline that has MP3s in it

300
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Or even if I export it

301
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
About half of the MP3s

302
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
And I can't quite figure out why

303
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Which ones do it for what reason

304
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Convert to quick time movies

305
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
So they actually have the dot MP3 extension

306
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Then they get a dot MOV extension

307
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,760
And then they won't open unless you manually remove that extension

308
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,760
And it probably adds seven or seven to ten minutes of prep time

309
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
It's pretty annoying

310
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,760
If you could figure that out for me, I'd really appreciate it

311
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,760
And I've been on the network for a couple of weeks now

312
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,760
But I want to introduce you to these two women

313
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Personally

314
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Well, maybe not personally

315
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
They'll do it personally

316
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
We interrupt Adam Curry's Daily Source Code

317
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
For this important montage

And I'm Karla

324
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Welcome to Rumor Pearls

325
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
We're two sisters

326
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Woohoo

327
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Both of them all

328
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Here, Ben

329
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
And it's now

330
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
No community service going on there

331
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I'll tell you that much

334
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
I've gone MTV, I believe

335
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,760
It's a video I've had

336
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
But to Karla, that is a diamond ring

337
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Essential

338
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Nothing like cheap wine

339
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Look at the freaking size of this ad

340
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
When they become rich and famous

341
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Which we will

342
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
$2.99

343
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
$2.99

344
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm a graphic designer

345
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm not a graphic designer

346
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
They're cute

347
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
They're pretty cute

348
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
I actually check in the bottom

349
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
I'm like

350
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Oh Jesus

351
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
But anyway

352
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
You're getting that

353
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Well, you know what?

354
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
One little thing, the one thing I was thinking

355
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm younger boys

356
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Is you can train that

357
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
You can train that

358
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
That's the good thing

359
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
There were already following

360
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
I know

361
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
They are trainable

362
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
They're trainable

363
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
We'll take that

364
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
We'll take that

365
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
We'll take that

366
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
We'll take that

367
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
We'll take that

368
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
We'll take that

369
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
We'll take that

370
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
We'll take that

371
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
We'll take that

372
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
We'll take that

373
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
We'll take that

374
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
We'll take that

375

We'll take that

392
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Girls want to hang out with us

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
And guys want a data

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
We're a part of a pod family

406
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760

Oh stop teasing

410
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Just stop teasing William

411
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
I gotta get a Patricia up here

412
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
I gotta get on the show today

413
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Hey Adam, this is Matt

414
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Alfred Matt's basement workshop

415
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Hey, just want to let you know that you and your listeners are welcome to come down to the shop

416
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
And check out what I'm doing

417
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
I got a little podcast

418
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
All about woodworking

419
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Both the amateur's perspective on it

420
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
So we're talking about

421
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
We've been talking about tools

422
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
And we're going to start getting some design

423
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
And furniture building and everything

424
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
It's another one of those hobby podcasts

425
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
It makes me a hobbycaster

426
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
I'm not sure, I gotta work on that name anyways

427
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
But you and the listeners are more than welcome to come on over

428
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
You can check me out at iTunes

429
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
You can check me out at podcast alley

430
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Hey, just come on over to Matt's basementworkshop.com

431
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,760
And you can check out the show notes and the links and everything

432
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
And what did you just come on down in?

433
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
The door's always open

434
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
And as I ask you say, maybe you'll put on a little ear protection

435
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
And put on some safety glasses

436
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Alright, I'll be looking forward to hearing from you

437
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
And take care everybody

438
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Straight grains and sharp blades, buddy

439
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
I think I played that one already

440
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Didn't I? Straight grains and sharp blades

441
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
If not, I really like it

442
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Nothing like a bit of wood after the rumor girls

443
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
You know, I got to

444
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,760
I really wanted to ask Patricia what she thought of her short stay at

445
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
The draft and darts

446
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Hold on a second, you know what I'll call her

447
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
That's what I'll do

448
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Because she was there for about half an hour, 45 minutes

449
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
See if we can get her on the line

450
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Hold on a second, I'll put her on a speaker

451
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
So you guys can hear too

452
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
You can probably already hear

453
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Yes, she's in Britain

454
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
I can tell by the ring

455
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
We're locating

456
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
I can hear the phone ringing last

457
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,760
It's probably right next door

458
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Oh man, this is this is lame

459
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Hold on a second

460
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
I think her phone is upstairs

461
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Hold on

462
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
Let me call the home line

463
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,760
They usually does it

464
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
I wish they could make blackberries not do that

465
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
That'd be so much cooler

466
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Okay, you can actually hear the phone

467
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Hey baby

468
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Hey listen, I'm in the middle of the show

469
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
When I wanted to ask you about the

470
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
About the meetup we did at the bricklayers arms

471
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Can you come and talk about it

472
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
The meeting?

473
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Yeah, with the podcasters

474
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
In the spot where we were

475
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Yeah, exactly in London

476
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Okay baby, thanks

477
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Okay

478
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
In the meantime, well Patricia's coming up

479
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
We go over to the listener line

480
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Which opened up yesterday

481
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
If you're, we have two numbers one in the states

482
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
201

483
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
65 65 657

484
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Or in the UK

485
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
020

486
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
768137

487
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
53

488
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
Hi Adam

489
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
It's Neil Ford

490
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Just a quick voice message

491
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,760
To say a lot of the phone number idea

492
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Really cool

493
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Meet back and leave

494
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Audio comments

495
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
While catching up with the DSC in the car

496
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Actually brilliant

497
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Great to meet you all

498
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Sunday

499
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
And thank you to Ron

500
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
You and Chris

501
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Thank you Timack

502
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
It's a British podcast interview

503
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
That was really cool

504
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Thank you

505
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
And one last thing

506
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
It was Paul Nichols

507
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I've cast Paul's

508
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah

509
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Thank you once again

510
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Which headphones

511
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
You know, keep producing the DSC

512
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
As many times and as long as you like

513
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Yeah, great, cool

514
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
And I love the numbers

515
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Thank you

516
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Bye

517
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Because I wasn't 100% sure all of a sudden

518
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
It's just the paranoid set scene

519
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Hey babe

520
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Hey Adam, that's a taxi elevator

521
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Oh yes

522
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
The glass elevator

523
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Did you see any golden tickets laying around?

524
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
No

525
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Because we're going to hand more out today

526
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Oh, is that?

527
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Yeah, we're going to do another developer cast

528
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
I was going to do it yesterday

529
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
But Aaron, you know, Aaron O'Neill

530
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Who's the database

531
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Yeah, Australia

532
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,760
She's off on a course at a

533
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
SQL course or something

534
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
She keeps emailing me saying that

535
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
There's a whole bunch of nerd guys there

536
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
And it's horrible

537
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Yeah, I was just having lunch

538
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Not that the listeners care

539
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
No, because they won't see it

540
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
I was in the middle of my lovely lunch

541
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Hey, I got this

542
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
So I have this phone line now

543
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
So people can call in

544
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
I have a new jersey number

545
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Which I thought will be nice and new jersey number

546
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Listen, it's a great number

547
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,760
2016256357

548
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
It's a nice number, isn't it?

549
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Nice numbers

550
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
And I sound nice

551
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
And have a UK number

552
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,760
O2076813753

553
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
I don't like that number

554
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
No

555
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Thank you for agreeing

556
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Listen to this

557
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Listen to this for a second

558
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Hello, Adam

559
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Roger, yeah

560
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Actually, I don't mean it's not

561
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
He's pulled but that's my impression of Roger

562
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Oh, good to do

563
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Anyway, good to make you do the day Adam

564
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
And

565
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
But it's actually

566
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Don't say it's normal

567
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
It's nice and 18 Patricia

568
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Because she had a bit more time

569
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
And I just love Patricia

570
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
I think she's brilliant

571
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
I spent a couple of minutes just having a really good chat with her

572
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
And whatever

573
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
There we go

574
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Now it's sunny, isn't it?

575
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
How do people turn out?

576
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
You turned out to be a longer and thinner

577
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I thought she was probably turned out

578
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
To her and probably wider than you thought

579
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Well, but there we are

580
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Are you talking on the show

581
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
About a couple of things

582
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
First of all, the DSL days is sweet cowboy

583
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
But off my drum kit

584
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
And

585
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Yeah, definitely

586
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Well, yes, the American

587
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
British

588
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Not because I thought you would say that

589
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
You know, you can basically think

590
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
What I said yesterday

591
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Mm-hmm

592
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Is that

593
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
I noticed that while I was in London

594
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
That when you're in American

595
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
It British women just

596
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
I don't know maybe I was reading it wrong

597
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
But it's like they start flirting with you immediately

598
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Really?

599
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,760
And I was saying maybe the other way around as well

600
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
The Americans were just rolling your head

601
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
This

602
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Don't pop the balloon yet

603
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Oh, yeah

604
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Yeah, yeah

605
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Okay, baby

606
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Men are so stupid

607
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Oh, thanks

608
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
Let's listen to what Paul has to say all that

609
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,760
It's funny, and I absolutely look at any of the

610
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Costs of the states

611
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,760
I like how warm the American's flow cover

612
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Lots and lots of American friends

613
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
A lot of business owners

614
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Maybe Paul was getting horny

615
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
I don't know

616
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
There we go

617
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
There we go

618
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
I'll tell you what the British actions

619
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
I think when the states definitely

620
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
The Americans are doors

621
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,760
I represented American ideation

622
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Two in company

623
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
They're usually a bit

624
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Some very big business with

625
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
The sagas

626
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
So you'll have something in London

627
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
But more than not there is in Louis

628
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Allure in Indiana

629
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
And that was good fun

630
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
But now I've really particularly enjoyed the hospitality

631
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
I think the American hospitality

632
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
And

633
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Do you think that's different

634
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,760
The American hospitality from British hospitality?

635
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Yeah

636
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Mm-hmm

637
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Well, American hospitality is like

638
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
Take them on over

639
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Let's have a party

640
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
The approach is more in your face

641
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Yeah

642
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
And I think because of that

643
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
You believe it

644
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,760
But it sounds true

645
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Now they always give you

646
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Such a feeling of success

647
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
And oh you can do it

648
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
How interesting

649
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Yes

650
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
That's it

651
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
You always feel good

652
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Good for me

653
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Wonderful

654
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Exactly

655
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
But they really know

656
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,760
How great how you will make it

657
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
You know

658
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
How about the Brits though

659
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
I remember Eve on and I had once

660
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
A

661
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,760
An appointment in one of the hotels in London

662
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
When we used to live in Holland

663
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Yeah

664
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
And it was from a records company

665
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
And it was with the Star Sisters

666
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
And so we had the guy

667
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
The guy was over there

668
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
We had to meet in somewhere

669
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
I said we were waiting for him

670
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
And it took a while

671
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
But then finally he came

672
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
With a very big mouth

673
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Hi girls

674
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
It's so good to see you

675
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
And remember the above

676
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
I was in America

677
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
And I know that yeah

678
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
I was in America

679
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
And I know there was something

680
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
And we had to wait

681
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
And he had a sort of remark

682
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Like

683
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Oh

684
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Doesn't matter

685
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Because you're going to be rich

686
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
And you're going to be famous

687
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Anyway

688
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
That was his, you know, right away

689
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Right

690
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
And it gave us a very

691
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
It made you feel good

692
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
You feel good

693
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
But judging from the royalty statements

694
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Judging from the royalty statements in the UK

695
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
He didn't do such a good job

696
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
No nothing happened

697
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
But you know that moment

698
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
We look at each other

699
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Oh that sounds good

700
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
You know

701
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
So how about the bridge

702
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
It makes you feel good

703
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Well the bridge of our very

704
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
The bridge of our very

705
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Almost

706
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
And they, I think they wouldn't

707
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Exet your raid

708
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
No

709
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Redden

710
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
You know they would

711
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Take it back a little bit

712
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
And you know what I mean?

713
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Hold back a bit

714
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
And hold back a bit

715
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
And not to exaggerate

716
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
It's more the truth

717
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
I guess

718
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
I hope so

719
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Well

720
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
We don't have a lot of people

721
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
It came over actually

722
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Mary

723
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
But very nice

724
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Very talkative

725
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
And very

726
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Absolutely

727
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Yeah

728
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
And you know

729
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
We had dinner right away

730
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
With our neighbors

731
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Straight very

732
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
But I was not

733
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
And we'll not flirt with Mary

734
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
You always flirt with everybody

735
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
But anyway

736
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
I had a great time

737
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Meeting the guys

738
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Yeah

739
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Yeah

740
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Well let's listen to the rest of Paul's

741
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Comment then I want to ask you about that

742
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
He's far, far, back to probably

743
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
But she's saying that

744
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
She should be warm

745
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Service

746
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
But when he got so restaurant

747
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Or something particular

748
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I'm sure you've noticed this

749
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
The service over here

750
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
That's true

751
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Girl

752
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Yeah

753
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Absolutely

754
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
We were at the Ivy

755
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Which is supposed to be the bomb

756
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Digity restaurant

757
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
It took forever

758
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
To get our food

759
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
And the lobster that you had

760
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
I was raw

761
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Oh

762
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
One half of it was raw

763
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
And you told the waiter

764
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
And then he was like

765
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Oh, that's a bummer

766
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
No, I said to him

767
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
You said you're done

768
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
I said no

769
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
And I didn't like it

770
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
And he said, oh

771
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I'm sorry

772
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
And that was it

773
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
That was it

774
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
It's right

775
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
I'm sorry to hear that

776
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Yeah

777
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
And that was it

778
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Okay

779
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
But it's true

780
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
It's true

781
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Because in America

782
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
If you order something

783
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
If you order your food

784
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
It needs to be good

785
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
It needs to be exactly the way you want it

786
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
You can tell them

787
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
You know the way you want it

788
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Nobody will say anything

789
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Because Americans

790
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
100%

791
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Quality

792
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Quality

793
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Folks listening to a

794
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760

795
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
If you want to hear more of

796
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
The lovely lady Patricia

797
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
They'll have to download the rest of the show

798
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
A daily source code dot com

799
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
And of course

800
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
We'll meet again tomorrow

801
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Same time on 102

802
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
On Serious for the Friday festivities

803
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Lady Patricia

804
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Children at her feed

805
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
On 101

806
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
How you make ends meet

807
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Who pays the money

808
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Now who has the money

809
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
When you need the rent

810
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,760
I don't

811
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
I don't

812
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm so bad at that

813
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
I don't

814
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
I don't not very good at the lady

815
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
I never liked that song

816
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
I haven't

817
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
I haven't

818
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Didn't have a couple of Beatles songs

819
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
And you're coming out again

820
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
They're going to remaster them

821
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
And you'll be able to buy them digitally

822
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Yeah

823
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
For the 20th time of

824
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Bought the Beatles

825
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Records

826
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
At the month

827
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
cassette tapes on albums

828
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
On CDs

829
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Frank Frank Sinatra

830
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
Son was in the city

831
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
What's his name?

832
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Frank Junior

833
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Frank Junior

834
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Frank Sinatra

835
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
How cool is that?

836
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Yeah

837
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
My name is Frank Sinatra

838
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
How do you look?

839
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
How do you look?

840
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
How do you look?

841
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
He doesn't have the looks of his day

842
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
And who is his mom?

843
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Yeah

844
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
That's a good question

845
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
And the first is

846
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Nancy

847
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Nancy with laughing face

848
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
What is Nancy's daughter?

849
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
No, Nancy is also his daughter

850
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
But it's the old Nancy

851
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
And the song was about his wife

852
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
I guess

853
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,760
So he's son was in town

854
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
And he promoted a little bit of the show

855
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
That's going on in that

856
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Patricia by the way

857
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
It's completely all over mainstream media

858
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
She keeps me up to speed

859
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
And what's going on?

860
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Who's shagging who?

861
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
If I knew that

862
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
I would have known a little bit more about it

863
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
But anyway

864
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
So to show Frank Sinatra is in town

865
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Which is absolutely great

866
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Great reviews

867
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
The theater production

868
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Yeah

869
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
The theater production

870
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,760
And he said that the orchestra is great

871
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Wonderful ballet

872
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
And he said

873
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
And then the guy from the news

874
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Said the anchor man said

875
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Do you think most more artists could do that

876
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Like your dad

877
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Be like Frank Sinatra

878
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
Be like Frank Sinatra

879
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Have a show like this

880
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
And he said you know what?

881
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
The Beatles you'd have that

882
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
The Beatles you'd do

883
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Isn't it a great idea

884
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Well, they're what?

885
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Remember there was Beatles mania

886
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
Don't you remember?

887
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
No, not like that

888
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
I mean with real footage

889
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Oh, okay

890
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
And now with the songs and a band

891
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
And then and every

892
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
That would be great

893
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
I would go

894
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
Yeah

895
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Hey, we're going to see Joan Collins

896
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
I got the tickets

897
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Oh, yeah, that's right

898
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
She has a one woman show

899
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
In evening

900
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
And evening with Joe

901
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
But Joe

902
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Yeah, we just think it's amazing that she can still stand on her legs

903
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
That's not true

904
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
You think that

905
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Let me finish up this bit with Paul

906
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
I want to talk to you about the podcast

907
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Back in the side back in the side

908
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
So over in the states

909
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
It really is very, very good

910
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Anyway

911
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
That's my

912
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Sorry, I'm sort of like an idiot here

913
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Yeah

914
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
I'm sort of like a horrible talking

915
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
So I'm about finally

916
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
I'm sort of an idiot

917
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
And that's more

918
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Daly and spit than my boss

919
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
And you're on to sign

920
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Hi, everything's okay

921
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Yeah, all the way best

922
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Right now

923
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
All right, thank you

924
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
So

925
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Yeah, I'm my team, yeah

926
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
So you came to the podcast

927
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
There's a draft and darts

928
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Yeah, yeah

929
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
What'd you think?

930
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
It was a fantastic

931
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
What were you expecting?

932
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
It's that I had to leave

933
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Because it was getting too crowded

934
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
And too smoky for you

935
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
And too smoky for you

936
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
That's not very good for my little heart

937
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
But

938
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
You have a big heart

939
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
It's so huge

940
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
I can see it pounding

941
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Through your chest right now

942
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
I know

943
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
But it's not that healthy

944
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
So I see you stand

945
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Looking at your chest

946
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
In a pub

947
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Ah

948
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
But it was very nice

949
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
The guys were so nice

950
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
Yeah, we had a nice chat

951
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
What'd you talk about?

952
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
And well, the funniest thing that I came in

953
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
And I didn't expect to actually

954
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
What happened

955
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Was high pressures are nice to meet you

956
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
And remember you said this

957
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
He said that and was so cool

958
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
When you said this

959
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
And I thought

960
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Oh my god

961
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Well, people listen

962
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
These are what I've been telling you

963
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Yeah

964
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Yeah

965
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,760
You know, because we are having a normal conversation

966
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
And you know what?

967
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
And I have no idea

968
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
To say I really enjoy talking to you like this

969
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
We should maybe we just have headphones and microphones

970
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Wherever we sit

971
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
So we just talk like this

972
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
You open up more

973
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Well, you have a mic in front of you

974
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Maybe it's

975
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Maybe it's not just a mic that makes me open up

976
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Maybe it's anything that's long and hard

977
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Oh

978
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Oh

979
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Oh, you got to hear this from Angie

980
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Hold on a second

981
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Listen to this

982
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Hey Adam

983
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
I know I'm not actually a listener

984
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
But I couldn't resist trying out the feedback

985
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
So mine pretty cool

986
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Yeah

987
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
So you should have share a lot on Friday

988
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
The one thing that's really stuck in my mind

989
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Is this energy

990
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Because you should have a strap on

991
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Yeah

992
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Anyways

993
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Talk to you later

994
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Didn't know me stuck in your mind

995
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Yeah

996
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
My good seed you shouldn't say those things

997
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
What's going to happen?

998
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
They're going to beat me up

999
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Yeah

1000
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,760
He doesn't

1001
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Sometimes I tell you

1002
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
Yeah, you don't like that one

1003
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Don't say those things

1004
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Yeah

1005
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Ever since I started web-logging Patricia

1006
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
And I have had an ongoing

1007
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Let's call it conversation

1008
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
About the things that I talk about

1009
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Oh, I argue yeah

1010
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
No, well

1011
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Well, I don't agree

1012
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
I don't agree

1013
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
I

1014
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
I

1015
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Understand you will

1016
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
You know you're telling things

1017
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
And you're writing them down

1018
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
It's what people want to hear

1019
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
It's what people want to hear

1020
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
You're very good in writing it down

1021
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Oh, then

1022
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I'm not good in writing it

1023
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Oh, I'm not good in writing it

1024
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
No

1025
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Maybe more when you're writing it down

1026
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Well, maybe it's better

1027
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
I don't write it down then

1028
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
And

1029
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
And sometimes I don't like it

1030
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Because I think it's too private

1031
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
And I meet people

1032
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,760
And you know, they tell me a sort of a whole story

1033
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
About my private

1034
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Oh, but like

1035
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
That's well, first of all

1036
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Would you rather have people

1037
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
And magazines make it up

1038
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
All the time

1039
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Or would you rather that people have an opportunity

1040
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
To hear what you're really like

1041
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Yeah, but they might just

1042
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,260
That's just a exaggerated

1043
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,760
And make this a whole

1044
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
iE hamburger

1045
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Who might exaggerate

1046
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Who might exaggerate

1047
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,800
Who might exaggerate

1048
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,760
Who might exaggerate

1049
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,800
Who might exaggerate

1050
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,760
All the cosUM's

1051
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Oh that c falagher

1052
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
There are things that I don't

1053
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
People wanna know

1054
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Who?

1055
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
It's a about me

1056
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
I'm saying things about me

1057
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Not about you

1058
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Yeah, hello

1059
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
I'm married to you

1060
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Yeah

1061
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
You know

1062
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
So

1063
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
But I'm not ashamed

1064
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Of me

1065
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
No, I know that but I am

1066
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,760
I'm a lady.

1067
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,980
She's a lady.

1068
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,160
I'm a lady.

1069
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,040
You know there are things.

1070
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,560
And you know I am honest.

1071
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
I say a lot.

1072
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,240
And you say lady things.

1073
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,680
I input you know, I'm still a lady.

1074
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,920
A lady.

1075
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,180
I love that.

1076
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,440
It's Linda.

1077
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
Hello.

1078
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,680
There's another.

1079
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,780
Another.

1080
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,380
That's not an.

1081
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,220
Not just a fly.

1082
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
No.

1083
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,020
Hello.

1084
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,860
That's not a fly.

1085
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:36,000
you have some insurance for you. Computer says no. Computer says no. Yeah. It's so

1086
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,700
horrible, but don't we like it? It's on in the States. Little Britain. You've got to

1087
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,340
watch that. If you look for it. I think they're shocked. I wonder if they broadcast

1088
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,580
all of it because sometimes there's stuff in there that I'm like how that could

1089
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,300
well maybe you could make on basically I guess. And they probably think that those

1090
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:57,720
English people are nuts. That's right. I have to go there. That's what they're

1091
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,340
probably said. I have to go there. You know, I have to go see the theater. Meanwhile

1092
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,060
they're thinking man there's some horny shit going over there and then you came

1093
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,340
now we got to go to Britain. Get us some boaty and Britain. Yeah. Right. All right baby.

1094
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,260
Well thank you so much for her. So yes it was fun. I had fun in the past. My people huh?

1095
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,620
Yeah. Yeah. Lots of people were there. Yeah. When you were going I think there was like

1096
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,980
50. I know. I heard that. It was quite a mess. I missed a lot. And I have to say good

1097
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:31,500
looking guys. Yeah. Yeah. Think so. Yeah. Real man. There were a couple of ladies that

1098
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:40,340
ladies there too. Yeah. Just a couple. Yeah. Okay babe. And nice ladies. Exactly. Anything else?

1099
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:46,100
No. You want a cup of soup? Oh. Your homemade soup? Is this the vegetable soup with ginger?

1100
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:52,660
Yes. It's very good for your body. Yes. Well why don't you give me 20 minutes of

1101
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,140
finish the show and then I'll come downstairs. Okay. And you can give it to me. All right.

1102
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,780
What? The soup. Oh. Okay. Okay. Come on. It's your mind out of the gutter woman.

1103
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,100
Bye bye. Okay. Bye bye. Thank you, honey. Just hang it up on the mic. Yeah. It's

1104
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,460
not a good sound. What's not? You're sound that that's just the headphones. The sound

1105
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,700
is great. Believe me. It sounds great. I'll play it for you later. All right. But I don't have

1106
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,980
a good sound. You have a great sound. Just not in those headphones. That's what I mean.

1107
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:30,420
Oh, I say hello Adam. It's Lord Colo podcast here. Regarding your discussion on

1108
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,540
British and American accents and effects, they might have on the opposite sex on your

1109
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,140
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-7-4. Well, yes, I too find that my marvelous

1110
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,380
British accents makes ladies turn to jelly and throw themselves at my feet whenever I'm

1111
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,100
in the United States of America. Not that I would take any notice at all, of course. What

1112
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,060
would mean being happily hooked and bound to the wonderful Doctor Joe? Who I believe had a

1113
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,460
rather splendid chin leg with yourself in London at the weekend? I understand that the

1114
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,740
touch he had with you in her stupidestly sexy British accents involved the virtual

1115
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:10,820
world of second life and donations of virtual marital appendages to Americans might call

1116
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:18,260
a cock. Anyway, standardly titillating dialogue, I'm sure. We've been playing around a bit

1117
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,460
in second life. We've even spent New Year's Eve at a wonderful party thrown by Sir Eric Rice

1118
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,260
who has been doing some interesting audio and video podcast. I've over at Slack Street.

1119
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,860
Go and check an album, look for spin-math in it's really rather splendid. Anyway, I was wondering

1120
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:39,060
if you might pop a link on your blog side menu which links to your carpool in second life

1121
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:45,540
and tell us what your second life name is. That would be wonderful. And finally, I was also wondering

1122
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,060
when someone in second life does something really, really bad, did they go on to life row?

1123
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,540
And after people died. Unfortunately, cut off there. He was on a roll too.

1124
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,580
Yeah. And I definitely want to do that. I definitely want to put a link to the curry castle

1125
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,660
because you can do that with second life. You can link to it from with a web link and it'll

1126
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,500
open up second life and it'll take you right there. I'm just not quite done building. In fact,

1127
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:19,940
I'm really not done yet. But listen, what happened yesterday? So, excuse me. So, what I like so

1128
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,380
much about second life is you can yeah, you can build all this stuff. But they've got a whole

1129
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,740
money flow and I'd like it so much because I can just spend money and buy whatever I want and then

1130
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,500
I can adapt it. You know, that's a great way to learn just to buy stuff off the shelf and then

1131
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,820
mess with the scripts and mess with the textures and the stretching and resizing and rotating

1132
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,620
and customizing it all. And all of a sudden yesterday, as I'm about to purchase, what was I buying?

1133
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:51,460
I think a waterfall. I get this message that if you're younger than 45 days old on second life,

1134
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:58,020
you have a credit card limit, which is $150 US. So, I don't know how many second life

1135
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,980
linden dollars that is, but you can tell I've spent quite a bit of money. But you know, land and

1136
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,940
shit is expensive. And that castle, what do you think that sent me back? So, I'm like, well, wait a minute,

1137
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:14,820
I'm looking all over the site and there's no way to buy more money until you're 45 days old.

1138
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,940
And this is like, I can't believe this. Is this this is make it really a game? I mean, now I have

1139
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,740
to go off and I have to figure out a different way of making money until I can cash some in.

1140
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,860
I mean, this is not easy for guys for girls. Yeah, I mean, girls all over second life

1141
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,740
make money by dancing in their escort services and in those all kinds of ways. And, you know,

1142
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,140
that's really how it works. Guys coming with a credit card, they make chicks dance and I call them

1143
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,860
chicks because that's what they are in these avatars that nothing more than chicks.

1144
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:52,740
Some of them are escorts. You pay him for sex. And I'm reliably informed. And, you know,

1145
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,260
that's how the money flows through the whole system. They go out and shop and buy shoes and

1146
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,820
bling and all kinds of trinkets. It really, it really is art replicating life in this case.

1147
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,260
And, you know, I think it's going to be a hell of a lot harder for a guy. I mean,

1148
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,980
I'm sure that I could sex up my avatar and I could make some money in the blue boy club,

1149
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:16,260
but not exactly my idea of fun, if you know what I mean. So, I sent off a message to second

1150
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,060
life and I said, help. I want to spend more money. Can I please spend more money with your service?

1151
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:28,900
Anyway, yesterday met a couple more people online. If you saw that Google video that I posted

1152
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,140
a link to yesterday, this actually, I was surprised there's only five and a half thousand

1153
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:39,300
concurrent connections at any one time, which doesn't seem like a lot, particularly for the amount of

1154
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,580
horse horsepower they have to put behind this system to be able to render that, you know,

1155
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,100
all of that stuff, only five and a half thousand streams. I make an only magic if this thing really

1156
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,060
hits the big time. What is going to take to make that work and there's sometimes this horrible

1157
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,180
lag that occurs and, you know, it really starts to harsh your mellow, particularly if you're building

1158
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:06,180
something. But I met Spin Martin. I was out shopping and he was looking for fountain. I think he was

1159
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,620
spitting up his place. For those of you who don't know who Spin Martin is, that's what was just

1160
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:18,260
mentioned that audio comment by Paul. That's Eric Rice. It's funny because in real life, I probably

1161
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:23,620
would have told him to go fuck off after some of the podcast he did about me and Podgeo. But in

1162
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:30,100
second life, we were surprisingly civil to each. I don't know. My brains and overdrive.

1163
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:39,460
Angie B was in yesterday. I was really cool to have Angie in the had her in the castle and

1164
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:45,540
tour to around and it was the most time we spent together in communication ever, probably.

1165
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:51,860
And I apologize for being like, I guess she was offended by something I said about her voice

1166
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:59,220
work. Angie, you know, you're the dulcet tones of Miss Angie B, you're so beautiful and so sexy.

1167
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,620
You know that. Anyway, I apologize. I tried to give her a beautiful dress. That's what I've been

1168
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:10,260
spending on my money on. But I purchased the dress and then I couldn't give it to her. The only thing

1169
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:15,700
I can do with this dress is wearing myself. Ah, wait a minute. Maybe that's how I can make some money.

1170
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:24,100
Enjoy all kinds of music. Then lend me your ear. Here at the Ed's Mix Bad Podcast,

today, simply point your browser to Ed's Mix Bad.com. Music has always been part of your life.

1175
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:56,500
Even from the one, it brings out the best in you. It brings out the worst in you.

1176
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,940
Some music can affect your emotions so much. If you're not careful,

1177
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:08,260
you might just get yourself a speeding ticket. Other music may be the tipping point.

1178
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:15,860
That can push you to end life itself. So why not learn all you can from the artists

1179
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:24,500
that affect you so much? That's just what we do here on Podsil Radio. Every show we feature a

1180
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:31,780
single artist from the Podsafe music network. One that is so amazing that they can

1181
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:39,780
call your emotions to explode. My thanks to Adam Curry and the Podsil podcast network

1182
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:49,540
for inviting Podsil Radio into the lineup. Together, there is no emotion that we can't control.

1183
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:58,020
So you there, Podsil Radio.com. Joe and welcome my friend.

1184
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:06,500
YouTube have some dulce at tones. I'm really trying to stick to this 40 minute schedule. I'm

1185
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,100
going to go over again today. But since we had the lovely lady Patricia on the show,

1186
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,940
I'm going to skip the bit I want to talk about, which is fame and privacy. I'll keep that

1187
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,340
for too. I'm going to do that tomorrow as well as I've got some excellent feedback on the silent

1188
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,260
birth, the Scientology Silent Birth Treatment. I'm almost called the Silent Birth Treatment.

1189
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,300
So if you have any if you want to weigh in on that do that today because I'll be talking about

1190
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,220
that tomorrow on the Friday edition of the Charlie and I would really love some jam and songs.

1191
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,220
I love the fact that you keep sending me suggestions just because it didn't get played doesn't

1192
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,220
mean it's not in the queue or I haven't, you know, queued it up for for some other day.

1193
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,260
Just keep the suggestions coming tomorrow. I really want a party that I really want to crank it out.

1194
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,660
One last bit I want to do is from when you know when the Dutch start speaking English,

1195
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:57,300
sometimes it can just be so endearing and this guy is doubly so because he does his show and this

1196
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:06,340
feedback while on his skateboard. So and I'm curious, I just listen to Delhi source calls 372

1197
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:14,820
at least I tried to listen to the last Delhi source go and you know when you're angry

1198
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:24,420
Deep in your heart. You know what to do. Yeah, man. Think again. Deep in your heart. You know what to do.

1199
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:34,180
Well, I'll have you know that I was skating when I was 12 years old. So that's what 29 years ago

1200
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:41,780
28 years ago. No, 29 years ago. Oh, man. And I actually walked around with a little

1201
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,580
tube of graphite my pocket and you know whenever my trucks got kind of jammed up or cruddy.

1202
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,020
Because of course it couldn't you know we couldn't really afford the good stuff and I was living in the

1203
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:57,540
Netherlands so we had kind of shitty boards but so I skateboard footballs like to invite you to our home

1204
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:04,980
base in the Amsterdam Skate Park. Leave your old setup at home. I will hook you up with some new gear.

1205
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,180
You're who? Yeah, we're going to roll a little bit around and bend your finish.

1206
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:19,380
Yeah, all right buddy. I got you. All right one last song for today.

1207
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,060
Here we go. This is traffic from the Alice project on the source code.

1208
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:39,620
What else have you on your daily commute? How many of you have buckled up? Only to find you still

1209
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,340
sitting in a long line of cars. You go in nowhere.

1210
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:52,020
Slow. That's right. Sometimes I can't tell if it's an accident or road worker comes.

1211
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:58,900
I mean I even get to my destination. Hey, I've got some place to be. Why are you in that truck?

1212
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,500
Lookin' down at me. Why don't you keep your eyes on the road?

1213
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,940
I don't even want to get there.

1214
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:23,700
Can't you help me decide which route to take? I'm torn with indecision. I've been sitting here for half a day.

1215
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:31,300
I'm afraid my car is going to overheat. Or is it just me? Is there anyone in the entire universe

1216
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:40,420
that's happy to be stuck here like ants in different colored ants? It'll long line just wait

1217
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,580
to get through the tunnel.

1218
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:20,020
This time. So I've gone half a mile and I've got nine miles to go.

1219
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:30,260
Nine miles to go. And the traffic report is getting me nowhere.

1220
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:46,100
I'm the only one who has to get there. I have no.

1221
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:19,860
I'm the only one who has to get there with my time.

1222
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:27,620
Sitting in the light. Sitting in the light. Sitting in the light.

1223
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:34,980
Sitting in the light. Sitting in the light. Sitting in the light.

1224
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:40,260
Sitting in the light. Sitting in the light.

1225
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:52,740
The Alice project from New York City and the traffic song. Thank you very much to Melinda from

1226
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:58,820
my Maryland podcast to convince the band to sign up for the pod save music network. Really appreciate it.

1227
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:07,620

1228
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,100
The Chris Rockwell on his way back home. Gonna be completing the roll out of the

1229
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,660
purchase. Well, we're ready to go. Basically. We're just waiting for everything to open up.

1230
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:21,860
The developers coming into the pod show plus who have received their access codes. Now I believe

1231
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,220
and the podcast delivery network. They're going to be able to see some of this and see some of

1232
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:33,140
this development and Chris is going to Idaho where he'll be working. He continues to work with

1233
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,620
Potcho, but it's going to be an Idaho. I'm going to miss your fat ass pooping in the office. Dude,

1234
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,180
big time.

if you're in Europe calling the States is probably cheaper. O2O768137553. And tomorrow we're going to
