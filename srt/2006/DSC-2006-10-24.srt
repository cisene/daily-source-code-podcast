1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Like, Cmon Scoop, it's DSC 44.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Right?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Right, I'm worried.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He he he.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
With $16 million worth of airplane straps to my ass.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, I'm testing his bedroom curry.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Show myself to my heart and swallow your heart.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To know what makes it easier to stay.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Can I hold your heart and my hand?

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let me never walk onto me.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And my love for I'll tell you.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I love you.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Trust me.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I love you.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You've fixed your hand.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
To make sure it's right.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I haven't lost.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It hurts so much.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It hurts so much.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It hurts so much.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It hurts so much.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Can I hold your heart and my hand?

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Maybe never walk onto me.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But it's so hard to believe.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can I hold your heart and my hand?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Maybe never walk onto me.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But it's so hard to believe.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But it's so hard to believe.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's what I'm talking about.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I think it's what I'm talking about.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Perfect for Nemesis Army.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I love that.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's perfect.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's short, sweet.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's got the power in it.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And it's on the pod safe music network.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can find it at music.podshow.com.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Or in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Nice ending guys.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hey, how you doing everybody?

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It is Tuesday coming to you from Curry Cottage.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It is the daily source code episode 484 crappy day outside.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A lot of stuff going on on the inside.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
As you can tell, no lady Patricia on the show.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I forgot.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I forgot that she's getting a flu shot today.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She gets that every year.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She believes in him.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Of course, I got the flu and she hasn't had it yet.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I've just read.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I was reading in the financial times.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
As I was prepping for the show today.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Haven't my bagel with cream cheese and reading yesterday's newspaper.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You might as well have yesterday's newspaper.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Newspapers are outdated anyway.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think five people have died in Israel from influenza shots.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And it seems that they've all come from the same vaccine pool.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And people have freaking out.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Understandably.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Because you are injecting yourself with the form of the flu virus in the attempt to make you immune for it.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And usually what happens is Patricia will feel shitty for a day as opposed to the ten days that the actual influenza takes.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, we'll track it.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We'll see how it works this year.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I mean, there's different batches on different years.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Exciting stuff in today's show.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've got an old friend of ours stopping by to bring us something that we haven't done in just a little over a year.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But it has been a year since we last heard from him on the show.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So that's coming up in just seconds.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I also want to talk to you about Pete Townsend and stuff we're doing.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Actually, I had a great call today with.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, was his name home?

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I have it here.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Michael, this is last name.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Michael Fuller.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Michael represents aim, which is an organization of independent record labels here in the UK.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And we talked about, you know, what we could do with with their members.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I think they have about 40 or 50,000 tracks that they have up on aim.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And they do have a podcast license.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Although.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
People, I think, are using it.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The uptake hasn't been all that great because it does cost.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think 500 pounds every six months.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So we've been discussing back and forth seeing if we could we could do anything together.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And I must say, I'm bullish on the conversation.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I, you know, they could still only recommend it to their members.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They wouldn't be placing things automatically for a number of reasons.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mostly legal, of course.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But it could get very exciting.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It could really add a whole new slew of great music from fantastic labels to the podcast music.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That works to keep your eye on that.

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And I've got, I've gotten new girlfriends.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There's no doubt about it.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I have girlfriends.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They are from Ireland.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No, no, they're not girlfriends in my beds.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Not BODs.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes, everyone has corrected me.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
On my Irish, Limerick slang.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It sounded like it was BOD, but it's BOD.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You kind of slipped the R in there somewhere.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
BOD.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
My bird.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hi Adam.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hi there.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Daisy and 10.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We're driving around.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Going to the supermarket.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We were listening to your Limerick slang.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well done.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We think you did really well.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But we want to carry it up on one.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a thing.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
As you were saying, your B.A.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She's...

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My B.A.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's not BOD.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's BOD.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's BOD.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
BOD.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
BOD.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
BOD.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's that we have in Dublin.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We call them your moths.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
My moths.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
My moths.

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
My shirt.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
My shirt.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Moth.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We also have terms like Philly.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
My hoth.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or she's a better hoth.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Better hoth.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Of course, Tanya.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Philly.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They're all their terms for women.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is crazy.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If you tried to use any of those words in the United States of America, for your

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
girlfriend or your wife, you would be sliced and diced in a second.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can't call your girl a Philly.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Moth.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I hope you didn't say Moth.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's sure it sounded like you.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We have like B.A.B.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Tanya.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Tanya.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm taking up the Americans' wagons all our time.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Listen to you the whole time, of course.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And we're just walking over to our local supermarket called Super Value.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Super Value.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Jumping us to Super Value.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hey.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You see how well those jingles really do work?

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They knew it.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We're inside the supermarket now.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We are going to look for some splendour.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We're now trying to find a nice sexy assistant to Moth.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You have to assist us in finding it.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's up there with us.

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, he's kind of looking at us to see what the fuck we're doing like.

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Trying to hide you?

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know.

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm trying to hide you.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know.

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Anna, are we now?

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hi.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hi.

178
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They have splendour.

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
They have splendour.

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's good.

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, splendour can be used for all different things.

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So I do a lot of all of them.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm baked in biscuits.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And it does the taste just as good as sugar.

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's go, so.

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know where to the cashews.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh.

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I see some cute ones.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We just use our charm and get past them all.

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Come on.

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Here we go.

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hi.

199
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you.

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm fine.

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Really?

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thanks.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Here we go.

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mission accomplished.

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's it.

206
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Bye, Adam.

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, my fillies from Ireland.

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you so much.

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I was expecting you to run past the cashier.

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So if you could steal the splendour.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But this is amazing.

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So splendour is available in Ireland.

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I haven't been able to find it here.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If anyone has found it, you can't please let me know because lots of experiments

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'd like to do at home.

216
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'd like to have Patricia try it out.

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you.

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Thank you.

219
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
My fillies from Ireland.

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll call you that.

221
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Those of you listening to this particular program on serious satellite stars channel 102,

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
which is one over from the Howard Stern channels.

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You will not be hearing the pod show on serious for the rest of the week after today.

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Due to some preemptive programming.

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Which means we got fucking bumped.

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let me see.

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So tomorrow Wednesday's 6 p.m. Eastern is when normally the pod show on serious kicks off.

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It'll be Dave Marsh with Bruce Springstein, which I'll gladly step aside for the boss any day.

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Not a problem.

230
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then Thursday, Candace Bushnell with Judith Regan.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Not quite sure what the show was about or why we're being preempted for that.

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But I know the names.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They belong on the stars channel.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's for sure.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then on Friday.

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And this is an interesting one.

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The 2006 California governors and first ladies conference on women to the carrying that live.

238
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And if you're wondering, well, why does that happen?

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You know, the satellite technology, although incredibly cool, there's only so many channels

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that the serious can actually create out of the bandwidth that they've been allocated.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And of course, a majority of the channels are music channels.

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So it's got to fit in somewhere.

243
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And we're happy to step aside for the rest of the week.

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I mean, not like overly joyous.

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But we're happy to do it.

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Particularly for the boss, not a problem, they're whatever.

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've tried out this.

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Have you heard about this, jaja.com?

249
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, I'm always looking to screw the man whenever possible.

250
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Of course, the phone company man is the man that's the most fun to screw.

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I saw this.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I was actually, here you go.

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Here's how podcasting works.

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was watching the scobal show, Robert Scobal of Microsoft fame.

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And now it's a pod tech has a podcast.

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And he interviews different CEOs and leaders of, I guess you'd have to say, web 2.0 companies.

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And then also let's them do a demo.

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And I ran across this, jaja.com, which is spelled J-A-J-A-H.com.

259
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So, Julia D'Alpha, Julia D'Alpha Hotel.com.

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And essentially, what these guys have put together is something that I'm so happy about this.

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You know, Patricia calls her mom and her sister and her mom and her sister.

262
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You know, several times on a daily basis, which easily easily can add up to 30, 40 pounds on a daily basis.

263
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because it's really expensive to call the Netherlands, particularly from the UK.

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So I'd hooked up with Skype.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I have to say Patricia really got into it.

266
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And I got her Bluetooth headset, so she could use it wirelessly,

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
at least in the kitchen, in the neighborhood of the computer.

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And then she enjoyed it.

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The quality, of course, not always that great, particularly on the other end.

270
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's always, you know, a complaint or two.

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And those of you who use Skype, you know, were used to it.

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And we, excuse me, since, hey, it was blend up.

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can usually get past it.

274
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But this jaja system, the way it works is, you have a number of telephone numbers,

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
which you can be called out.

276
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
My blackberry is an example.

277
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's entered as one of my, it's entered as my mobile number.

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
All I do is on a web page.

279
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I fill out the number that I want to dial.

280
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I click call.

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And then my phone will ring.

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I pick it up.

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And then you hear a voice saying, jaja is now connecting you to your party.

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And then, you know, the phone starts ringing and you have a conversation is normal.

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And it's literally going from my blackberry to the other end.

286
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm using my existing phone with any other phone that I am calling.

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Of course, the cost of that call.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
In this case, now remember, I'm using a US cell phone calling to the Netherlands.

289
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Cost 0.025 cents.

290
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So it's, it's an unbelievable 0.25 dollars, I'm sorry.

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So it's two cents.

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's like two and a half cents a minute, which is pretty much the Skype out rates, I think.

293
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't think that there's much difference in any voice over IP service that you can get rate wise.

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And, you know, these guys apparently have a voice over IP switching infrastructure set up,

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
so that they can handle all these different calls.

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now, some calls are going to be more expensive.

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Just like Skype, you know, you've got zones.

298
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And if you call a mobile phone, it's going to be disproportionately more expensive.

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But the cool thing, as I said, is, you know, you use your existing phone.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And I, and I said to Patricia, she said, okay, try this out.

301
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And she loves it.

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And she doesn't care how it works, you know, but she totally understands.

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And she's already building up on a dress book.

304
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And you can actually get a mobile version, not for the blackberry, but for Nokia and Motorola phones.

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And essentially it's just an extra address book.

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And it does the same thing.

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You know, you just choose the number, click call, then your phone rings,

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and then you're connected to your other party.

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And you cannot beat the price because it's the same price as Skype.

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But I think it's very, very, yeah, very user friendly.

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So, well, whenever Patricia's on the show, which hopefully will be tomorrow,

312
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
sometime this week, we'll get the load on and we'll find out if she's really enjoying it all that much.

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And if it's working for her.

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I did a conference call this morning, you can schedule conference calls as well.

315
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Even in advance, you just fill out the numbers you want.

316
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And you can even say when when it's supposed to call,

317
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and then your phone will ring and the other parties are connected.

318
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
If I can technology man, I love that shit.

319
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I love it to death.

320
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Last week, I mentioned that it would be great to do another one of these.

322
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And something we haven't done in a year and a few days,

323
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
we actually stopped at number 68.

324
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
When we last did this, not daily source code number 68,

325
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
but the 68th time we did this, we had the stop.

326
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I had the stop because we're going completely pod safe on the daily source code.

327
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So, only fitting that it be brought back just on this one special occasion

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
with episode number 69.

329
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Swasal Nuff is, of course, a beautiful number.

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Just kind of on a mark.

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm so happy that young pullet decided to do it.

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I would love to be able to continue with these.

333
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I think that we're at the point now a year further in time.

334
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think we're at the point where I can actually have a licensing conversation

335
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
with Ask Captain BMI about doing this feature in the daily source code and paying for it.

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'd love to pay for it as long as the price is within reason,

337
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
so that we could do more of the one and only hit test.

338
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hey Adam, young pullet here with another hit test for you.

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey baby, how you doing?

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Wow, it's been a year and a few days since the daily source code listeners have heard me say these words to you.

341
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I must say it was kind of surprised when the other day when you played the no-time generation song

342
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
of which I did the mastering you suddenly said you wanted to try another hit test.

343
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't know what the rules and regulations are right now, but what the hell?

344
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So I created this one.

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Today's hit test has four intros.

346
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Right on.

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And of course, also four answers.

348
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I can't afford and you're used to.

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's still a bit weird.

350
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Come on, man.

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let's do it.

352
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's have some fun too.

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Here we go.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
All right.

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Intro.

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Show them our second time around.

357
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I think.

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Second time around.

359
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And this is number two.

360
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think I have to give up on that one.

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Number three.

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah.

363
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah.

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can bring that one back.

365
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not going to fuck it up again.

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That would be Patricia with Saturday night.

367
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm not going to screw that one up again.

368
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And the final intro for today's hit test is number four.

369
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Is that hanging on a string?

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Uh, loose ends, new shoes, new shoes, loose ends hanging on a string.

371
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And that's it.

372
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And now let's see how we hit it.

373
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's left.

374
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's four answers.

375
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And answer number one.

376
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's a new one.

377
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I do one.

378
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
First time I've used this single in the hit test.

379
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

380
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
As answer number one.

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Show them on.

382
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Second time around.

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Woo.

384
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I know you don't belong away.

385
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Baby.

386
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
With me.

387
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're looking still.

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Be proud.

389
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You're looking.

390
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You're still being fast.

391
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You're looking down.

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's so much, it's a great year on the stop.

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's really nice.

394
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Alright. Now we got to get to number two which I did not know what it was.

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sure I're going to be kicking myself.

396
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Just second time around.

397
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well, this second time around is very short time.

398
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,800
it was a very short time because it's a one-time only thing sort of thing.

399
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,440
Shalomara's answer number one, the second answer is not a first.

400
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,800
You've missed this in an earlier hit-up.

401
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
No surprise.

402
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Feel fair and then go.

403
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
That's in tight.

404
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
It's a shit.

405
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,800
I can't believe I missed that one again.

406
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,800
So make sure that you're ready when you're not cold.

407
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I got it this time, I got it this time, buddy.

408
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Number three, in today's hit-up.

409
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:28,800
A song by your wife.

410
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
1979.

411
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:15,800
And please, Adam, tell me you didn't screw up again.

412
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Of course not expecting something like this.

413
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,800
In this one time only, it's just one year after the facts.

414
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Answer number three, Patricia and set it in ice.

415
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,800
And this is the fourth final answer in today's hit-up.

416
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
I'm going to say new shot.

417
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Also one you've missed.

418
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Real loose ends.

419
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I'll be singing on a train.

420
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I get a point for the title at least, I don't know.

421
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
I get a point for the title at least, I don't know.

422
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Answer number four, the final one, loose ends and hang in on a string.

423
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Well, I got, well, that's hit for this hit test.

424
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Two and a half out of four.

425
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Number 69.

426
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Man, so much has happened in the last year.

427
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I haven't added the audio in this way for a long time.

428
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I want to a sweeper's audio imaging and mastering.

429
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
That's more the work I'm doing lately.

430
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
So if you need something, check it out.

431
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,800
It's at youngpooled.com, JNPOLAT.com.

432
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Well, it was kind of weird recording.

433
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Hit the score, Adam.

434
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
How was it for you?

435
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I hope you enjoyed it.

436
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,800
And maybe until somewhere in the near future,

437
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
where this can all be legal again.

438
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
We can have fun playing music on podcasts.

439
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Not only podcasts, but like you said, music from the soundtricks of our lives.

440
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Well, thank you for playing.

441
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Maybe until the next time.

442
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,800
So take care, and until then, bye-bye.

443
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Back to test at gmail.com.

444
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Info, youngpool.com.

445
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,800
TNPOLAT.com.

446
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Yon, you've outdone yourself, my friend.

447
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Thank you so much.

448
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
That was fantastic.

449
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Big smile on my face here right now.

450
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Really big smile.

451
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I would love to do this more often.

452
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Oh, be so much fun.

453
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Wouldn't it?

454
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
The music from the soundtrack to your lives?

455
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
That's what it is, man.

456
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
We're missing all this good.

457
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I love podcasts, music.

458
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
I love independently produced music.

459
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
I love everything that we can play in podcasts.

460
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,800
But I really, really do miss even just those snippets of those songs.

461
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,800
You know, and just a triggering memories and thoughts in your brain about when you heard that,

462
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,800
you know, the first time you heard it, the most recent time you heard it,

463
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
which was probably a long time ago.

464
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,800
As I said, we're, you know, I'm really ready to get into negotiations to be able to do this type of programming.

465
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
It would be so nice.

466
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,800
So if we pull it together young, then definitely my friend.

467
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Most definitely, we'd get that together.

468
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Let me see.

469
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Oh, yes.

470
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,800
I wanted to play this promo for you because it's so fucking weird.

471
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Hello.

472
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I'm here to plug a new podcast called Freelance America.

473
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,800
You see, some of you over there in our former colony obviously don't feel free enough,

474
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
and now want to work for yourselves.

475
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
I mean, how much freedom do you people need?

476
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
You live in the land of the free.

477
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
You lead the free world.

478
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
You've even been known to eat freedom fires for goodness sake,

479
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
and far more of them than is good for you, frankly.

480
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
What more do you want to run around naked,

481
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,800
flapping your arms while singing Belinda Carlisle's live your life before you?

482
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Not everywhere can be like San Francisco, you know?

483
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Well, anyway.

484
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
In case you haven't already guessed, Freelance America is a podcast all about freelancing,

485
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,800
providing tips on motivation, tax issues, and marketing yourself.

486
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Oh, and it's free to download.

487
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Obviously, check it out at freelanceamerica.lipsin.com.

488
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
That's something.

489
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Personally, I think one of them table manners is a much bigger priority.

490
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Dude, I don't think the United States was ever officially a colony of the United Kingdom.

491
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I think that people left to go found the new country.

492
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
You really can't get that straight dude.

493
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,800
You colonize a lot, but not the good old USFA.

494
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Clearly, Yanks versus the British.

495
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
And now we're from our spine here.

496
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,800
It's the Yanks versus the Brits.

497
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,800
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's a parent to see.

498
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
They're just like you and me, it's the Yanks.

499
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
And the Brits have to adapt.

500
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,800
The Yanks versus the Brits.

501
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Mind the gap.

502
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Boy, we're going to see a lot of that Yanks versus the Brits stuff in the next coming weeks.

503
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,800
In November, when we launch BTpodshow.com, we're going to have so much cool stuff there.

504
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,800
It's really, of course, there already is a plethora of UK content available.

505
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,800
By the way, a shitload of, you know, we've really been trying to flesh out what we want to highlight in channels.

506
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,800
And, you know, we feel that there's just like onpodshow.com.

507
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,800
There's a lot of mainstream content, which is very good.

508
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Oh, sincere.

509
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
With Splenda.

510
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
A lot of BBC stuff, which is good.

511
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Some of the newspapers, like the Guardian, do some really good podcasts.

512
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
And we're going to be mixing that up as usual.

513
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,800
With, you know, as much independent stuff as we can get our hands on, obviously.

514
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
And we've already been working together with a lot of people.

515
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,800
And here's something that I'm trying to pull together, which is, I think, going to be very exciting.

516
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,800
This is through our serious satellite radio contacts.

517
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
The Who is currently on tour.

518
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:00,800
And Pete Townsend's girlfriend, Rachel Fuller, has, who, I think, she's a, yeah, she has an album out as well.

519
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Had an album out, she's a musician as well.

520
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I might add, she's somewhat younger than Pete, and very feisty.

521
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,800
They've been doing shows after the Who shows, usually with the, with the artists who open up for the band on that particular gig.

522
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
They've been doing it.

523
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Let's see, on the US tour, they were doing it in the back of their air stream trailer.

524
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Some of it's in hotel room, some of it's backstage.

525
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,800
And literally, you know, Pete will hop on the guitar, and everyone's jammed along and singing.

526
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:37,800
And so, you know, at this very moment, we're now discussing, how can we get these episodes featured on BDpodshow.com.

527
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,800
And how can we, you know, and there's more new episodes to come as the, as the second, like,

528
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,800
a second, like, a second or third leg of the tour kicks into gear.

529
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,800
And so, I've been going back and forth with Rachel and with the Who Management and, and, and,

530
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Kerry, who, who really is working with me on this right now.

531
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,800
She sent me something extremely cool to want to play for you because, you know,

532
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,800
how often do you get to hear some classic, classic Pete Townsend live, unplugged, and completely unrehearsed?

533
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I've been given the permission to play this on the show.

534
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Check out Baba O'Reilly featuring Pete Townsend.

535
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800

536
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Okay, now, with the favourite legs in this tiny little attic room.

537
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Right.

538
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800

There you go.

543
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Two, one, two, three, four.

544
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:51,800
I'll get my fucking tune, I'll let it out.

545
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I don't need to find someone to prove to me.

546
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,800
I don't need to find someone to prove to me.

547
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,800
I don't need to find someone to prove to me.

548
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,800
To prove or not.

549
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I don't need to be forgiven.

550
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
No, no, no, no, no.

551
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
There we go.

552
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,800
It's only teenage waste.

553
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
So I'll take my hand.

554
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,800
