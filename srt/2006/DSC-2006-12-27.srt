1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Ah, the festive period once again. It's time to give each other presents and receive presents

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,000
and say thanks and then put them on eBay.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,680
M-R-M-P-D-D-D-P-T-P-O-D-O-D-O-O-K.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Delta Sierra Charlie 5-1-Niner.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Was introduced to me.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The music melted through the end.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I love the category.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I've all the other people there.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If it wasn't Halloween, don't tell me if these two exist.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We're all equipped by me and you.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's not true.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We just can't try them, but we won't let you.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I love you so unique.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I know it happens every day.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can't see that one to me.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Andy Stone, in the coffee shop, blended.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's on the pod safe music network.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And that was suggested by...

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hold on a second. I got a holy mail here.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
First of all, let me say.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can probably tell there's a difference in the configuration of the sound today.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And not just the difference in the configuration of the studio, but a difference in

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
configuration in my face.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes, today.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
See, boxing day, second day of Christmas in many parts of the world.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I awoke to find my left cheek somewhat swollen.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's not exactly what's happened, but I'm pretty sure there's a route of one of my teeth.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's affected my sinuses.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know, man.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's not pretty to look at.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Since I was up at 6 a.m. anyway, the pain basically woke me up.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I forget I wanted to get the show out of the way and get it all crank.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So kind of a mellow start.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was going to say that was sent in by Andy Stone.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Just listen to this about that record.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I really liked that track.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I really liked it. He says, um, do you know how to inform

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
my epic recording artist Danny Malone from Dodding for Pearls?

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Who later made an album for Atlantic with Elliot Easton of the cars in the early 90s?

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's handling vocals on my latest bird inspired melody and hook driven for song project.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And so he goes on to explain what's going on.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But of course, you can find it the pod safe music network.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Which means if you have a podcast, you're free to use that on your show.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hey, everybody. How you doing? Hope you had a good Christmas.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry. I just don't have all the energy because literally the left side of my face

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
is all taught and and puffy.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So I can't do my normal.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
My normal upbeat up tempo crap coming to you from the curry cottage.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Of course in the affluent suburb of Surrey.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This is the daily source code episode 519.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Had a fantastic Christmas actually.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It always seems to happen.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Whatever I'm nice and relaxed and everything's all chilled out.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And we're just hanging out with the family.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's always when I get sick.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're going vacation.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The first three days of course.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going to be sick.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But otherwise, it was great.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Of course, I did all my well.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let me rewind back to Friday.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We had the BT pod show holiday party at the UK crash pad in Shortage and London.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A lot of fun.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'd never really been to a Christmas party in the UK.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So this was without it out my first.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Man.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You brits really do like to drink and it's not like you're drinking a lot.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, you are.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But you just it's like people are literally excited about drinking.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And you know me, I'm not at all a guy who likes to drink.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I smoke my pleasures.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I had a glass or two and it was a lot of fun.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Getting kind of wasted with everybody.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And there were people there who represented shows that are on the BT pod show.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think actually a Neil done a pretty good job.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He invited some other people who aren't.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We don't are in a member of the network.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But a lot of fun on the less you from story nori was there.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That was cool to meet him.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think I've met him before actually.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But I actually got to talk to him this time.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Just to chill out a bit.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A Scott from the night nurse show.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's very funny.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sweet guy.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And let's see.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So I was one of those days where I was able to, you know, arrive at the train station.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Both coming out and going home.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Just minutes before the train left.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So it was fantastic.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was home around 10 o'clock, 10.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
30.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And that's really when everything just kind of started.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Just the chill out mellow mood.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We had a fantastic Christmas.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Just the three of us.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Since we really hadn't been together for a couple of weeks.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Very nice.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And usually we, you know, Christmas is pretty much our own family affair.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We rarely celebrate that with the other members of the family.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's just just Patricia Kristina and I.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And of course, we got Kristina all kinds of cool stuff.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Which is always fun.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Patricia and I went shopping on Saturday.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, Saturday went shopping together.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And we got her, well, the one thing she really wanted.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Which isn't, it wasn't a huge, a huge request.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Was an Nintendo DS light.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Of course, the pink version was somewhat of an extra request.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We had to run around town a couple of different stores to find a pink Nintendo DS light.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Those things are pretty awesome, by the way.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If you have two of them that connect wirelessly.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can connect to a Wi-Fi and play with people over the internet.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The graphics are quite astounding.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How they fit all of that for 99 pounds into into one little box is beyond me.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But the gift that she has been using the most.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I love this about our daughter.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I gave her a book.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You know, I love giving away books.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I spent a lot of time in the bookstore.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I got a book for Patricia, which is the Victoria Beckham book,

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
which is actually a very well-produced book.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Great pictures.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you're into fashion.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's all about fashion and style.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It looks like a fashion, a team of fashion editors from a magazine.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Put this book together.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's really pretty.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And for Kristina, I got was a Jackie Collins novel.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
She loves reading trash like that.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And this one was called a titled Hollywood Kids.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I thought she'd get a kick out of seeing what she is not yet.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But soon can become.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And let's see.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, oh yeah, of course, we got the karaoke machine out.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's always cool.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Sing along on Christmas.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And yesterday, Boxing Day really just took it easy.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Watched a lot of television.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There was some great TV on here.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Both Christmas Eve.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Christmas Day.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And Boxing Day.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Second day of Christmas.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It was just really nice, except, of course, my face would start to swell up.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And all of this just days before we start our big move to the new curry cottage.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm Steve.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know what's like in the States.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know what's like in your house.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And it was actually, but you know, you can.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a bit of a tradition that when you move yourself into a new house.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You have a, what's called a housewarming party.

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Um, yeah, just close and all the address and the assignment will be there with a few bones of beer.

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Cheers, man.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Bye.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, okay.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's a great idea.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm sure, Patricia will love it.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You need to come over and stop some potato chips right into the woodwork.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You know, it's, um, it's a small courtesy, but I'm happy you're willing to do it for me.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oops.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
By the error.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey, Adam, what's happening to do this Kevin Reeves?

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Dude, this whole thing about Patricia and a record.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is a perfect opportunity for a bunch of us to get together.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And she could release jazz versions or valid versions of a lot of the.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Top tunes that are on the pod safe music network.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sure that Matthew evil got some stuff that could be read,

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
cut and rework.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Jeff, this has stuff that we recut reworked.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Common Tyler myself.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sure there's a bunch of them that we could do.

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And then it would be automatically pod safe.

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Everybody would obviously, you know, sign a waiver to make that work.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And, um, man, let's do it.

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's, let's make it happen.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So, uh, just, uh, I don't know.

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's open some dialogue about it.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Let's see what we can do.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
All right, man.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll check me out.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Kevin Reeves got net.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Have a good one.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Bye.

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
All right.

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Of course, buddy.

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Very happy holidays and happy new year to you.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Kevin Reeves.

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Just check them out of the pod safe music network.

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Kevin.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This whole story has really gotten some legs.

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now, um, another one of Patricia's, um, celebrity.

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Wimmit was he, uh, is he a judge or, no, he's just, he's one of the celebrity dancers

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
on the dancing with the stars, which by the way, aired last night.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Uh, highest rated program of the evening.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Uh, although Patricia did not come in first place.

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In fact, I think she came in dead last.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Uh, of the contestants, which, uh, I'm sure she'll come on the show tomorrow

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and explain why.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And of course, I knew that she came in last.

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I also know what happens during her second dance.

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So I've been sworn to secrets so I can't say anything.

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Um, but, um, uh, one of her, uh, her co, uh, celebrities on the show

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
is Edick from Tang.

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And he's a very well-known record producer in the Netherlands.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He's been around for about 20 years, I think.

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He's produced, uh, some pretty big, uh, hits, you know, very 80s, poppy type stuff.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Um, he also approved some damn goods, uh, uh, good album with Patricia at one point.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And, um, they've kind of taken this idea of these songs and taken a little bit

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
further.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You see, there's a huge hole in the market.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Um, uh, if you, if you, um,

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
consider that there are so many people who actually take dancing classes.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And that there's just not enough new music, good material, um, available, uh,

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
to dance to.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's always the same kind of songs.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And of course, you know, you need your, your quick step and your fucks

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
trot and your wallets and your samba and all that stuff.

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And so that they've been kicking around this idea of dancing with Patricia.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Which I think is a fantastic idea.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Uh, so I'm, I'm just kind of stepping back.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have no idea what's going to go on.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I love the idea.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Although, you know, you guys all stand by yourself.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You know, you, you've got such great careers.

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You've got such great music, uh, all on the podcast music network.

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I, I think Patricia should figure it out herself.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And, uh, now, of course, she's still going to do this thing with the, with the

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Jeff Smith.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I know Jeff has been really busy.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And he's coming back to with the rework version of his, uh,

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
of the song that he, uh, that he wrote for for their duet together.

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And that's still a project that we're working on.

235
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But, uh, I'll keep you, uh,

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll keep you up to speed on what's going on with the dancing with the stars project.

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'd like the idea because, you know,

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
that's something that there's a very definite audience for.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You don't have to have a number one radio hit to actually sell any CDs.

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Um, and now I'm just presuming that this wouldn't be a podsafe album.

241
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Because it'll probably be a lot of standards or maybe a couple of new songs,

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
which I hope she would make podsafe.

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Um, but that's a very different market than hey, you know,

244
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
we have to get played on the top three radio stations in order to get enough exposure.

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And there's a huge budget for marketing.

246
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And then maybe we'll sell, uh, you know, 100,000 records,

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
which is pretty much the state of affairs today in the music business.

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This business is dying off.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I'm thinking about, um,

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
on the last show of the year, really, uh,

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
looking back at what's happened to the music industry, um,

252
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and perhaps making a few predictions for 2007.

253
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But first, we've got to deal with some of this podsafe stuff.

254
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay, Adam, you have some spleen and to do on DSE 516, we hear.

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If they write them, that's fine, but I want to be able to release them podsafe,

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
which means, you know, they're probably not going to make any money.

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What was that again?

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Probably not going to make any money.

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Now, what do you mean by, they won't make any money?

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I guess that means that the whole podsafe music network is for nothing.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And music podcasting is a waste of time.

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Sorry, Adam, but I don't agree.

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And wish you had chosen some better words.

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, I think you misunderstood what I'm saying.

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I love the pod.

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Come on.

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I've been part of the podsafe music revolution.

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We set up the podsafe music network because we believe in it.

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
However, I really don't believe we're going to see massive multimillion selling CDs

270
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
or tracks anymore in the near future.

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Again, this is something I definitely want to talk about at the end of the year.

272
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But if you put it all together, if you look at the way record companies are making money,

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
they're not making money on CD sales alone.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's on the publishing.

275
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's on licensing.

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's on merchandising.

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And of course, they also take a piece of the touring.

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If there's any money available in that.

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I mean, there's so many different avenues and bands and artists are independent companies.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And now they have all the tools to do this themselves.

281
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's the whole point.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The podsafe music and playing music on podcasts is just a small piece of it.

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
By itself, I don't think it.

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It a career of great wealth.

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This, of course, is going to be a couple of huge breakout hates that just happened.

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That every, you know, this viral is like viral videos.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Of course, that's going to happen.

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But because we now have tens of thousands of podcasts and hundreds of thousands of tracks

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
supply does it mean that people will be making money hand over foot, probably not,

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
not just based upon the track sales.

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But when I see the relationships that have been built up, the relationships between artists,

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
fans and people who want to promote them just want to help them out for free by playing

293
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
them on their podcasts, that's where the magic is.

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And that's where there's a hell of a lot of good things to be done.

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And yes, indeed, money to be made.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

297
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You know, when he said, you got some slain into do.

299
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
For a second there, I thought it was going to say, you got some splendour to track.

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And of course, portions of the day show brought to you by splendor, the substitute for sugar.

301
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You know, I haven't heard from people about splendor in a while.

302
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Are we still mixing it up?

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Are we still trying different flavors?

304
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Are we still trying to come up with a great new master's solution for making my senseo

305
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
coffee taste even better?

306
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Love to hear from you.

307
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
All right, this is Ron from zip71101 podcast located at zip.punchow.com.

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Last week, I spoke to Rock and Roll legend Dale Hawkins.

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He wrote and recorded Susie Q and 1957.

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And that was a smash hit.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He wrote and recorded Susie Q and 1957.

312
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And that was a smash hit.

313
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He wrote and recorded Susie Q and 1957.

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And that was a smash hit.

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He wrote and recorded Susie Q and 1957.

316
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And that was a smash hit.

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Guitarist James Burton, who was only 15 years old, played those famous guitar licks.

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Susie Q was also chosen as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 songs

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
that shaped rock and roll.

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I've got the interview with the legend, Dale Hawkins.

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Zip.punchow.com.

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
All right, I did a source code episode 519.

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Our Gile Pems.

324
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

325
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I think you should buy us a drink.

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
At least.

328
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I've never felt this good in my entire life.

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Make me some of the spaghetti.

330
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

331
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah.

332
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah.

333
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We are the Gile Pems.

334
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We're the Gile Pems.

335
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We're the Gile Pems.

336
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We're the Gile Pems.

337
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We're the Gile Pems.

338
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We're the Gile Pems.

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We're the Gile Pems.

340
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000

379
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm feeling positively nauseous from the massive quantities of ibuprofen I've been taking

380
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,960
as well as a swishling suit gargling with salt water and all kinds of other medicines I

381
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,400
feel horrible. I have a feeling it's going to be a rude canal or some crap like that just

382
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,080
oh something I don't need today at all. So anyway I have no idea how this how the setup sounds

383
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,720
I worked all day yesterday through the pain I want you to know. I've now I was in preparation

384
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,920
for the move I had to start cleaning shit up in the studio and I have had so many different setups

385
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,720
over the years. So many different mixing boards and configurations and it was a complete spaghetti

386
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,480
factory behind the podcast console. So now what I've done is I've set it up with the Yamaha

387
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,840
the Alpha Whiskey 16 Golf. Remember that's the digital mixing console. I've set that up and runs it

388
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,840
and has some inline processing and I've really I'm not just not sure if it sounds right yet

389
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,920
but I did work on a whole bunch of sounds and setups and I've got the old what is that this

390
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,560
hold on let me take a look at it. Yeah the sound crap for board. I've got that one set up kind of as a

391
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:54,080
headphone mixer so that I can hear exactly what's going into cast blaster which of course is

392
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,080
still a part of the setup and I even resurrected an old power book G4 for some multi track stuff.

393
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,520
So it's it's kind of looking good and literally half of the wires I had I was able to put into one

394
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,320
of the boxes. So now when the movers come of course this is a story I've convinced Patricia I was

395
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,240
really busy doing. I was really just reconfiguring the studio but I told her it was like preparing

396
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,800
for the move but it is true that now when the movers come I know exactly what wires I need what

397
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,280
plugs what to extension cord they all go into one box all of the computer stuff can go into the

398
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,680
you know boxes right nearby and it'll be completely ready for unpacking because let's be honest it's the

399
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:41,520
first thing I'm going to unpack. Hey fans of daily source code come and check out our holiday

400
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:50,160
Christmas video podcast at rockinrolltv.net also seen at rockinrolltv.podshow.com. Happy holiday!

401
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,800
Sharon Ross. I had a mid-cert Patrick from a not so what did I say?

402
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,040
What did I say that? I meant Sharon Bam of course. I had a mid-cert Patrick from a not so

403
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:10,960
affluent suburb of East Sussex just wanted to make a comment on your remarks regarding fog in the

404
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,640
DSC 518. I'm a commercial pilot based down here in Gatwick and I fly the Boeing 737 400 series.

405
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,800
How hard is that? I fly the Boeing 737 service series Rura and in common with many of our

406
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:32,080
colleagues in the modern airplanes of today we can in fact land automatically fully automatically

407
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,640
without touching the controls and we don't need to see very much we need to be able to see

408
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,480
something one light at 50 feet that's our reference. And as is not a very modern airplane if you're

409
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,000
getting to something more sophisticated like say the triple seven they can land because they got

410
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,480
better systems more at London sense on. They can land with no visibility, no lights, nobody's seeing anything

411
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,760
and the whole airplane will just touch down, land, stop itself on the runway on the centre line,

412
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,880
no trouble at all. And most of the modern airplanes can do that even the smaller air buses and everything.

413
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,600
Oh nearly forgot. Yes, of course you are. Oh pilots are full. Now that's not true. Not all pilots.

414
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,720
Yeah, I stand corrected on a couple of things that I said there. So I knew that modern aircraft

415
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
could do that. I actually wasn't aware that they could completely do everything and come to a full

416
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,880
stop all by themselves. That's pretty fucking amazing technology. Although I didn't know that a lot

417
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
of aircraft certainly can take you all the way down to the runway. I didn't know the 737

418
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,720
was capable of doing that. I also have received numerous reports from people that yes indeed there

419
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,560
are many airfields with ground radar. Skippel airport in the Netherlands has ground radar.

420
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,440
Thank you Alexander for that. Although I'm not sure if if he throw has that a crap to

421
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,320
satellite window closed when I wasn't looking. Sorry about that serious folks.

422
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,040
At Brittany Mason who you probably know from second life has started a podcast. It's very

425
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,240
shit is getting to me. I think I got to play one last song for you. Then I'm going to get

426
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:26,240
ready to go to the dentist Fiona's nice enough to see me at 1215 which is why I'm recording

427
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,800
early at figure. If work needs to be done, if we need 50 hour maintenance job, you're not going
